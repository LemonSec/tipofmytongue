1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,980
all right all right

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,720
past and present thank you

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,369
colt so my second greatest fear with
this presentation was that the room is

4
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:24,448
going to be empty

5
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,480
my greatest fear was that is going to be
packed so I think we're like a happy

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,420
medium here you can like exploit both of
my fears

7
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,309
so that's me get the usual disclaimer
out of the way for educational purposes

8
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:36,300
only

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,000
you know real fraudsters and all this
stuff works already i'm not telling

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,800
anybody anything they don't know

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,030
these opinions are all my own you know
don't blame me don't blame my employer

12
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,410
you can play me that's for sure

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,819
this is about me is you graduate from
wayne state university 1993 with a green

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,559
anthropology and I've been

15
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,099
who it's been a while since I've been
back on campus but ever since then I've

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,609
been using my my learning for for good
and evil

17
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:04,229
I've been an i.t i.t scary for about 20
years I've been a strictly on the cyber

18
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:06,689
security side now for the past four
years

19
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,610
I an internal pentester so I work on our
pen testing and I leave physical

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,920
penetration testing team for a financial
institution so i get to essentially

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,100
break into banks but it's the same bank
over and over again

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,960
I have an interest in state magic and
con artist so the the birth of this

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,809
presentation was was twofold one of them
was

24
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,439
I'm constantly having to train new pen
testers so I was kind of looking for new

25
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,189
ways that explain to them how this works
and give them something to anchor it to

26
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,479
the other one is my management loves to
tell us what we know you can tell get

27
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,840
into a facility what else you got so
we're constantly being challenged to

28
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,950
come up with new ways to use social
engineering so if you if we tell get

29
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,700
into a facility right that's testing one
control are so sure security awareness

30
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,610
control but we still have gatekeepers
everywhere

31
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,820
so we're always being asked you know
generate scenarios that actually tests

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,579
are gatekeepers so those are always
face-to-face social engineering

33
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,539
scenarios we walk into a building and
and test a guard or a gatekeeper

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,180
so that's sort of where this came from
was trying to find additional

35
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,259
inspiration for you know how we're going
to generate those scenarios

36
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,140
the specifics let me go up to the big
picture you know Trust is necessary for

37
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:24,000
society but people base their trust
decisions on weird things especially you

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,610
know when they're given a first
impression

39
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,210
even when Trust decisions are based on
fact sometimes those facts can be

40
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:35,580
manipulated and con artists of the past
a lot of examples of you know how they

41
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,310
violated people's trust

42
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,530
i'm going to talk specifically about a
couple of characters from the unit

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,110
united states in the twenties and
thirties

44
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,280
one of them is JR yellow kid while this
guy operated as a con artist in the

45
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,110
American Midwest

46
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:56,970
he worked out of Chicago although he
committed his cons all over Indiana

47
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,700
Illinois Ohio Michigan

48
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,690
he had a lot of long cons real estate
cons mining cons

49
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,470
these were very they are very personal
he got to know people he worked with

50
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,120
them for weeks before he took a lot of
their money in his biography he talks

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,960
about another con artist did he cross
paths with paths with this other guy

52
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,090
Charles willing

53
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,080
who's known as the buttering kid so I'm
trying to set up a dichotomy here

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,490
between two kinds of con artists one is
yellow kid who worked long cons he he

55
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,500
did very specific personal cons our
friend the buttering kid his con for his

56
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,970
entire career was selling buttering
which is margarine as butter

57
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,930
so when margin first came out it costs a
lot less than butter and it had to be

58
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:40,620
white

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,340
when margins first produced it comes out
white get the diet make it look yellow

60
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,820
where there's lots that you couldn't die
yellow because the dairy interested want

61
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:51,120
that what this guy would buy margin diet
yellow and go sell it on the street is

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,880
Gary freshman dairy fresh butter

63
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,600
so that was his con that's a real short
con right you want somebody to go hey

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,380
you want some fresh butter and you know
you sell for 25 cents a pound or

65
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,640
whatever it was

66
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,299
the funny thing is both of these guys
spent time in federal prison jail while

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,660
primate million dollars in his day
conning people on real estate deals

68
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,109
buttering kid went to federal prison for
doctoring margarine

69
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,470
so you both these guys are criminals but
they operate in very different ways

70
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,989
so in our modern

71
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:21,988
scenario i want to compare these two
guys to what we've got today

72
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,530
so we still got about the buttering kids
running around right these are sort of

73
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,330
your mass spammers from an evolutionary
biology standpoint these guys you the

74
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,229
our strategy right they have lots of
babies they send out hundreds of emails

75
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:38,460
and they hope that one of those little
babies you know hits the market survive

76
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,530
to adulthood and make some money

77
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:45,090
they're going with volume the nice thing
about these guys and I think we're very

78
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,619
good at detecting them is they make a
lot of noise they follow patterns that

79
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,909
there's a there's a very there's a
footprint for what they're doing so on

80
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:57,630
the other hand we have a sort of yellow
kids in the world who are much more

81
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,819
specific they're much more personal

82
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,270
these guys use targeted attacks they do
things like you know spearfishing

83
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,150
they're very methodical they're willing
to spend time they're going for the big

84
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,068
score in evolutionary biology contacts
they're using the case strategy they're

85
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,580
going to have less babies but they're
going to hope that you know they invest

86
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,599
a lot of energy in them

87
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:20,880
that's going to pay off again in the
historical context did Jerry Jerry while

88
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,870
the yellow kid made lots of money but he
made it in from a small number of

89
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,770
victims as opposed to you know spreading
his his joy across the world

90
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,840
so let's talk about how you establish
trust so you can violate it

91
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,258
there's a few elements that i'm going to
talk about there's more than this

92
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,750
there's all kinds of psychology research
out there

93
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,120
I make it on a few sort of key points
and try to tie it to both the yellow kid

94
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,469
and and what we do today

95
00:05:46,469 --> 00:05:49,560
so first we have what's called the a
factor istic and I'll talk about that

96
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,919
this is the gut feeling when you know
you walk to somebody or like I got a

97
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,359
good feeling about that guy

98
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,139
con artists are great at this they're
generally people people people right

99
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,639
there a person person they are good at
talking to people they're good at you

100
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,759
know siding up to someone in a bar and
striking up a conversation

101
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:09,750
so you're trying to Train somebody how
to do that you have to go back to

102
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,020
fundamentals you're like what are people
basing this decision to trust you on

103
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,539
then there's some harder things that
people can go harder facts that people

104
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:21,270
used to base trust one is expertise

105
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:25,349
people can ask her credentials obviously
and then there's a whole concept of you

106
00:06:25,349 --> 00:06:28,949
know if you act trustworthy people will
think you're trustworthy so we'll talk

107
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,550
about each of those in turn

108
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,660
let's talk about a factor istic first so
this is a quote from the yellow kids

109
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,010
biography he's just talking about a
businessman he met he was in there with

110
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,909
one of his confederates and they were
trying to get this guy to do business

111
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:43,660
with them

112
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,720
it's going to be business that was very
much to the detriment of businessman

113
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,640
so this is a very handy way of saying
what everybody knows right

114
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,210
is look the part if you're trying to
talk to business people you're going to

115
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:00,820
look like visit people this is you know
pretty intuitive but ironically in this

116
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,870
case because you know appearances and
how people judge people on European how

117
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,990
people judge you on your appearance or
frequent based on stereotypes are based

118
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:12,130
on stupid stuff but that's how people
work and stereotypes change over time so

119
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:16,510
the interesting and kind of ironic thing
about this particular conversation he

120
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,800
was having is this is in the interwar
years and part of his khan was going

121
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,740
around the Midwest and convincing
business people that he was representing

122
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,370
the German government who were
interested in investing in American

123
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,610
industry people knew there was a war
coming in Europe but that didn't mean

124
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:34,330
could make money off of it so people
were willing to trust him if you look

125
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,690
like a businessman and more importantly
looked like he had to cash to back that

126
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,410
up

127
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,060
so you know again the a factor istic
nobody speaks German could be a bad guy

128
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:48,160
I a factor istic all comes down to
appearances and stereotypes

129
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,120
so there's a few this first one wolves
to 1977 this comes from my anthropology

130
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
background

131
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,880
he wrote an article called about
identifying stylistic messages

132
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:05,950
I've got in the references i think it's
a stylistic behavior and appearance and

133
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,360
have to start that over

134
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,720
I

135
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:17,220
anyway what's this . wasn't he studied
in Yugoslavia his point was that people

136
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:23,220
have to identify others from a distance
and as you get closer to the person the

137
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,800
stylistic messages that they're
transmitting become more and more

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,849
specific so when you get slavia case you
know he was saying people identified at

139
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,370
great distances by what they were
wearing on their heads because that was

140
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,310
really easy to see from a long ways away
as we got closer and closer they had

141
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,819
smaller and smaller details that broke
them down and smaller and smaller social

142
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,170
groups so in a social engineering
context you know what we're saying what

143
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:50,550
i'm saying is you know think about the
way you're presenting yourself both up

144
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,640
close and from a distance are things
like hats

145
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:58,500
outerwear things like that can influence
somebody before you ever even make

146
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,680
contact as they see you coming you know
your gate

147
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,890
the way you carry yourself are you in a
hurry are you nervous all of those

148
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:08,430
things help establish whether you're
trustworthy whether you seem like a

149
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,209
threat

150
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,350
the whole point of the effector istic is
people will make decisions about whether

151
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,670
or not to trust you whether or not you
are a risk based on things that are not

152
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,810
entirely scientific so the longer you
get the target time to develop positive

153
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,050
impression better you are the more
likely you are to overcome any negative

154
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:27,780
stereotypes they might have you coming
in

155
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,310
there's another principle here this
actually comes from deception military

156
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,339
deception Magruder's principle which is
exploit preconceptions

157
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,450
this is just another way of saying that
person's got a stereotype reinforce it

158
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,900
you know if you if you can reinforce
that stereotype feed into it it's much

159
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:49,079
easier to reinforce an existing
preconception than try to change it and

160
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,010
you know that's just a a precept of
deception if you're going to deceive

161
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,100
somebody try to work with what they
already believe and just make that

162
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:01,290
erroneous beliefs stronger again hats
shirts outerwear that kind of stuff and

163
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:07,170
as a concrete example if you ever want
to really raise the hackles of somebody

164
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:09,810
walk into a bank wearing a hat and
sunglasses why

165
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,979
that's what bank robbers we're right
tellers hate that I mean nothing will

166
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:17,490
freak them out from a distance more than
a dude walking into a bank wearing a

167
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,000
ball cap and set sunglasses because
they're on alert

168
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,519
that so I'm just an example this guy
from a distance rate it presents two

169
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,209
very different opinions and people is
going to vote two very different

170
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,319
responses

171
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,250
there's a dude in England he actually
that it doesn't hurt it doesn't help his

172
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,279
case any that those are all like white
supremacist tattoos

173
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,790
he went through the process of having
those remove heat sort of announced his

174
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,019
his previous beliefs and had them
renewed really had them removed so this

175
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,670
is the before and after picture but
that's definitely two different Aphex in

176
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,290
people when they look at him

177
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,500
one of the things you notice is he
smiling one picture not thats you know

178
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,440
another thing about being warm at least
in the United States

179
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,130
keep in mind that a lot of these things
are culturally specific so in the u.s.

180
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,810
warm handshake smile

181
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,439
people love you in Russia you smile they
think you're stupid or you want

182
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,190
something

183
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,120
so that's why you know slobs I'll have a
very businesslike attitude because

184
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,120
people just don't smile and you're up to
something if you do

185
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,630
so how about that

186
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,120
I see that hot button it goes

187
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,089
current slide so let's move on expertise
again this is a quote from Jerry wiles

188
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:41,150
biography and I want to tell a little
story that this relates to because it it

189
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,829
exemplifies you know how you can
convince people you have expertise when

190
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:50,120
you don't and in his particular case

191
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,650
so this is our friend Jerry while on the
right is pokey aight man he's a mining

192
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,520
engineer

193
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:59,630
I mcclure's magazine which is the
nationwide magazine 1914 published a

194
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,390
series of articles called hundred
thousand dollars a year men

195
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,920
those guys who made lots of money doing
what they did for their employer so our

196
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,760
friend the yellow kid found every copy
of mcclure's magazine he could get his

197
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,689
hands on you took it to his friend who
is kind of a shady printer and he had a

198
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:19,610
reprint the front page of that article
just reprint the photographs that was a

199
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:22,850
photograph of him and set up hope you
ate meant everything else the magazine

200
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,480
stayed the same rebound magazine and
then he'd have some friends of his go to

201
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,940
the local public library where ever he
was working

202
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,930
ask for the McClure's bound addition you
know as a few years after it come out

203
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,579
that are bound in archives and they
don't sneak away somewhere and replace

204
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,740
the addition of magazine with his doctor
version then as he was working a scam in

205
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,140
town he suddenly drop or a Confederate
drop that hated you see that article

206
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,110
about Pope gateman know you have a copy
of it

207
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,260
well no but I'm sure it's in your Public
Library they go to the public library

208
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,439
pick it up find out what this guy made a
hundred thousand dollars a year is a

209
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,360
mining engineer he must know what he's
talking about

210
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,470
of course he was trying to sell them
worth mining stock the point of this is

211
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,430
you again this is a very targeted
strategy I mean he put a lot of work

212
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:11,029
into this but it had a big payoff
because as soon as people saw that

213
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,270
magazine in their hometown and they
actually had to do some work to do it

214
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,250
wasn't handing on magazine here read
this

215
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,150
nope that's over in your library and you
go do that so you're making that it

216
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,640
feels to them like they're doing the
work right there

217
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:27,140
finding these things out for themselves
doesn't supply today well we all have

218
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,660
sock puppet accounts and LinkedIn right

219
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,490
this is a similar process now it doesn't
require that I sneak a magazine way I

220
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,490
just have to generate a linkedin account
that people trust

221
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,430
I can say anything I want a linkedin
account right

222
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:46,410
I can even get indoors or experience
that I don't have

223
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:50,970
so I don't know anything about mining by
the way I I no less than nothing about

224
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:51,510
mining

225
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:55,380
I took a geology class in high school
that's as far as it goes so mining

226
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,830
engineer sound like a cool title when I
was like I'm going to create a fake

227
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,070
you know mining profile mining engineer
it sounds good has engineering has

228
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,450
mining it can't go wrong

229
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,560
I had no idea what they did so this
profile is an absolute mess with what I

230
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,029
put in it but I still managed to get
some people to endorse me how I just

231
00:14:12,029 --> 00:14:16,410
endorse them right and what made a bunch
of friends on linkedin endorse them and

232
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:19,890
I something to talk about later is this
whole idea of reciprocity right

233
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,490
I endorse them and they felt an
obligation to do something in return

234
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,589
so people are targeted and all three of
these people qualify for sort of younger

235
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:31,950
professionals that we're sort of just
starting out you know it looks like

236
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:35,910
maybe they would respect authority
they'd be like how this guy who says

237
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,329
he's got a PhD from the Colorado School
of Mines endorse me I'm a better say

238
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,320
something to him

239
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,640
so you can create expertise without
really knowing what you're doing

240
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,730
what's funny about this too is all over
social media people are warning you to

241
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,029
not fall for scam counts right for sock
puppet accounts

242
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:59,370
most of this advice is great for
identifying our buttering kids are the

243
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,560
guys that are out there just spraying
accounts hoping one of them survives if

244
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,660
you're creating a targeted account this
advice is much less useful

245
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,779
so you know one of the things people
always talk about is all do a reverse

246
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,810
image search a Google reverse image
search is great

247
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:19,890
it's not bulletproof there are fairly
easy ways to get around it but the

248
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:23,310
easiest way is if I'm doing a targeted
attack

249
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:25,650
we're going to use a real picture which
is what I did it was an authentic

250
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:30,300
picture it was you know it was a picture
of me it's like a show up anywhere else

251
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,560
on google image search

252
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,979
what's interesting is the quote on the
right where he's talking about going

253
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,470
through his contacts and bedding
everyone

254
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:40,800
that's a quote from somebody that's
still one of my contacts on linkedin

255
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,790
so I friend to him about two days before
he posted that he went through and

256
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:47,819
vetted his accounts and i'm still in
there

257
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,529
so clearly it's it's a process that you
know it's going to weed out some people

258
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,510
it's not obviously going to weed out the

259
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:00,930
dedicated attackers i can't i'm tempted
to to pitch a paper at some point about

260
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,420
cooling google reverse image search
because our ways to do with the

261
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,219
algorithms are not again not bulletproof
really meant for making images findable

262
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,220
not identifying thanks

263
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:21,120
cool so I want to talk a little bit of
credentials to again this is from Jerry

264
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,850
while and this is this is a real old
contact knee is if you need a letterhead

265
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,840
from someone you just send him a letter
asking for something stupid and back in

266
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,170
the day they'd send you a letter back
right

267
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,260
in this case again he was person
pretending he was representing the

268
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,830
German government so well is in Europe
he sent letters to Hitler in the brakes

269
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:44,100
brakes bank and they sent him back
letters and just copy the letterhead

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,220
so in today's world we have similar
credential needs people based a lot of

271
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,890
decisions on whether you've got the
proper credentials

272
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:58,110
I know lots of companies have photo ID
requirements for entering their facility

273
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:02,130
the problem is of those places that
require ID how many of them are properly

274
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:09,510
been trained to identify what a fake ID
looks like this is related to my fake

275
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,280
linkedin account I got busted

276
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,160
they shot my account down saying they
want to guess why I made the same

277
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,060
mistake a lot of actual crooks make that
operational security

278
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,650
i logged into to sock puppet accounts
from the same IP address a flag both of

279
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,880
them and shut up now

280
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,600
damn they got me all right the send me a
message said your counts on highly

281
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,840
restricted your shut down all right so
you click through how do i get my

282
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,800
account back

283
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,070
oh you need to present photo credential
you need to present

284
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,419
photo ID government-issued photo ID all
right where do i presented I got to

285
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,960
bring it in y'all send us a picture of
sense the scan of the ID

286
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,060
all right which one you want I got lots
of ivy

287
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:52,620
I didn't think they'd actually accept
any of my bogus vendor IDs

288
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:56,159
so instead I went on the internet it's
been about ten minutes

289
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,129
I that's not me as much as it looks like
me

290
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:04,780
my my fake profile was supposed to be
from Wyoming so i did a google search on

291
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,060
wyoming driver's license

292
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,970
this is the first one that came up
that's their old version it's not the

293
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,910
real ID version of the Wyoming driver's
license

294
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:16,510
all they wanted was my picture and
signature on it they allowed me to block

295
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:17,650
everything else out

296
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:22,600
so I did I also you know I went for the
i'm super paranoid so I'm going to sign

297
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,560
again

298
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,800
yeah that's really hard to do when i'm
the one who made both ids right

299
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,250
they took that it took him like 10
minutes actually got the response I got

300
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:38,530
was a blank email from their support but
just had the person's name of my account

301
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:39,730
is on lock

302
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:42,940
so that was pretty trivial do again

303
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,900
that's a process asking for photo ID
it's going to catch your you're

304
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,910
buttering kids right people that are
better

305
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,750
sending out creating lots of bogus
profiles I'm concentrating on one

306
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,690
profile i get a real investment in it
i'm going to spend the time to make

307
00:18:55,690 --> 00:18:56,500
something up

308
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,830
I didn't have to pay fifty bucks to get
the fake Wyoming ID

309
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,760
I just had to go on the internet because
the fifty-dollar ID looks good in person

310
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:08,050
just about any piece of junk looks good
when it scanned a hundred and fifty DPI

311
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,960
and sent via email you can't even read

312
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,420
I didn't even have to that's not even
really photoshop that's paint

313
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:22,120
I took an like by hand copied letters
from elsewhere on the sample to make the

314
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,139
name I mean that's how bad that is it's
like the worst fake ID ever

315
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,470
you're always the maid - 72 years old
this is what the new wyoming state ID

316
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:37,900
looks like but again if you have a
process of control in place and the ppl

317
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,920
enforcing it

318
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,350
don't know how to actually enforce it
not a very effective control and we see

319
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,540
this all time and I can I go into a bar

320
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,840
I'm underage chances are they're going
to know what id looks like they're gonna

321
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,740
know how to bed it but if I walk into a
business that says yeah we require

322
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,790
government issued ID

323
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:57,760
how many of them know what a Wyoming
idea is supposed to look like I walk in

324
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,700
with a fake Wyoming idea they're going
to know what that's that looks like they

325
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,110
have access to the book

326
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:05,020
yeah there's a book that's published
every whatever it is every quarter that

327
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,870
shows you all the u.s. IDs all the world
IDs

328
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,620
it's awesome

329
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,280
all right i think i got about five
minutes left what's interesting is this

330
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,210
just came to light about a week ago
there was a dude in England that has

331
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:20,740
facebook account stolen all the all the
hacker did was all the scammer did was

332
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:23,830
send in a copy of his passport

333
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,689
well as badly scan copy of a document
that's difficult to forge but you know

334
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,010
when you when you scanned it

335
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:34,420
it's not hard for it anymore this is
just me getting my account back right

336
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,970
the last thing I think I'm gonna talk
about is trustworthy actions

337
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,150
the idea that you do something
trustworthy people trust you we sort of

338
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,040
talked about this already

339
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,760
a lot of cons employ this technique
where he will give a build up the

340
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,929
leading give a little bit of skin to the
victim before they they take his money

341
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:54,790
so you know one one way of doing this

342
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,240
that one technique for doing this in
face-to-face social engineering is you

343
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,210
know as you're approaching a gatekeeper
you do something is going to think

344
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,290
you're a good guy

345
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:05,590
hey I found this thing's in the parking
lot so we must lost it

346
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,330
you know let me let me give that to you
just it establishes you as your good guy

347
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,250
one other techniques i like to use is
when i'm going to do tailgating which is

348
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,550
a little different but doing Cael gating
is to keep keep it on me a token gift

349
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:25,270
card like a five-dollar starbucks gift
card that hasn't been scratched off

350
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,420
so somebody's about to slam the door in
your face or you decide you want to

351
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,390
catch up to someone and be like hey you
dropped this

352
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,080
yeah it looks like a feller out of your
pocket not mine looks like it's I don't

353
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,220
drink coffee you can have it

354
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:39,070
well by the time you're done with that
conversation you're probably the door

355
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:39,850
already

356
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:42,939
but you're also establishing you as like
hey you're a good guy you just gave me

357
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,870
five dollars that the the research
behind this which is interesting is some

358
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,939
research netherlands

359
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:53,440
security researchers one of a university
campus and they start asking ppl

360
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,450
security questions and one of the
questions was what your password right

361
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,690
well in addition to the questions they
were asking them they would give him

362
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,059
chocolate some of them they give me
chocolate after they ask all the

363
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:04,809
questions

364
00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:07,780
some of them they give him chocolate
before they ask me all the questions

365
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,960
well lo and behold the ones that gave
chocolate before were more likely answer

366
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,700
the password question

367
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,730
it doesn't even matter if that was true

368
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:18,160
like even if they gave him a bogus
answer this

369
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,700
still did something that they wouldn't
have otherwise done they felt obligated

370
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,500
to answer that question

371
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,290
even the answer that falsely it's like
they've created a sense of obligation

372
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:32,139
which you know you don't give a gift you
give an obligation so people feel

373
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,260
obligated to reciprocate because our
whole society is built on you know

374
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,350
reciprocating those those trust
relationships

375
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,709
I got a bunch of resources here all
upload the slides at some point if I

376
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,550
forget you know ping me on Twitter or
email or something all i'll send you the

377
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:47,950
resource list there's a bunch of cool
stuff in here

378
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,050
great resources if you like con artistry
and and close-up magic and just like

379
00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,500
weird crazy crap that's the I'm manual
trickery and deception that's an awesome

380
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,510
read by the way it's got a lot of cool
it's got a lot of cool weird like CIA

381
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,750
nineteen sixties kind of stuff in it but
it's also interesting read from

382
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:10,300
inception standpoint for more resources
and if you got any questions

383
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:14,649
I think the president up on time that
good

384
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,400
ok we have any questions

385
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:24,430
hey one is social engineering

386
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:32,800
um so I tailgate into a facility one
time and I went into sat down an office

387
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,930
started working i had a fake badge from
the actually a fake badge from a company

388
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,520
is the process of being merged so I
walked in and sat down started type and

389
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,639
was there for about 10 minutes and
somebody on the floor came in and was

390
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,600
like open the door and then close it
again walked out they came back a little

391
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,340
later we're like sorry but we weren't
sure who you are like I'm from this

392
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,240
company like I'm just here you know I'm
i work for and gave the name of like

393
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,340
somebody over at the other company

394
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,889
I'm just I'm just doing some work here
just checking out the market blah blah

395
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,750
blah ok no problem

396
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:07,210
we were going to we we had some is going
to use the stream and move somewhere

397
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,390
else like 45 minutes later they're still
did

398
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,690
45 minutes later they come back they're
like we have a better office for you

399
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:16,540
you know that this one doesn't have you
know what we want to move you to a

400
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,230
better office like so i moved a better
option since she comes back she's like

401
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,870
hey or market vice president would like
to talk to you

402
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,260
blah blah blah some it walk into his
office and we started chatting and again

403
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,430
this is where you have a little

404
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:31,450
the knowledge about stupid stuff because
he speak in generalities like what I

405
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:34,570
don't know anything about this but you
start saying things like yeah you know

406
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,250
what this merger going on I just

407
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,270
I you know I just checking out the area
doing a little bit of research trying to

408
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:43,810
see where we might have some
opportunities some synergies you know if

409
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:47,560
there's any kind of market overlaps in
like 20 minutes later dude still talking

410
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,590
to me about like what the market is like
they're like I don't know anything about

411
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,760
think maybe oh yeah we have this kind of
business and that kind of business I'm

412
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,620
like I don't care let me out of here man

413
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,070
you got time for lunch yeah we can go on
home and get a free lunch out of this

414
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,820
now - so it's funny because once people
think you belong

415
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,689
like you belong you can stay there as
long as you know you're you're now at

416
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,750
home can you come back all every day
that week they started making a coffee

417
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,920
when you come in

418
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,080
it's just crazy but yeah I mean I think
my biggest my biggest pet peeve is when

419
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,100
people have a requirement for state
issued ID but they don't teach people

420
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,620
how to how to identify it

421
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:27,639
you it's nine times out of 10 you come
in and they're like in each state issued

422
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,890
ID which they don't even say they're
just like you have ID

423
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:33,580
sometimes we'll take one of those fake
you know company ideas but and all they

424
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,699
do with it as they look at it and use it
to type your name into the computer

425
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,830
okay there you go like huh

426
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,750
I promise not to use it anyone else have
any questions

427
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,889
I really appreciate you tell ya

428
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:55,690
oh yeah with that you know actually so
this would be cool and be really cool

429
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,610
pitch like a panel of just like epic
failures in social engineering because

430
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:04,300
we do get busted all the time right and
some of them are hilarious

431
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:09,850
so when in one facility I had a fake
verizon badge and this particular one so

432
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,570
I make all my badges by hand i don't
have a badge maker actually make them so

433

i glue them to another kind of piece of
plastic

435
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,200
and then laminate them and usually
they're fine well this one was on the

436
