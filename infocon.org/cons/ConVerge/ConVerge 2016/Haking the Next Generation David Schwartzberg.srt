1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
we talked about hacking the next
generation and the cyber front here

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,599
so with that obviously has to come a
little bit of Star Trek and the card

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,490
face palm yes

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:16,830
you corny we get it and use the word
cyber so writers and getting a little

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,538
upset about that but I promise you they
won't be any more of the star trek kind

6
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,830
of me more references really just to
kind of get that out of the way but

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,959
forgot them

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,090
so my generation of attacking people

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,200
we can remember in order to do something
with computers

10
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,360
it had certain minimum requirements
those requirements for things like

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,890
reading those skills also included
typing patience and a lot of that's

12
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:51,030
changed

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,260
specifically because of things like
mobility and the consumerization of IT

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:01,920
there's a whole nother generation now
who don't have that requirement at all

15
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,430
night

16
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,170
- okay I want my -

17
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,640
is it okay to show you answered with
people I'm sorry what'd you say

18
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,229
yeah yeah

19
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:26,759
it's okay to share your password to
people so that's some Benny the

20
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:27,960
destroyer

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,408
he he got that nickname by giving
mommy's iphone a bath

22
00:01:34,409 --> 00:01:40,020
he thought it needed to be washed and
that was a 279 dollar lesson for mommy

23
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,420
but then he's also destroyed many other
things in the house and continues to do

24
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:53,909
so but a couple years ago he barely
spoke just very few words and when you

25
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,130
got a tablet and started using it and
then sort of verbalizing his pass code

26
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,979
it took about a good year and some few
extra months before we kind of like

27
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:07,710
retrain him on

28
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,970
why that's really not a good idea

29
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,320
the no 1492 big deal there's nothing on
there is a kids tablets

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:22,090
you know youtube for kids and some games
and stuff but there is really a much

31
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,290
deeper problem where parents are sharing
their mobile devices with their kids and

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,429
could be a corporate own device or even
if it's a BYOD enabled device

33
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:36,250
there are many types of sense of data on
that device there can email documents

34
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,750
with having the applications and they
hand it off to their kids because it's

35
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:47,200
become the electronic babysitter and and
because of that low bar to entry for

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,820
kids to be able to use these devices we
created a new pack for kids and a part

37
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,299
of that

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,830
it's really kind of an incentive based
program to teach kids cybersecurity

39
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:07,150
Internet safety and best practices as
well as stem part of like when I grew up

40
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,150
and I played Dungeons and Dragons

41
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:19,420
right on i would spend hours memorizing
the the tables and the matrices because

42
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,220
it made the game play that much better

43
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,390
we had kind of pause and look things up
it's slow the game down and made it less

44
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:27,190
interesting less exciting

45
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,180
there was an incentive and that's what
we do it had four kids we provide some

46
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,430
kind of incentive for them to want to
learn really complex technology

47
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,600
I mean mobile devices are pretty easy to
use but behind it is a lot of complexity

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:45,040
and i'll explain a bit more about how
we're hacking the next generation

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,109
through hack for kids but before you
know when do we come up with this idea

50
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,900
to create hack for kids

51
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,190
so back in early 2013

52
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,350
I saw your tweet by some hope you see
there i was getting washed out by the

53
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,130
light

54
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,799
what they wanted to have a kids based
conference in Chicago have to see that I

55
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,350
was like this is awesome

56
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,829
since then i published a book for kids

57
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:19,989
I've been active with my kids teaching
them technology and scouting and it

58
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:22,089
seemed like this was my calling

59
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,409
inside of me was this

60
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,350
kind of Ember spark it was just kind of
smoldering and this kind of started to

61
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:35,020
fan it a little bit and I contacted them
and said hey you know I'd love to help

62
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,490
out in any way

63
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:39,760
there's a really early stage want to
jump in i didn't want to do any kind of

64
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,590
leadership or anything I just wanted to
be there to help and they were like sure

65
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,590
so thrilled so now that ember is
smoldering and it's starting to get

66
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:53,830
bigger and hotter and then the board of
thought on decided they didn't want to

67
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:58,000
do a kid's event which was perfectly
fine because it was being really kind of

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,160
run by some people from the thought on
board and then all of that like

69
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,210
excitement because we already had a
couple calls we started the plan all

70
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:13,270
went away and then it's kind of like aa
glum head and while just kind of you

71
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,299
know doing my day-to-day stuff in 2014

72
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,530
you know we launched their first half
for kids thought about it

73
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,940
what to do how to do it who to do with
never ran a conference before I've done

74
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:29,920
other types of organizational activities
but never actually ran a conference and

75
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,680
not knowing what's involved with that

76
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:40,030
so work with some other folks and we had
a good showing about 40 kids total of

77
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,650
about a hundred and six people including
pan parents the kids

78
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,960
volunteers everyone you can see here on
this just kind of some opening comments

79
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,440
and one of the staff is really busy on
his mobile device which really kind of

80
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,230
tells you the the ear that we live in

81
00:05:56,230 --> 00:06:01,630
because mobility is everything nowadays
I work for mobile company site feel like

82
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:08,980
personally a constant basis but we we
have a pretty broad age range we have

83
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:12,250
kids that are we first were eight to 17

84
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,620
because we wanted to give high school
students an opportunity to learn more

85
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,410
about technology they're probably doing
it already but they might wanna have

86
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:21,280
done something with ethical hacking and
we want to make that available to them

87
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,840
but also we have any is there and he saw
this homemade hack of some guy took a

88
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,700
galvanized steel garbage and and he
turned it into a robot

89
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,870
put like some more tea what do I see
that and all ok

90
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:39,910
arduino controllers and then you look at
this thing it was bigger than him but

91
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:45,550
his incentive I don't you can see it on
the left is a clear bucket of candy so

92
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:49,630
that helped me overcome this fear
through the incentive of something sweet

93
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,520
but we have changed to seven to 17
because we found out that some kids were

94
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,200
being homeschooled

95
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,469
actually we're kind of going into the
third grade they sometimes are a little

96
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,880
bit more head of public school systems
and or private school systems and we

97
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,500
wanted to open it up to them

98
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,160
we also do things with like you know I
trouble either snap circuits and if

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,420
you're familiar with them

100
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,840
there are a lot of fun i'll tell you
more about them a bit

101
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,229
we also did some stuff with 3d printing
last year and this one actually was kind

102
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:17,980
of cool

103
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,450
a lot of the ideas I wish I could take
credit for it is really coming from my

104
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,900
kids and my kids friends one of them

105
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,780
mom we've got an arduino showing the
blinky light and my son was like well

106
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,590
it's kind of cold blink and you make a
blink Morse code is right there

107
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:40,539
raising the bar on that yeah sure so it
took him to set through it started to

108
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:45,700
create different types of functions for
. - and then the alphabet making it

109
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,930
easier to read and he was learning the
whole like how basic programming works

110
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,020
which you've never really been exposed
to before and that kind of got it

111
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,370
I'm excited and then we started to put
messages and was very clear to read SOS

112
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,210
or whatever and one of his friends said
well can we do a scavenger hunt

113
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:07,780
so we do is we marry those two ideas of
the arduino blinking Morse code but it

114
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:10,479
was also a part of a scavenger hunt

115
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:17,080
so we made some little hack of nine-volt
battery connectors for the Arduinos put

116
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,280
them in some 3d printed cases and then
kind of him throughout the event and

117
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,239
then to go find you know the blinking
light and then we have a sheet and they

118
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,090
had a scavenger hunt which they had a
great time doing they were running all

119
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:28,929
over the place

120
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,960
taking selfies with the different things
that we had hidden in the venue which

121
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,100
they got from the Arduinos those are
some kind of fun things

122
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,009
who here knows morse code like knows it
not knows of it

123
00:08:41,578 --> 00:08:45,779
yeah like I know about five or six
letters right it's it's kind of lost

124
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:46,740
skill

125
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,160
unless you've been in the military and
the kinda banged it into you and it's

126
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,769
their most people don't know it

127
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,529
and most of the kids nowadays don't know
of it which is the reason why we

128
00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:56,519
introduced it

129
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,699
this one here is pretty fun

130
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:03,359
one of our volunteers on one of our
calls which is trying to against

131
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,439
brainstorm for some other ideas and she
said well I like to go to goodwill and

132
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:14,250
get really inexpensive old tech give it
to her son and you haven't taken apart

133
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,519
because he started taking apart things
in their house

134
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,730
so before he got to the microwave she
thought it would be a good idea to

135
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,649
here's a router

136
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:27,120
here's a telephone has a remote control
here's an old radio and it's a low cost

137
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,540
investment but the education is very
high because now they're seeing

138
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,230
not this little piece of magic
electronics that just kind of does

139
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,250
something but they're seeing how its put
together inside there

140
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:42,899
the magic kind of goes away but the
curiosity level rises up very high so

141
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:46,500
here are one of the tyros which is what
we call the kids that attend attack a

142
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,269
hack for kids event

143
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,649
she's taking apart some tech it looks
like an old router or something like

144
00:09:52,649 --> 00:09:53,540
that

145
00:09:53,540 --> 00:10:00,560
kinda you sure but yeah they love it
they love taking the techno party an

146
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,349
idea we all thought would be okay

147
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,230
you know we don't know how it's going to
be received it's one of our most popular

148
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,820
activities

149
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,579
so now what exactly is the entity of
hacker kit so you kind of understand you

150
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,449
kind of how we came about but what is it

151
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:21,949
it is a public charity to 501 c 3
charity registered with the IRS so um

152
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:27,050
you know putting the event together it's
a big challenge but it takes funds so

153
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:32,209
you know you feel compelled you like I
just got this thousand dollar bonus

154
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,079
check from work

155
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,439
I just don't know what to do with it i'm
gonna donate it to hack for kid

156
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,180
we appreciate that thank you but reality
is whatever you want to donate that's

157
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,839
fine

158
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,500
and we work with other organizations
that are very very helpful like even the

159
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:50,600
folks here at converging and besides
Detroit hugely helpful in providing

160
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,350
venue and in donating the space and
other things in order for us to be able

161
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:57,860
to do this and we work with other
organizations at the partnership and

162
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,139
it's easy to do that as a charity and it
also kind of projects are intent we're

163
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:08,690
not looking to make money in inhale
commercialize or capitalize on this

164
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:12,680
stuff we really are just promoting
education that's really worried about

165
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:17,959
we've partnered with other events like
circle city con if you are in

166
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:19,099
Indianapolis

167
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,720
about a month ago we had a village
they're kind of like we're going to do

168
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,279
here tomorrow

169
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,699
we also their big part of ours were also
doing a second one across the pond in

170
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,899
Belgium with the folks of rhukaan which
is actually pretty cool and they really

171
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,899
adopted a model we're looking for work

172
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,350
we go in we educate them we enable them
let them know kind of what would work

173
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:48,110
and what wouldn't work and how to work
with the kids and then they kind of took

174
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:53,149
the effort initiated or they're like
already have like a long list of

175
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:57,439
different things they want to do some of
them little far-reaching but others like

176
00:11:57,439 --> 00:11:59,089
look really possible

177
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,470
and we love that because the only way to
scale this is for other folks that are

178
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:09,379
experienced organizers to want to be
able to have an event like this with

179
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:14,240
their event and actually that kind of
that symbiotic relationship between an

180
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,699
established event and a hacker kids
village or another day dedicated has

181
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,990
been a really successful model kind of
Chicago's like the only one where we

182
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:26,959
actually have just a day who would you
have for kids

183
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:33,589
everything else has been a partnership
including York on appointing to Chris if

184
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:37,970
you have not been a jerk on you really
should be completed cara con not just

185
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,379
because you're in the room

186
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:46,040
it's probably one of the events that i
think i can say i've been to every

187
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,870
single one and I've never missed a
single gurkot a lot goes on there but

188
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,139
we've partnered and i think i actually
nagged you for a couple years for some

189
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:59,389
emails about when you're gonna do kids
event even before we advocate and then

190
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:04,370
he finally he gave in and we had our
first one last year and it was it was

191
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:09,350
very successful me he gave us plenty of
space actually almost fifty percent

192
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,399
larger than the room where now and we
had a lot going on a lot of and even

193
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,639
people that are speaking here and people
are volunteering here and people that

194
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,860
are organizing we're helping us

195
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,889
so you can see this big community
pulling together because we all believe

196
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:22,730
in the mission

197
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:27,410
so definitely tomorrow we're doing a
happy kid to converge and / besides

198
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:31,490
Detroit by now

199
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:35,660
I don't know if you kind of feel that
ember inside of you and you're like hey

200
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,550
I want to do one of these two or hey I
know someone that runs an event in

201
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,719
another city

202
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:46,759
maybe they can do one well we are
looking for people who kind of have that

203
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:49,699
ember in them there's a Google Form
don't bother writing it down this

204
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:54,439
present is available online you can just
click on the link from there to fill out

205
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,370
the form

206
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,850
get in touch with us and we can figure
something out there is a lot of people

207
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:05,240
that come up to us and say we want to do
an event in their City find when you get

208
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,600
back to you and that kind of ends the
conversation unfortunately

209
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,470
so kind of having that information in
advance when do you want to do it where

210
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,880
do you want to do it

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,449
what other event do you want to do with
in conjunction on the same day or

212
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:20,449
another day is very helpful information
up front

213
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:26,600
um forgot to tell the joke before the
punch line

214
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,410
we take security and had four kids very
seriously because one of my kids playing

215
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,490
a video game and I put a little joke
behind it but it actually is one of the

216
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,990
things that we take very very seriously
but we do a fairly good job of kind of

217
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,259
just integrating it not making it so
obvious it's not like you're walking

218
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:52,310
through TSA and make whatever jokes you
want it's an obvious thing you're going

219
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,630
through a metal detector

220
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:59,899
but because of you know the nature of
kids and risk and all the risk that

221
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,259
comes with you know creeps out there

222
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:07,880
oh you know my kids go I want to make
sure my kids are say I know chris's kids

223
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,180
go

224
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,870
I want to make sure he's getting
everybody else's kids are safe so some

225
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,899
of the things that we've adopted because
I'm I don't know the term Scouter it

226
00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,019
means an adult leader in boy scouts of
america program

227
00:15:18,589 --> 00:15:23,779
I'm a Scouter now for about five years
so I adopted some of the practices from

228
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:30,769
the BSA and one of them is we never have
one adult in the room with one or more

229
00:15:30,769 --> 00:15:35,930
kids there's always going to be at least
two adults and has a variety of reasons

230
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:39,949
it's not just to protect the kids if
it's to protect the adults right

231
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:46,160
never we don't want anyone ever to have
to defend their character even know

232
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,339
they're there to help and we want to
make sure everybody has a good time and

233
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:55,370
everybody learns so we don't take
volunteers off the street either so you

234
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,670
come up to me after this and you're like
hey I want to volunteer

235
00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:02,899
I get emails from people i want to
volunteer and even some people in this

236
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:08,660
room right now they've asked me like how
do you know how can I bet you do you do

237
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,139
something with scouting because i know i
have to do training with them every two

238
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,939
years it's a requirement

239
00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:17,389
I've done stuff with is C squared is a
partner of ours and they do background

240
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:20,720
checks especially for the safe and
secure online presentation

241
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,920
there's other things like with athletics
if you're a coach in your say soccer

242
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,639
coach

243
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,059
they make you go through training they
do background checks if i can get a

244
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:31,670
letter or something that states

245
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:36,199
you're you're safe to be around kids you
know we still accept that with a grain

246
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:41,420
of salt just I have a lack of trusting
nature but if you know if you know

247
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,959
somebody on the board of directors and
you know them more than like hey you

248
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,138
know I met Bob at this conference and I
see Bob every year past three years

249
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,490
Bob's a good guy

250
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:57,410
that's not enough you need to know the
person we also take photography very

251
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,639
very seriously

252
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:04,250
I'm sorry with the my keep moving and
keep moving the audio but what i mean by

253
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:10,819
that is we state before the event like
during the opening comments if you want

254
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:13,250
to take a picture of your tyro

255
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:17,599
and there's another tyro in the frame
politely ask them they can you either

256
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,770
you wait or you ask them to hate and you
screwed over her second I wanna take a

257
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,359
picture of my kid and um you'll keep
them out of it and it was going to post

258
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,349
the social media

259
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,649
we don't want people posting other
people's kids online because maybe that

260
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,909
parent doesn't want their kids for the
online for it only they can do it here

261
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:38,899
on one of our photographers that one
staff they're instructed that if they

262
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:44,959
take a picture that's front-facing only
I keep control of those anything that

263
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,549
gets public like this would be something
that's from like a side shot or that

264
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,120
when you can't really identify like I
don't know who this is i honestly don't

265
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,629
know this kid but you know he's doing
something there

266
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,919
he's playing with some snap circuits
he's shooting a propeller into the air

267
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:06,110
the arduino scavenger hunt boxes there
he might have been working with that

268
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:10,370
and so we know but this the picture
tells you a lot about what we do but no

269
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,678
identity is being revealed

270
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:17,509
and in photography even extends into the
restroom to tell people you know what

271
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,320
put your phone away Carrie business

272
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,009
don't take it out when you're in the
restroom male or female

273
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,460
doesn't matter and if somebody of the
kids in there by themselves

274
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,669
turn around and leave wait for them to
exit

275
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,119
we always want that two to one ratio to
adults 21 kid

276
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,959
and even if you're on your phone just
like having an awesome time and had four

277
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,429
kids and tweaking it out there

278
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:43,369
you don't need to do that in the
restroom somebody else might think

279
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:46,220
you're doing something that you're not
and again you have to defend your

280
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,059
character

281
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,570
we have to confiscate your phone make
sure we delete pictures and even then

282
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,720
forensically could be recovered with all
of that we don't want to do that

283
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,908
we want people to have fun here's
another example like there's a picture

284
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:01,909
of a tyro gender

285
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:05,480
I don't know I actually do know this kid

286
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,659
gender is unknown so these are the kind
of photography that we use all you see

287
00:19:08,659 --> 00:19:15,110
is there's like a big hairy arm so I'm
assuming that's pateros dad and they're

288
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:17,719
putting something together in the
building something

289
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,200
last year

290
00:19:22,249 --> 00:19:26,720
I'll get this and last year we want to
do that first year we had paper badges

291
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,700
kind of first-year try to figure it all
out quick and easy last year i think it

292
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:37,820
was about 370 some odd hours of 3d
printing in my bedroom while trying to

293
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:42,470
produce a couple hundred i think of
printers about 250 badges and different

294
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,590
colors so yeah a lot of noise at night

295
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:49,428
each page took about 15 minutes the
print 58 minutes to pray excuse me

296
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:56,480
yeah there they were not like ninety
percent solid but they were you know

297
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,990
pretty solid because we want to make
sure that they were durable especially

298
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,340
the clip we don't want the tops to break
off but and they were reasonably thick I

299
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,480
mean they're probably about that big and
we made different ones for different

300
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,960
locations so when we went to Kirk on
there was one that's a dirt on when we

301
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,710
were broke on said Luke on we try to
really customize and spent a lot of time

302
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,549
doing this

303
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:20,059
you can see the gliders on there and
then this other symbol like the arrow

304
00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:21,860
pointing down actually

305
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,889
we created a simple called the tyro
symbol for them

306
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,610
so this way like the badge it was
pointing down but when they held it up

307
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:32,149
it was facing proper direction for them
to be able to see it when they pick it

308
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:37,160
up with the tire symbol is is that arrow
is on

309
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,690
if you ever seen the Nordic runes
there's one symbols like an arrow called

310
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,440
the tire

311
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,870
tyr and the circle completes the word
tyro with the circle also and all the

312
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:53,719
tire symbol is like strength and warrior
and then the circle is representing the

313
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,630
unity of the hacker community

314
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:01,820
don't laugh Chris and yeah and the
hackers never ending

315
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:05,750
I first request or question knowledge
like once we figure something out and

316
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,590
you're like oh cool i change it like you
keep changing it pushing it further we

317
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,879
don't stop

318
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:21,080
so that's their symbol why and where had
four kids so why there are other events

319
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:21,620
out there

320
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,489
this was not a unique idea there are
other great events out there i should

321
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:30,530
say like roots asylum formerly known as
def con kids and there's also on their

322
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:35,899
weather was hack hit out of san jose and
what they both have in common is a very

323
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,190
west coast base

324
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,780
I live in Chicago originally from the
east coast but I've also met a lot of

325
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,830
friends in the info tech community in
the northern Midwest as you can see it's

326
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,340
a pretty big community there's a lot of
folks it's also pretty small community a

327
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,480
lot of people know each other and in
because of that we were able to have

328
00:21:53,480 --> 00:22:02,660
events in places like Chicago and grand
rapids and now Detroit and Indianapolis

329
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:07,220
so we're really kind of looking at this
bit more globally at least northern

330
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,669
hemisphere and in the end even root ,
but now if you can see sect or you know

331
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:17,179
we got the green light on going to
canada which is actually pretty cool as

332
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:20,900
i know some people over there and have
been very excited about or very eager to

333
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,530
go to Canada to do a hacker kids and now
we're doing it in conjunction with

334
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,950
b-sides toronto and Sektor which is
phenomenal

335
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,220
we're hoping that's going to be a really
nice huge event but you know we

336
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,260
go to other places we want to do more
but it's hard to scale so we need to

337
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:43,520
find the right people in the right
places to do this we want to get further

338
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,020
south in this country we speak when
spoken to people in Atlanta and Dallas

339
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,299
and Raleigh and again just it doesn't
always pan out

340
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,918
it takes a time investment on both sides
they want to do it but they got also

341
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,380
getting involved in help

342
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:08,090
so and move on so some of the things
that we do we have a three types of

343
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,149
activities we have a speaker track

344
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:18,590
we have activity stations and we have
workshops now activity stations are

345
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,100
really designed to be 15 to 20 minutes
or more

346
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,668
they want to be there longer but to
teach them something they haven't done

347
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:26,990
before

348
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,280
give him some exercises give them some
challenges and if they've done it before

349
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,240
kind of take it to the next level
especially with some of the older Tyros

350
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,860
but if it's not something of their
interests that we did a a Python for

351
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:44,449
kids activity station and they might go
in there or their parents might kind of

352
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,620
push them in there in that conference
room and now they're like oh

353
00:23:49,429 --> 00:23:53,480
coding is really not for me i like
hardware so this year we can came up

354
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,549
with a hardware badge which is actually
pretty cool

355
00:23:55,549 --> 00:24:02,059
the hardware it was pre assembled but
it's fully habitable and inside of it is

356
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:06,860
like an 80 tiny which they can treat it
like an arduino with the breakout pins

357
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,939
and drop the sketch on there and run it
which is actually very cool and some of

358
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,480
them with the help of the the vonage
manufacturer was able to change the

359
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,390
badges or change some of the stuff that
like the speed of the the encoded

360
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,450
message because each one of them has a
different try to see each one of a

361
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:26,299
different color has a different coded
message on

362
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,570
so it was actually pretty fun and you
can see the pretty badass

363
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,520
and then you could even like adults are
like the parents got one too

364
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,850
they were like loving it and you can go
back home because a lot of the parents

365
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:42,199
that come to these events are ITR
infosec people there are few accounts

366
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,480
and and and you know just stay at home
moms and whatnot but

367
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,600
the detect people were just like
salivating

368
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:53,710
because this is just a fun thing you
can't go and pick up at best buy or buy

369
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,780
anywhere else is very very custom but
yeah we we did that

370
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:01,178
i'm going to talk about that a little
bit when we were talking about the badge

371
00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:05,380
with the workshops so you know the
activity so i would throw out the Python

372
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,730
for kids workshop

373
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,299
some of the kids loved it some of the
kids just did a little bit and moved on

374
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,370
so that's kind of really what we do we
had one kids sit there all day and

375
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,979
Indianapolis doing crypto challenges

376
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,929
he never did crypto before in his life
he discovered how to like decode binary

377
00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:27,640
and base64 and wrote 13 and then we even
had some other ones with like you know

378
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,750
or bash

379
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:32,890
raise your hand if you know what are
benches it's okay all right

380
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:35,890
it's the language of Star Wars so the
very first Star Wars movie

381
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:42,040
yes yes i know i'm with you you should
know that I'm sorry so yeah you have to

382
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,510
leave now

383
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:47,799
so in the very first Star Wars movie
little history um you can see unlike

384
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:50,950
their display in the x-wing just some
characters that came up that was

385
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:54,490
completely meaningless was all random
and then somebody actually created the

386
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:59,080
armor visual language that could be
converted to like a ski and then

387
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,299
somebody has a website where you can
type in english and it converts into

388
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,020
orbit

389
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,110
so we had a challenge that was orbiting
the kid look at it goes

390
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,520
that's from Star Wars and he kinda
worked out from them spent the entire

391
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,010
day just working on all these challenges
and that's great him his dad you know

392
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,490
he's like I am I son have fun and
everything wrote this long email on how

393
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:27,100
he impressed us because he found
something inside himself that he didn't

394
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,709
know he had it with a passion for
mathematics or more advanced mathematics

395
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:36,130
and you know he didn't really commit
like how many you kids how many folks

396
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:38,740
out there have kids that tell you
everything about what they've done and

397
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,290
communicate yeah had a really great time
today and we did all this stuff with

398
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:44,530
advancement know you ask you what you do
today it's one nothing

399
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:48,610
and that's the end of the conversation
unless you push them a little harder but

400
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,840
and you know that his dad was very happy
to get the kind of feedback and now he

401
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,959
knows that something that he should be
able to support with the Sun when it

402
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,530
came to Chicago we had more challenges
for and he's come back he's been at

403
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:02,740
least we had four kids now he's about 15

404
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:10,570
he loved so workshops are kind of like
an extended version of that so i can

405
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:12,159
give you a raspberry pi

406
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,460
I could show you how to log on to it i
can give you a Python script

407
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,129
I can make you turn a servomotor but
when you're done looking at that and you

408
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:25,330
really have no other interest you kind
of move on but if you have an interest

409
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,879
what we've done is like a whole unboxing
workshop / it was about three hours on

410
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,610
Raspberry Pi from taking it apart

411
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,510
no hdmi monitor no USB keyboard

412
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,970
you have to figure out what your IP
address was so you can xrdp onto the

413
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,840
device and the kids had to get into a
router and we we take this for granted

414
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:52,629
but they've never done it before and now
they're like wow this is pretty cool and

415
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,900
they were on there and they did all that
stuff i just described in this workshop

416
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,900
instructor was teaching them

417
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:03,220
web application pending but we called it

418
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,200
web hacking exposed the bounty hunter
edition threw up a copy of Boba Fett

419
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:11,860
sold out there is no more space in that
workshop

420
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,310
it's how you package it we have other
things like spider-man but if we say hey

421
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:21,010
you want to do some advanced
mathematical cryptography

422
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:24,100
you're not gonna have anyone sit down at
the table when you put a sign on the

423
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,649
wall of his spy math they're either
they're all day so

424
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:33,740
tops of the workshops are really more
like two to three hours sometimes for

425
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:38,420
and we always do a safe and secure
online presentation because that's where

426
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:44,120
we're teaching anti cyberbullying ethics
and Internet safety and best practices

427
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,330
all the other stuff like you know
there's some cyber security and it but

428
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:50,330
everything else we're doing is really
around stem and ethical hacking

429
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,830
so we make sure that this is a part of
the program now I'm the speaking talks

430
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,449
with speaking track

431
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:03,170
not every location has one is it's
really kind of sometimes difficult if

432
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,380
you're running a very like an adult
conference to fill of speaking track

433
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:11,000
will call quality speakers when it's
it's kids we want a lot of kids to speak

434
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,590
we don't have any age discrimination you
know it doesn't have to be kids we do

435
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:21,350
encourage kids we have a mentor program
but the that you know anyone that wants

436
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:25,429
to speak on something but it has to be
age-appropriate we had something to talk

437
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:30,080
about biohacking in Chicago but she came
in there and she had a nice display

438
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:35,120
she had on phosphorus and bacteria and
then when she kind of covered in a black

439
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,899
box

440
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:40,820
it was like hack for kids and bacteria
which was actually cool then smell very

441
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,010
good in there but it was actually pretty
cool

442
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:47,960
that's no good at all but that's kind of
what we're talking about so if you want

443
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,270
to talk about something really advanced
and interesting like that but you can

444
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:55,400
bring it down the level we're happy to
have you there is a speaker last year

445
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,450
this is ruben call i don't know if you
heard of them he's actually been pretty

446
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:04,280
pretty active as a keynote speaker at
the age of nine and CEOs own company

447
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,750
I think he's now going into 4th grade
maybe fifth grade

448
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:12,620
he spoke there he is our first keynote
we were very happy to have them

449
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,459
anybody really talked about during the
keynote is in order to be a really good

450
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,780
whitehat security professional you need
to learn the Black Arts and he put it in

451
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,930
the context of Star Wars apropos for me
and it was well received because they're

452
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:30,470
looking at this guy I mean they were
like teenagers use me they were

453
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:35,540
teenagers in the audience watching a
nine-year-old present to them about

454
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,520
cybersecurity

455
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,129
so in that

456
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:44,110
kinda invokes this kind of enthusiasm
that they may have may not have had

457
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:48,040
before they might have a curiosity but
this really kind of get some going in

458
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:51,280
there like he can do this I can do this

459
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:56,530
and along the same thing out of you guys
ever heard of austin Valesky he was our

460
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,620
keynote in Chicago this year you know I
never really heard of him either but if

461
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,610
you ever play the game

462
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:06,040
impossible rush couple years ago it was
like the number 16 most popular game in

463
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,170
the Apple I of App Store

464
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:11,740
he and another teenager without pain

465
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,510
14 to 15 when he created it they just
saturday afternoon the other kids cinema

466
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,640
video here's an idea for a game

467
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,450
Austen wrote the code published it
within a month

468
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,590
a hundred thousand downloads some
marketing company came up to them

469
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:32,650
we want to buy this from you so he's
most adults would like dream of that but

470
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:37,510
for teenager it's kinda gobsmacking
because you just don't expect it and you

471
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:40,720
kind of excited that people are using
your app but then when someone wants to

472
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,220
buy it you're like what we do is you
don't have to negotiate that has stuff

473
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,760
and then once it was in the hands of the
marketing company

474
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,820
it took off and since then

475
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:54,879
you know I think Austin is now 16

476
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,880
he's still in high school and he gets
like consulting jobs for web UI design

477
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,670
he flies to Israel he's been flown out
to google and apple headquarters and he

478
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,820
gives keynote presentation is not just
for us that's how I met him he was at

479
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:15,730
some other student and technology event
in illinois and like this kid is awesome

480
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:20,050
so the idea behind having him present is
not just because it was awesome it was a

481
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,580
really nice polite

482
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:29,110
kitty was like very cool very cool kit
just hearing his presentation I wanted

483
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:35,169
to make I OS apps and I've done a few
little hacks here and there but like I'm

484
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,040
like god this is all I want to do this
if you could do this I can do this

485
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,270
so then I like to put myself in other
people's shoes and go would have fun

486
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:46,690
like a ten-year-old watching this
presentation because they were 10 year

487
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,450
olds a lot of middle school hit

488
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:54,900
11 12 and what if they wanted to learn
how to make an Iowa SAT but they go home

489
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,770
the parent ones windows you can't run
xcode on Windows you can try to make a

490
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:04,410
hackintosh but it doesn't always work

491
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:09,750
you're really not too many choices and
all of that inspiration and passion just

492
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,630
kind of flies away and then they get
bummed out and computer stop until they

493
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:23,010
decide to play clash royale or something
but or pokemon go then they want to make

494
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:26,640
an appt again but they don't know how to
and their parents don't know how to do

495
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,590
what we did this year in Chicago is
Austin gave his talk in the morning and

496
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,429
then after lunch he did to our workshop
on how to just build a calculator app

497
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,170
you have to start somewhere

498
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,390
but they loved it because it really kind
of reinforced what he talked about it

499
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,460
gave them an opportunity to learn and it
was very well received

500
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,000
so that's kind of some of the stuff we
do we like to talk about and then do it

501
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,830
how many times you guys go to a con

502
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:56,399
you watch somebody talk about a tour so
I can't want to use it and you never

503
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,710
really do i know that happens to me
every kind of it so we want to be able

504
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:04,380
to give the kids the opportunity to do
that we do that also in Chicago every

505
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,149
year activity

506
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:10,299
station a debriefing on this here

507
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:15,819
it was a stem project to build a
catapult out of popsicle sticks glue gun

508
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:19,389
paper plastic spoon and rubber bands and
all we gave them with a picture

509
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:25,299
no step by step instructions here's a
picture and some of it had some build

510
00:34:25,299 --> 00:34:29,649
challenges which were kinda obvious
created by the back of the picture

511
00:34:29,649 --> 00:34:31,808
because you couldn't see couldn't rotate
it

512
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:35,740
it's just two dimensional and they had
to figure some of that out like if i

513
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:40,178
glue the crossbars on how do I wrap the
rubber band around the crossbar and

514
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,349
attach a spoon if it's already glued two
posts they have to figure that out first

515
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:48,339
and then glued a piece on but not all of
them did but that's okay you can still

516
00:34:48,339 --> 00:34:53,859
kind of get around it and what i thought
was really awesome was a lot of them

517
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:59,828
built their project and then had
competitions on who could send like a

518
00:34:59,829 --> 00:35:00,940
ball of paper

519
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:05,410
the furthest and then they would tweet
their project a little better to have it

520
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:10,390
send something further now while that
sounds very academic like very base line

521
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:18,609
what are we teaching them teaching how
to build like a little RND test and then

522
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,058
go back and do a little more R&D and
that's what engineering is about it's

523
00:35:22,059 --> 00:35:25,510
not your building and works the first
time you know you go through Lego kit

524
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:30,039
who's ever built a lego the first time a
complicated lego project and they didn't

525
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:32,710
get like a piece backwards you have like
reverse it

526
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,180
very few people but this is much more
complicated and a lot of them did a very

527
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,350
good job and they had fun with it to
others

528
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,360
that's the stem station and because of
the scouting party i'm also uh uh no the

529
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,080
stem / program it's just part of
scouting another way to have more stem

530
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,069
involved with scouting just the kids did
the project and they get some credit

531
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,780
towards that

532
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,560
but this is what that looks like
workshops talk about that Python for

533
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,950
kids and before you saying hey isn't
that early copy written by no starch

534
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:12,060
press their sponsor of ours and a
supporter and I did get written approval

535
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:13,140
to use that arrow

536
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,400
so yes I follow the law I'm by the way I
don't really do an introduction of

537
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,870
myself during this talk but my
background is not only a 19 infosec but

538
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:26,520
it's also counting and a little bit of
law so i usually kind of check things

539
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,630
out make sure everything's above board
before I do it because I don't like the

540
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,050
fallout I like to keep everything like
to sleep peacefully at night

541
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,430
so here on we do the Python for kids and
we took some these exercises right out

542
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,540
of the book because we have the books we
give them away as prizes but we wanted

543
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,860
to just begin with basic stuff there's
hello world and some lists and just

544
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,550
doing basic input like what's your name
and printing it out just very very

545
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,900
rudimentary things and then we started
to give them challenges like the dizzy

546
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:59,280
turtle basically a for loop just to kind
of go around and draw it but then they

547
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,600
changed the speed or they try to do
different things that were fun which is

548
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:09,779
cool and then the favorites kind of
build two lists and merge them and then

549
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:11,670
Fibonacci series

550
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:17,070
that's hard for some adults but um we we
put that in there just to see if there's

551
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:20,250
anyone a bit more advanced they really
wanted to kind of push themselves and

552
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,780
create that algorithm

553
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,480
so what

554
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,530
do you look a little paltry we we have a
library online on our website

555
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:36,330
h4 k.b kiidz com go to libraries a lot
of this stuff that I talked about we try

556
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,350
to get it up there

557
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:42,509
we have like we had the first year how
to build a minecraft server we wanted to

558
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,940
teach them linux and they wanted to play
minecraft

559
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:51,660
boom bring a vm or vm host spun up about
13 guests have their own box

560
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:54,690
they built the minecraft server and they
played Minecraft when they were done

561
00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:00,000
those notes are right there you can that
link still works all the instructions

562
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:00,990
are still current

563
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,479
and you can your kids have like a vm in
the cloud running linux whatever

564
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,070
cento is about to have them build a long
arm minecraft server each of them to

565
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,050
install java you know fun stuff like
that and all the crypto challenge not

566
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:19,740
all oak a lot of the crypto challenges
they're just images so they click a link

567
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,069
will have the image do that
intentionally because i don't want to

568
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:28,980
just be able to copy base 64 and drop it
in the decoder one of the appetite and

569
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,240
write or type it out in some presents so
we need to update some of what we've

570
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:41,759
been doing the shooter part of the
incentive product borrow the idea of we

571
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,260
talked about incentives earlier have
them do things reward them rcts is

572
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,640
really participatory based and as long
as they're doing a lot more activities

573
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,960
they receive an opportunity to win a
prize at the draw in a drawing at the

574
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,070
end of the day

575
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,100
so for example we just kind of like a
little hacker his business card hole

576
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,970
punch it

577
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:03,689
whenever is teaching them something
about a raspberry pi or snap circuits or

578
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:09,090
whatever and then that's the number of
drawings they get and have a private

579
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:14,160
python script that puts like you know
Bob 66 chances and then it goes and

580
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,399
randomly grab them and everybody gets a
chance to win once

581
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,680
so this snap circuit kit was donated by
the company called alinco that created

582
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,640
snap circuits fortunately they're nearby
there in Wheeling Illinois which is very

583
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,850
close to me so I got to go check out
their warehouse which if you're into

584
00:39:29,850 --> 00:39:34,920
hardware and soldering it was like
paradise

585
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,500
this place was phenomenal

586
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,480
um but they donated a bunch of kids
which we have here for tomorrow and some

587
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,260
prizes in this right here was like about
a hundred seventy dollar retail and that

588
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,510
was a prize when you consider what we
charge 40 43 dollars for the kids to

589
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,480
enter about 25 for the parents

590
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,750
you know if you win no complaints

591
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:00,170
parents like thrilled actually was
thanks by the parent when his kid picked

592
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:03,230
that because he's like now I don't have
to go buy that from my kid

593
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:05,870
this is awesome because you play with
the snaps are gonna be like I want it

594
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:09,799
and that when you can build into an AM
and FM radio which is actually pretty

595
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,670
cool

596
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:13,940
no starch give this book so we donate
books

597
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:18,560
we also have coupons so if you pick up
any of those flyers are still out on the

598
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,580
table

599
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,400
get a discount also on some books not
just kids books they're doing nose like

600
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,250
we like to get that hardware so we like
we have a conic kid

601
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:32,420
so now the full pies raspberry pi 3
khana khate or we've been other hardly

602
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,700
knows you know the condo kit which is
the bigger one with the keyboard and the

603
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,669
speaker and like your own raspberry pi
computer

604
00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:44,270
we've been giving those away as well we
just don't have her tomorrow

605
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:48,440
but like to give him some hardware if
it's tangible it feels like you really

606
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,200
want something i'm speaking of that

607
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,660
who knows what this is one of my
favorite Holies

608
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,299
it's the DC darknet badge so if you go
to DC dark dot net and now it's actually

609
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,980
probably a pretty good time to go

610
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:07,700
that's right before Jack on usually
about a month before they they

611
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,689
reactivate the demon and if you like
these kinds of challenges I mean even my

612
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:15,650
10 year old he started doing these a
couple years ago and it's just basic

613
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:19,700
stop right it's just decoding something
that has like a simple Caesar cipher or

614
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:26,060
converting hex to something else and you
build points but they also have in their

615
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:30,890
hardware hacking village the DC darknet
bad about twenty-five dollars and it's a

616
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:31,759
solder kit

617
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,420
this is the one that i put together and
it's it's lit up on the top but they got

618
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:42,080
some like Ellen led SNP's that you just
kind of solder put on the back but if

619
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,350
you look at the bottom

620
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:50,339
there's transmit and receive leds and
those the band just talk to one another

621
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,800
which is pretty cool

622
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,520
and that was a part of the challenge
because the more badges you associate

623
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,259
with the more points you get

624
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,040
and the USB connector at the top you
supposed to plug that in and then figure

625
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,820
out how to get that off and enter those
flags

626
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:11,250
so it's a pretty cool kit but even that
um it's like an Arduino due in manova

627
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:18,930
chip that's there that I see and that is
supposed to have a sketch on there for a

628
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:20,339
TV be gone

629
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,300
so you know to see if you don't know
what a TV begun is it's basically you

630
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,030
push the buttons at best buy and you see
the TV go off

631
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:30,930
you kind of move position in the store
wait for them to turn them all back on

632
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:32,370
and then turn it off again

633
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:38,069
you know just kind of little trolling
harmless fun for you not them it's

634
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:41,730
basically teaching them to just
deactivate the IR on the TV

635
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:45,030
no but the kids were all like I want it

636
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:48,990
they they kinda like the idea the
trolling but it also was like when a

637
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,290
idle state it was blinking a message in
Morse code

638
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:57,450
it does a bunch of things on the back of
it behind the the battery holder was

639
00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:00,450
like another encoded message that's a
bunch of things on there

640
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,669
they still have them very hard to get if
you go to DEFCON try and get it on

641
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,710
Thursday because if you wait till
saturday

642
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:13,920
there's going to be no more and they
donate them to us donated probably

643
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,230
around 12 or 13 so far

644
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,820
the kids love them on to pick them up in
their parents like one response to it as

645
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,580
a parent some don't some of them had a
solder

646
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:28,110
so take them to DEFCON or take them
someplace where there's going to be a

647
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:32,010
hardware hacking village and then have
them solder it up but yeah it's it's a

648
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,710
fun prize talked a lot about that sorry

649
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:39,960
gift cards to not very exciting as far
as a picture but we usually have some

650
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,890
who doesn't like - so you know we do
stuff with with that as well

651
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,820
like we're going to do a super bot
tournament tomorrow because we're going

652
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:50,430
to build some super bots battle

653
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:54,118
whoever wins the most battledore gets
the most points by the end of that

654
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:54,990
session

655
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:59,490
look at 25 I'll gift card you can go and
buy some pokemon backpackers

656
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:02,220
something'll come on go

657
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:06,660
I am i doing on time i'm doing alright
so i talked about the safe and secure

658
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,529
online home

659
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:12,210
sorry this this section is how do we
know what you know what we're doing is

660
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:12,960
working

661
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,619
it's really hard to know we we do
surveys

662
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,710
I'll show you that in a minute but with
the safe and secure online presentation

663
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:21,359
with the anti cyberbullying

664
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,700
I gotta tell you my oldest son he SAT
through eight or nine of these

665
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,049
presentations

666
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,380
since he was about six years old he gets
it

667
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:37,109
but even he fell prey to online cyber
bullying from his friends friend on a

668
00:44:37,109 --> 00:44:41,730
minecraft server and it wasn't
necessarily him it was my middle kid

669
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,650
that was being picked on in the
beginning

670
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,680
did you show each other's creations
that's how they troll one another the

671
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:53,759
grief that sly in Minecraft and my older
son made me proud was defending his

672
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,490
younger brother which is what we teach
them you know kind of take away the

673
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,049
audience of the bully and then the bully
has no real reason to bully anymore

674
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:07,800
because they're doing it because they're
want other people to make them feel good

675
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,280
because they pick on someone they laugh
they feel that they picked them pick on

676
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,450
the more they laughed more and that
makes a bully you take that element out

677
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:22,549
they have no motivation and my son was
trying to do that but for whatever

678
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:28,549
reason they started picking on him and
he overreacted punched his display and

679
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:31,099
completely cracked his laptop display

680
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:34,279
so you know not not good

681
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:37,789
so we're teaching them the right things
but even when they get very frustrated

682
00:45:37,789 --> 00:45:40,339
their heat of the moment they get angry

683
00:45:40,339 --> 00:45:45,078
it's it's hard to know how successful we
are and a lot of times we don't get that

684
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,529
kind of feedback so we were trying

685
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:53,420
it's very hard so we do a lot of surveys
surveys are hard to and trying to get

686
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,589
better at this

687
00:45:54,589 --> 00:45:58,219
but in this particular case I hope you
guys can read that

688
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:02,569
so that first one right there how many
hack the kids attended including this

689
00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:04,400
one circle one

690
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,150
so when I asked my eight year old at the
time

691
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:14,660
9 he said that means how many hackers
you want to and just circle number is by

692
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:16,189
then we've only had three

693
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:22,129
you know that when my wife she read it
she read it as well how many people you

694
00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:27,410
bringing or how many people are tending
had four kids I was like am I should

695
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,249
have you read this first because i had
people literally right in the number

696
00:46:31,249 --> 00:46:34,848
four and circle it wasn't a choice they
made it a choice

697
00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:38,839
so the data normalization is a big
problem because they're now filling out

698
00:46:38,839 --> 00:46:43,670
a survey for for kids who had four
different opinions but it's one response

699
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:48,890
what do I do with that I don't know how
accurate it is is it an average I don't

700
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:49,489
know

701
00:46:49,489 --> 00:46:53,900
um unfortunately nobody put anything for
gender they all left

702
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:57,709
male female they didn't add anything
they're special that is good but even

703
00:46:57,709 --> 00:47:01,249
other problems on here

704
00:47:01,249 --> 00:47:04,308
I'm crazy like this is these top two

705
00:47:04,939 --> 00:47:09,499
we had two workshops you can only attend
one I had people fill in both

706
00:47:10,729 --> 00:47:14,009
what do I do with that which was right

707
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:16,380
I can't hunt them down because they
don't want their name on it because we

708
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,090
want to keep it anonymous

709
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,270
all right so it goes on and on and on

710
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,180
some people just kind of filled in 45 45
45 / that doesn't help

711
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,529
so we moved to like survey monkey which
you probably like why don't you just do

712
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,280
that in the beginning

713
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:36,030
well when you put a piece of paper in
front of somebody and say fill this out

714
00:47:36,030 --> 00:47:38,220
and then when you're done many prizes

715
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:41,490
there's an intent but if you send them
an email

716
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,000
hey answer these questions you know even
i know it's a week later

717
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:52,020
can all the answers you get I think I've
had six people so far respond from our

718
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:57,780
chicago event which was two and a half
weeks ago so it's like what do you do

719
00:47:57,780 --> 00:47:58,470
with that data

720
00:47:58,470 --> 00:48:03,480
it's a smaller representation of the
population you try

721
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:10,440
now this is really my weak attempt at
creating an infographic infographics are

722
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:11,370
cool

723
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:20,430
so who's behind looking back at 2015
kind of give you some numbers had 53

724
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:24,690
kids registered 53 kids showed up

725
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,990
that's pretty cool that is really cool

726
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:32,189
our first year we had 40 registered and
we had 38 show up

727
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:38,160
now if we made it free like the state of
Illinois wants us to do in order to be

728
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,270
recognized as a true charity and
actually you know making a charitable

729
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:46,500
effort to the community we would get
probably a hundred and fifty two hundred

730
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,610
people registered and still probably
have 50 people show up but we would

731
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:57,120
order 200 sandwiches we would order 200
shirt we would get 200 badges but there

732
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,120
is no state of Illinois saying well
we'll make up the difference

733
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,660
so it's

734
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:07,640
something we have to do nominal fee it's
below our costs but you can see the

735
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:09,290
attrition is very low

736
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:15,410
I'm gender breakdown so of the 53 that
attended 39 were boys you can tell by

737
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,520
the color blue

738
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,160
maybe i should use pink put the girls
are 14 that have previously attended a

739
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,970
hack for kids the first line with 36
that was their first

740
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:31,970
so last year our second year doing this
in chicago we had a lot of new New

741
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:36,709
attendees and participants the two and
two

742
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:43,040
that was their second time attending a
hacker kid and the one boy was obviously

743
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,000
my son

744
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,470
maybe not so obviously who went to every
event with me and he went to three

745
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:54,200
just got interesting in the age range
because this is another hard thing

746
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:58,100
it's I see some of these events that
there for 5 year olds and six-year-old

747
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:03,830
that takes a lot more one-on-one time
because of my four-year-old and I and

748
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:07,430
even when he was three and we're using
on the game called robot turtles

749
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:10,940
it's basically teach programming and
kind of logic and flow control like

750
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:16,010
stuff like that is a physical board game
he loves it but it's a lot of one-on-one

751
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:21,440
time so it's kind of hard to do that
with what we do so we kind of play with

752
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,460
that and we want to maybe reduce the
older aid like we want to make it maybe

753
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:31,760
8 to 13 and then we can have more things
kind of gauge in that range but we still

754
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,800
get enough kids that are teenagers but
our sweet spots really like eight to 12

755
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,450
8 to 12 years old so late elementary
school and middle school

756
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:47,450
now the activity station i mentioned
before I kind of just mentioned a couple

757
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:52,879
of the most popular was the technology
destruction village where they get to

758
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,660
take take apart and look at it but they
don't just get to destroy it and move on

759
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:01,130
they have to identify components if I
that's cool

760
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,090
other people have the idea well why
don't we have them take the parts and

761
00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,030
glue gun and build something new which
is fine because then I don't have to

762
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:13,250
take it to a new recycles plant which is
great for me but you know what else

763
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,940
could we do with it and we avoid mercury
but

764
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:20,200
hold that the most popular was the
technology destruction village of the

765
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,859
most attended the lockpick village who
doesn't like the pop a lock

766
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:30,460
one kid in the survey only pop handcuffs
and nothing else

767
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:36,100
which makes you wonder what their future
career might be and not law enforcement

768
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:43,390
so in the LP v we had 20 kids actually
go of the 53 of that we had

769
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:52,509
what is that a 12-12 pop five pins super
686 pop six pins which is really

770
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:53,590
impressive

771
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:57,640
I don't think i could do six pins and I
know I can do five and then nine did

772
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:02,859
cuffs the colors of the individual kids
really don't need a living in the

773
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:08,170
network security section which is
wireshark and comparing telnet vs si Jin

774
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:16,630
HTTP HTTPS we had seven of nine kids do
all the exercises and then another seven

775
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:20,620
actually tried to do the hidden file
challenge which was essentially reading

776
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:24,790
through the the traffic and a pcap to
find the link to the image

777
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,500
pull down the image and then there's
your prize congratulations you can you

778
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:34,450
know was very simple for you know people
doing CTFs but a challenge for someone

779
00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:39,759
who's never ever looked at wireshark
before Python for kids we had 10 to 10

780
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:45,010
and of the ten all of them did all the
exercises or sorry to exercise it up to

781
00:52:45,010 --> 00:52:46,120
number three

782
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,270
- completed the challenges of the two

783
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:52,780
nobody was able to do that bonacci
series probably will need another word

784
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,610
for bonacci they just stopped

785
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:58,840
I don't know but it's those metrics are
hard and kind of going back to surveys

786
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,680
we want to try to change the model to a
way that we get more this information

787
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:07,779
like did they go to Fibonacci series try
to do it and then what happened

788
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:13,510
like you know why did they stop to as
educators we need to know this cell and

789
00:53:13,510 --> 00:53:17,710
then spy math 12 kids attended seven of
the eight

790
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:18,609
sorry

791
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:26,499
that's seven did seven of the eight
challenges and to actually did proves we

792
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:31,419
had 28 year old so the person the
teacher teaching them on this

793
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:36,039
they were learning more about how to
prove mass which was really not a part

794
00:53:36,039 --> 00:53:39,160
of the program he just kinda took the
initiative and he's like let me show you

795
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:44,890
how to prove this out and they got it
and he was like oh my god - what these

796
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:47,739
kids proves i proved they were eight

797
00:53:47,739 --> 00:53:51,789
I'm like awesome what kind of gauge it
because not all of them are ready for

798
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:52,480
that

799
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,819
but the guy's a math genius and he was
super thrilled technology destruction

800
00:53:57,819 --> 00:54:02,319
village 14 kids attended um and what is
that five kids identified seven

801
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:05,769
components because they got to go and
look this is a resistor this is pastor

802
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:10,930
and look like all of them identify the
capacitor some of the comments to on

803
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:13,930
those sheets and we got back you can
read this for yourself

804
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:18,430
you know while we might argue in the
industry

805
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:23,200
there's still a gender bias and there's
not an equal number of people and gender

806
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:28,299
everyone has their own opinion on that
we don't have an actual split but you

807
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:31,029
could see 39 and 14

808
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:36,640
what is that like 75 the 25-percent
maybe 60 40 something like that and I

809
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,940
don't think it has really anything to do
with gender I think it's just awareness

810
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:44,859
because i went to my second graders
class taught them

811
00:54:44,859 --> 00:54:49,450
of course I like half our history of
computers and let me answer some of your

812
00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:54,069
technical questions and then I handed
out flyers literally that day one of the

813
00:54:54,069 --> 00:54:57,970
girls went home gave it to her parents
and she was registered to have four kids

814
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,910
so I don't I think there's an interest

815
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:04,359
I just I don't know I don't know why
that I think it's just a matter of time

816
00:55:05,019 --> 00:55:09,098
like everything else lastly we hit the
top of the mountain

817
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:14,420
if you're interested go to the web site
maybe we can organize one in your area

818
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:18,440
hopefully you got something out of this
about hacking the next generation

819
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,100
here's some twitter handle something
happen to the bird oh there it goes

820
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:28,910
links to like roots asylum and and had
kids and I c squared and the link to the

821
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:34,069
page with the form and i also want to
thank MobileIron my employer for

822
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:38,510
sponsoring my travel is it makes me able
to come out here and talk to you nice

823
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:39,320
folks

824
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:42,980
but if you have any questions I think
you're anything i could take some

825
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:45,980
question

826
00:55:57,530 --> 00:56:10,580
yeah we we don't really believe in
having a structured program like they go

827
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:13,940
to skool skool tells them what they have
to learn

828
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:17,720
we want them to learn the way they want
to learn and we want them to do it

829
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:22,430
however they feel comfortable so for
example they walk in and they're like oh

830
00:56:22,430 --> 00:56:25,759
my god has eight tables to choose from I
don't know where to begin and when they

831
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,540
actually look at the table they might
see snap circuits and just go

832
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,589
so they get to choose and there's
somebody to kind of take them through

833
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:37,310
the exercises and challenges or they
might just see somebody sitting there

834
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:41,900
with a laptop and these little tiny
computers raspberry PI's a little servo

835
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,360
motor and they might that looks kind of
cool

836
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,380
tomorrow we're doing it a little
differently just because we can get

837
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:51,590
involved here's we're actually going to
go more through series kind of

838
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,390
traditional classroom style

839
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:58,819
just because it takes a lot of bodies do
that but yeah it's it's really up to

840
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:03,740
them and with the laptop we do have an
online CTF so CTF the hacker kids calm

841
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,640
even if you're not a kid you want to do
the challenges that's fine you got to be

842
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,190
present to win and if you go there I one
that's me and you're like

843
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:15,910
over the age of 17 you're disqualified
from a prize

844
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:19,328
you can still brag that you want and you
beat a bunch of kids that's a few

845
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:25,420
yeah the top guy that put your next
question

846
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:31,690
I'm gonna break this down for the next
speaker but i can't a question
