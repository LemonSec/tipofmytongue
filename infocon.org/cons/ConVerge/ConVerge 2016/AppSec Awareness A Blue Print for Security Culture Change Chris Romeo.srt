1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,880
below is warm and no problem

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,619
I don't want to say i don't want to say
on earth because I might have been

3
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:22,619
someone here that was you know one argue
with me

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,970
don't show good on camera

5
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:43,110
Thank You casting thanks

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:52,349
ok so the topic that I'm going to speak
about today is in the realm of

7
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,100
application security and i know that a
lot of the the things that I've seen in

8
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:59,219
the conference you know or information
security red teaming and things like

9
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,609
that so I'm gonna I'm gonna go into
something that I'm very passionate about

10
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:07,290
and that is application security and how
do you roll that out to an entire

11
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,180
organization also i have been the CEO of
my own consulting company here for a

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,420
while

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,220
just since january but I've been in the
security business for 20 years doing

14
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,990
many different different types of roles
incident response your engineering

15
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:28,048
application security roles

16
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:33,060
I also spent 10 years at cisco systems
prior to january and with part of the

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,350
cisco secure development lifecycle team
part of the internal app set function

18
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,250
there

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:42,840
I had a chance to learn a lot in and and
apply a lot of the principles and things

20
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,509
that i'm going to talk to you about
today

21
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,640
so this is the the agenda what I want to
do in our about 40 minutes at a time

22
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,750
here first thing I want to do is just
explain what I think it is the problem

23
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,560
spacer or why do you need this thing
that I call application security

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,250
awareness

25
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:02,280
you know what what are the what are the
the reasons behind it would even be

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,610
something you want to consider your
organization and then I'm going to talk

27
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:09,119
a little bit about what i call
sustainable security culture and some

28
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,720
things that you can do to change the
security culture of

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,350
you know from an abstract perspective
infosec you know anywhere with

30
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,220
insecurity we all have a security
culture and then i'll talk about how you

31
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,090
can build one of these programs yourself
you know using some principles and

32
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:29,700
things that I've learned over time so a
famous philosopher from silicon valley

33
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,720
by the name of marketing Driessen who
also happens to be a multi-billionaire

34
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,600
and you know big investor he made this
statement about five years ago

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,970
software is eating the world and i think
it's still a relevant thing even even

36
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,650
more relevant as the years go by and me
we have more and more products and in

37
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,959
different types of things that have
software embedded in it

38
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,050
you know if you think about the the
number of computers and the lines of

39
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,360
code that running that a brand new
automobile

40
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,310
please use this year software truly is
everywhere and you know if we're going

41
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:05,730
to have software everywhere we have to
have application security everywhere

42
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:09,570
you know combined into you know this
this overall solution

43
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,200
you know I think about things like power
plants and medical devices

44
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,570
you know where we're software has been
kind of protected in its in its history

45
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,799
as those interfaces are starting to
become more and more out to the world

46
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:28,470
there's a lot of bigger challenges there
so customers demand security and

47
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:31,890
everything right i mean it you know we
probably all could just not our heads

48
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,429
and say yeah I mean it have you ever SAT
across the table from a customer and

49
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,410
they said yeah you know that security
thing

50
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,650
it's just not that important to us you
know our data is not that important you

51
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,280
know we're more into availability and
making sure that these systems are

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,790
always up and you know they never go
down but if you lose the data it's okay

53
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:52,350
nobody you know everybody is is fired up
about security now from a customer

54
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,760
perspective they want to ensure that you
have the right security features and

55
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,540
functionality and process and a lot of
times they want you to prove it

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:07,620
- so the OWASP top 10 show hands you're
familiar with the OWASP top 10

57
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:12,239
ok almost everybody leave your hand up
if you live and breathe do a stop in a

58
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,710
couple couple of diehard have sex clubs

59
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:21,550
the OS top 10 is just a nice a list of
web application security problems that

60
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,960
we've had historically it's about 10
years old at this point and it provides

61
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,900
a nice container or wasp is a great
organization for lots of different

62
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,130
information related to absolute if
you've never visited the OWASP website

63
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,090
you definitely should go there and you
can't find a program or project to get

64
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:38,679
involved with

65
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,150
but when I think about the OWASP top 10
you know we've been we've been having

66
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:46,780
these same vulnerabilities overtime
right we're not we're not getting any

67
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,679
better

68
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,770
these things haven't changed much in the
last couple of revisions and they're

69
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,099
doing a new revision now and my
prediction you heard it here first that

70
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,280
probably going to look almost the same
as this one right because we're not

71
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,539
getting any better at solving these
problems and i want to start a new

72
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:06,250
project called the OWASP top one because
if we could just knock injection out

73
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:10,510
just imagine how good you know all of
our web apps and our systems would be if

74
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,030
we could just not have sequel injection
involvement

75
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,260
so I introduced a wasp top 10just to to
show a nice graphic from the good folks

76
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,030
at very code they went in and did this
survey to see you know how many apps

77
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:29,380
folio lost top 10 upon initial
assessment and that's the percentage of

78
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,070
apps that failed you know if you look at
the government seventy-six percent of

79
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,090
apps that were assessed failed the OS
top 10 on the first time through you

80
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,090
know financial services comes in at
fifty-eight percent and that's the best

81
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:40,810
score

82
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:44,650
you know that they found in their
research here so that tells me that when

83
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,359
i get any better at fixing these
problems that we have and if we think

84
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,530
about where to vulnerabilities where
they come where they enter in are in the

85
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,760
process here

86
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,360
so this is you know a very simple
approach to the secure development

87
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,490
lifecycle its requirements design
development test and release and and

88
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,690
what I find in my travels and in my
experience at cisco and other places is

89
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:12,010
the majority of those vulnerabilities
actually get get you know they come into

90
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:16,599
the system via the design and
development phase and more times than

91
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,060
not this is mistakes or it's bad or what
I call batter on informed decisions

92
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,600
ok did

93
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,600
this is not a negligence problem we
don't have developers that are

94
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,740
generating vulnerabilities on purpose
right there that they're just don't they

95
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,090
don't understand how what they're
supposed to do to correctly deal with

96
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,650
these problems and so if you think about
the relative cost to fix vulnerabilities

97
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,609
I just slide that i'm almost a shame to
leave it in here because it shows up in

98
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,210
almost every you know application
security related talking days but I i

99
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:52,580
think it's still a powerful message
because you know if you if you fix the

100
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,490
vulnerability during the requirements
phase or what could become the

101
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:59,930
vulnerability it's very inexpensive if
you wait until after it's released it

102
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:03,680
gets very expensive 30 times more
expensive based on the research IBM did

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,230
back in the seventies of all places

104
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,820
so you know that this is an argument for
the fact that we need to teach the

105
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:14,180
developers and the testers and we need
to try and fix things you know

106
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,969
further back in our overall process and
so that leads me to think about the

107
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,130
mindset of the average developer

108
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,030
ok and so if you're a developer in the
room right now and you're at a security

109
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:26,809
conference

110
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,990
I got news for you you're not the
average developer what I'm talking about

111
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,870
okay you're somebody who's passionate
about security you've already you know

112
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,750
you caught the security bug and you want
to you know you want to make things

113
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,130
happen with security

114
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,360
I'm not talking when I say average i'm
talking about those people who maybe

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,270
don't know anything about application
security

116
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,820
you know they're they're charged with
writing code for a particular feature

117
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,900
and they just don't know what they're
supposed to do you know they're measured

118
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:55,340
based on their code being bug-free not
necessary security bug free that will

119
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,479
play in but you know how bug-free is
their code is it on time is it feature

120
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,670
complete and is it on budget

121
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,180
you know now that I think about you know
these average developers are the people

122
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,230
that actually need you no more
assistance here in the process because

123
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,250
security is a stretch for them you know
they don't understand what the real

124
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,210
problems are

125
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,169
if you tell them that you know other
could be a sequel injection problem of

126
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,150
vulnerability in that piece of code

127
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:23,780
you know they've never they never
actually you know been taught well the

128
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,900
sequel injection is your asking them
you're speaking you know different

129
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,039
language student which you know we have
that we speak a different language and

130
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,450
in the world's here and we've got up we
got a level that

131
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:37,510
playing field and hope hope you know
help everybody to learn that language

132
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:39,250
with us

133
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:42,640
you know they're not developers are
monsters right

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,449
they're not you're not introducing these
vulnerabilities on purpose it's

135
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,570
accidental you know they want to do the
right thing

136
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,380
they just don't know what that is
granted sometimes they can be stubborn

137
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:57,250
you know along the way in the process
but you know they're not they're not

138
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,410
negative and not trying to do this on
purpose

139
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:02,800
make sure there's one out of a thousand
developers that might be negligent but

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,170
you'll find them the other other means
of the process so that the goal that I

141
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:13,599
always work towards here is I want to
generate a culture where developers

142
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,630
think like security people

143
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:20,500
ok and you know a lot of people throw
around the terminology they say well you

144
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,870
know I want our developers to think like
hackers

145
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:27,190
ok I don't want developers would think
like hackers right i want developers

146
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,580
that think like security people that
know the policies the process the

147
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,900
procedures as well as the technology all
working together you know anyone in one

148
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,600
type of the solution we ultimately we
want the security light bulb to go on

149
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,650
for them you know and and I've seen that
happen in my travels at cisco where

150
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:48,550
where I'd be working with a team and
explaining to them you know how to do

151
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,370
threat modeling and you know in the
beginning they just push it back on

152
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,910
you're just asking me to do busy work
and and things that just don't matter

153
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,500
and then you go through the threat
modeling exercise with them and all of a

154
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,740
sudden the light bulb goes on you know
we had one more that where a guy

155
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,330
actually got up and said I got to go

156
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,780
like where you goin with the middle of
meeting i gotta go fiction code

157
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,120
I got it I got that problem you're
talking about it and it's killing me

158
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,560
right now that i'm not that it's in my
code so you know it's it comes down to

159
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,619
you know I how do we get that light bulb
to go on for them

160
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:24,580
so another philosopher from Silicon
Valley tim ferriss famous for the 4-hour

161
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:27,790
workweek which I don't think actually
works

162
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,500
but you know maybe make it doesn't mean
it's just an idea but he had this great

163
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,510
I great that definition of culture that
he threw out on Twitter and

164
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:41,460
I just added the word security into it
because you know I thought it was just

165
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:46,200
really just a really pointed you no
explanation of what i think of when i

166
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,490
say security culture

167
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,700
what happens with security when people
are left to their own devices

168
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:55,110
so do people do that they make the right
decision when nobody's looking over

169
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,010
their shoulder because they're educated
they know better or do they

170
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,120
you know do they just make the they just
take the easy way out or do whatever

171
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,560
it's going to be fast to get the product
of shit and that's the true measure of

172
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,349
your security culture we can talk
metrics and other things all day long

173
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:13,050
but if you don't have developers that
are making the right decisions when

174
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,579
nobody's looking

175
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,500
you know it's it's a it's a lost battle
there and you have to do something to

176
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,690
change the culture along the way and so
you know application security that these

177
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:28,830
are too kind of things that I that I
like to kind of summarize up you know

178
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:32,220
about the application security problem
first of all applications securities

179
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,300
about the people

180
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,530
ok and the people are the ones who
introduced the vulnerability

181
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,500
now tool vendors are going to disagree
with me heavily on this point

182
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,950
okay that they're going to say that
application security about the pooling

183
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,120
in the technology

184
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,950
ok I violently disagree the tooling and
the technology is a great support

185
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:57,780
platform but that you know if the if the
people don't know how to actually use

186
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:04,050
the technology you know a fool with the
pool is still a fool right was a you

187
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:07,589
know Grady Booch famous computer
scientist that was a quote from him but

188
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,690
it applies to security tools right

189
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:12,900
you know if you turn somebody loose on a
tool and they don't have any idea what

190
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,270
the principles are what it's supposed to
be doing

191
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:18,030
they might get results but they're not
going to know what to do with them you

192
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:21,150
know and that's the problem we have when
when we do static analysis

193
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,350
you know of code and when we have
somebody end up with a you know a

194
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,500
50-page report and like I can't do
anything with this and they just toss it

195
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:28,890
away

196
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:32,760
it states too complicated too hard so it
you know it's it's about it's about

197
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:36,150
getting the people to the point where
they're ready to you will be able to

198
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,459
deal with these issues

199
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,820
ok so why couple of reasons for why we
would want to change the security

200
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,660
culture

201
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,870
ok and yes clearly I have made some bad
decisions

202
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,170
ok you know there's there's bad
decisions that are potentially being

203
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,719
made in the organization they're being
tracked through the day they're

204
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,620
manifesting as bugs and vulnerabilities
and things you know so there's there's

205
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,380
some number of those type of problems

206
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,910
maybe the process is broken or maybe you
don't even have a process right i mean

207
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:05,790
if you don't have a secure development
life cycle at this point and that's

208
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,569
something that that you've got to take a
very close look at because that is the

209
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:13,080
that's the book that you go back and
point to when somebody says I don't have

210
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,460
to do static analysis

211
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,250
I don't know we have a process that says
this is the reason things that happened

212
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,710
at each level along the way and then the
tools you know you may have the tools

213
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,120
that they may not be tuned

214
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:28,350
you may not have tools at all you know
as part of your as your overall security

215
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,370
culture

216
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:34,200
so when I think about a security culture

217
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,790
I like to think of this in the context
of a sustainable security culture

218
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,660
ok because it's really easy to get
something to change for a day

219
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,200
slightly harder for a week

220
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,070
a little bit more harder for a month you
start to talk years

221
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,090
that's really hard to get things to
change you know that that the duration

222
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:56,040
that last over a long time

223
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,040
so anything that we do from a security
culture perspective has to be focused on

224
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,500
how do we make this sustainable so that
it exists

225
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,800
five years from now even if the people
that created that are no longer with the

226
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,729
organization

227
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,440
you know maybe new people come in take
on this role with so the first first

228
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,590
thing I like to think about for my
sustainable security culture that has to

229
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:14,460
be deliberate

230
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,750
so it has to be on purpose and it has to
be disruptive if somebody is not in your

231
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,080
office screaming at you because of the
changes you made

232
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,410
you did not go far enough in your
culture change ok so that's a great

233
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,980
metric right is somebody angry to the
point where they're yelling at you about

234
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,840
you know about what you've done

235
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,810
you know that's a good thing for my
perspective might be apologize but

236
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:39,630
that's the second thing is we want to be
engaging and fun you know for so long

237
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:42,210
you know and it just killed me security

238
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,380
we've always been the Department of well
what's the one word that people always

239
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,480
associate will know right

240
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,170
you know whether for the Department of
know you know where the stodgy people

241
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:55,529
that don't allow the developers to have
any fun of your organization you know

242
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,089
so we got to change that perspective
we've got to figure out how do we engage

243
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:04,290
how do we make this is this idea of
security more fun and you no more

244
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:08,699
cutting edge we got to become the that
the Department of know but you know not

245
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,479
just know what we want to help them do
cool things as well and and encourage

246
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,350
them on sustainable security culture has
to be rewarding

247
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,920
ok you have to have some way to
recognize people for doing good things

248
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,769
you know people love to be recognized

249
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,220
right some people arrive on just
received an email

250
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,010
no manager this is how you did a good
job most of us or like no cash deposits

251
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:37,170
in our bank account but you got to find
ways to reward people for doing making

252
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:40,829
the right decision because over time
they'll start to do that those decisions

253
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:43,680
become part of just how they do things
how they do business

254
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,130
the last part is the the idea of return
on investment so we do have to have some

255
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:54,810
type of metrics that can be shared up to
the executive level to demonstrate here

256
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,899
are the things you know here's the
reason why this culture change is

257
00:15:57,899 --> 00:15:58,889
successful

258
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:04,230
here's how the the the the organization
is changing over time to justify the

259
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,350
fact that we're going to need money to
make these things happen so that has to

260
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,040
be it has to be you know it's probably
the least fun of off for the things on

261
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,329
the list there but it's a necessary
thing to you know the success of your

262
00:16:15,329 --> 00:16:16,769
program

263
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,250
ok so how do we how do we change the
security culture we're going to focus on

264
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,420
the humans so that now we're getting
into kind of my my methodology of how I

265
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,910
think about how to how to change the
culture

266
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,529
so the first thing we have to do is we
have to open the developers testers

267
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,480
other people's eyes guy this is an
awareness play and this is an awareness

268
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
in the in the traditional security
awareness space right we already have

269
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,849
lots of people that are doing that this
is not just anti-phishing don't let

270
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,230
people chase you to the door

271
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:49,920
you know I don't let Microsoft calls you
on the phone that's probably not down

272
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,680
no it's not that type of training that
we're looking at here it's it's a

273
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,540
foundational set of application security

274
00:16:55,540 --> 00:17:00,040
things that we want people to know you
know this is the basic idea what's the

275
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,560
difference between an exploit the
vulnerability

276
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,678
right when I walk around an organization
that I'm working with

277
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,699
I love that if i can just walk up to
someone at random and asking that

278
00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:13,600
question right because if they have that
level of understanding doesn't mean

279
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,168
they're a security expert and i'll never
ask them to be but it means that they

280
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:22,000
have that foundational understanding of
what goes into absolutely

281
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,669
the second thing is we we need to start
filling the brains

282
00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:32,410
ok this comes down to knowledge you know
we need to we need to provide them with

283
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,600
some facts and some details on our
process and how to use our tools and all

284
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,010
the different pieces that are contained
within our application security program

285
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,129
and they need that knowledge perspective

286
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:48,520
the third thing is we got to fill their
brains with history

287
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,520
ok if your company is longer than older
than a year

288
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,179
you probably have some bug database that
tracks back security vulnerabilities and

289
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,790
and security bugs over time and that's a
great place to mine for data to feed

290
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:09,970
into your security culture program
because you know you want people to

291
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,929
understand the problems that companies
had in the past so we don't repeat them

292
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:15,010
in the future

293
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,610
right so so what you like to do is I
like to look and see you know what are

294
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,939
the top ten problems that companies had
and then I like to make sure that that

295
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,480
those get interwoven into the culture
changing program right from the

296
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,120
beginning because we might as well go
for the things that have been the

297
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,129
biggest let's go for the biggest
problems

298
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,490
you know I maybe that means we focus on
just three of them are one of them

299
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,380
but but focusing on that historical you
and the last part of pulling their

300
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,900
brains is has to be rolled specific

301
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,880
ok you cannot expect the developer to be
entertained by a vulnerability scanning

302
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,909
set of combat by unless you're operating
in an agile world where developers are

303
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:55,929
doing all the different testings and
roll and things and maybe you're there

304
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,790
but in the traditional sense you have to
be real specific with your content so if

305
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:04,139
you have a developer's you know set up
some different roles for the

306
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:08,280
you know if you have people that are
specifically java programmers give them

307
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,720
learning

308
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,750
you know I secure coding job and don't
don't expect them to sit through a

309
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:17,730
sequel right it's not it's not practical
for them and that'll immediately caused

310
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,120
them to kind of say this program is just
wasting my time you know and that's what

311
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,939
we're trying to avoid trying to avoid
anybody you know having a negative

312
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:30,720
opinion of what we're trying to do the
the next part is tasking their hands

313
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,020
so if we're going to take these this
knowledge and we're going to try to

314
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,389
stick these facts into people's heads

315
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:41,310
we have to have them back it up by
actually doing some overtime so I saw up

316
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:44,460
an interesting chart it was like the
six-month window from the time you take

317
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,150
training until I guess the time you take
training and tell you

318
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,680
six months later I mean the graph looks
just like this this is what you knew the

319
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,630
day the training ended this is what you
know at the end which is almost zero so

320
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,320
the six-month retention of the things
that we learned like in a classroom

321
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,909
environments almost Europe

322
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,910
unless we actually get to use those
principles

323
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,570
you know if we it work if we can put
those things in the use

324
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:13,500
then we remember things a lot better and
that's where this activity comes in here

325
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,100
we have to have activities set up in
this culture changing program for people

326
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:21,149
to actually take the principles from the
learning and then start typing on the

327
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,420
keyboard making stuff happen you know
whether it's secure coding or doing a

328
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,480
threat model or running a vulnerability
testing cool

329
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,430
those are the things that really cement
these concepts and people's lives and

330
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:37,080
the last thing is you know this culture
changing program has to have a community

331
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,919
it starts to wrap around all the people
who are passionate about security

332
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,430
these are called many different things
in different companies i seen them

333
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,080
called security champions security
advocates security guild members you

334
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,750
know but they're all talking about the
same exact thing

335
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,500
let's get a group of people who love
security together and let them mentor

336
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,360
and bring other people in and let's
let's use this as a way to challenge

337
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,760
people help them to grow but also build
our security capability and you can do

338
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,940
this you know with online communities
you can do this with monthly training

339
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,680
meetings

340
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:14,220
you could even get as crazy as having an
internal security conference what I did

341
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,220
at cisco Iran

342
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,340
you know big internal security
conferences when we bought five hundred

343
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,510
thousand people together that we're
passionate about security so so that's

344
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:27,580
the community angle of this and so this
idea of application security awareness

345
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:30,428
is is kind of perfect from my
perspective this is where all these

346
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,970
things come together you know from an
awareness and from a knowledge activity

347
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,240
community how do you wrap that around
into a program that you can actually

348
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:43,539
deploy in the organization and so this
is this is how I think about you know

349
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:46,390
where application security awareness

350
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,289
it's on the security loan inspector
already talked about you know that the

351
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:55,150
general security awareness kind of sets
off to the left side here and then I

352
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:58,510
think of the to what I call traditional
security training sitting to the right

353
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,789
hand side that may be in MIB
instructor-led in a classroom it may be

354
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,650
video-based but the challenge that I
have and and the challenge that caused

355
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:12,490
me to even go down the road that I've
gone down to build these types of

356
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,669
programs is you know traditional
training is boring

357
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,990
all right i mean if you think about the
last couple of training classes you had

358
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:21,820
to do for work you know

359
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,970
can you think what was there one of them
where somebody wasn't reading off the

360
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:29,860
script to you and we just we just don't
learn when people read off the script to

361
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,219
us

362
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,000
it just doesn't you know we're all very
good at hitting play and then doing

363
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,419
something else and then coming back and
passing the assessment that's required

364
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:40,900
you know that compliance right and and
security

365
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,200
you know learning shouldn't be a
compliance activities because you know

366
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,220
you never we all know that compliance
doesn't actually cause change you know

367
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,150
it can cause you know what kind of a
level set across an organization but

368
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,730
there's not gonna be anything change
happens that

369
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,730
so what you know that the benefits here
we everybody gets a a foundational

370
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:01,659
knowledge

371
00:23:01,659 --> 00:23:05,740
you know developers learn those detailed
lessons we get some activity and we get

372
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,600
that community kind of coming together

373
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,719
you know as the benefits of what these
things do so you know I'm that this talk

374
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,500
is not specifically about what I did at
cisco but if you're curious about the

375
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,159
the program that i built there in the
five years before I left

376
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,620
cisco there's a blog post on cisco's
website that didn't delete it when I

377
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:31,179
the company which is nice little but you
can go and just read and there's a nice

378
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,090
video there it gives you an example
about this application security

379
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:37,240
awareness what does it look like in a
big company like Cisco you know how did

380
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,680
it play out so when these slides will be
available after the talk as well as she

381
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,660
hits that one all the life

382
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,770
so let's transition now from kind of the
problem space and talking about culture

383
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:51,910
into how could you actually build one of
these things in whatever organization

384
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:57,460
you sitting and I'm i'm convinced that
you know small organizations big

385
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,150
organizations everybody can do this it
just comes down to scale right

386
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,900
you don't necessarily have to have a
hundred people you know to to make this

387
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,800
possible

388
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,820
you can do this with a small group of
people along the way and it really comes

389
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,790
down to four different pieces of this
type of the program you know if you have

390
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,570
to have like everything you have an
architecture you have to figure out what

391
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:21,250
you're going to do with your content and
then and then weave in the idea of humor

392
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,970
into your content and I'll go into that
some more details about that and then

393
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:29,050
you know a game if we keep the
gamification of learning is a very

394
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,110
popular thing right now it's about how
do we how do we use video game

395
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:36,070
principles to connect with our learners
and engage them in the process

396
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,389
so we're going to you know from an
architectural perspective this is our

397
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:45,610
this is our overall design document or
for a program and there's some steps

398
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,928
that we want to go through along the way
to you know help us ensure that this

399
00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,530
program is actually going to meet the
needs of the consumers that exists in

400
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,300
the company

401
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,570
so the first thing that we want to do is
is we want to assess the security

402
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,370
culture and figure out what's actually
happening there and you know you can do

403
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,409
this you know informally

404
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,040
you can do it normally there's
methodologies like open sam from the old

405
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,090
wasp project where it's a it's a
maturity model where you can kind of go

406
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:16,419
through rate your company based on
different levels and it gives you a good

407
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,700
idea as to where you where you stand

408
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,660
informally you know and and the way that
I like to do this is to do you know

409
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,280
focus groups and interviews and you know
I go into a company to do these that the

410
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,910
company always sets up all the
interviews and then i say let's go walk

411
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:33,820
around for a minute because now the now
we're off script

412
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,760
I hate it now we're going to walk down
the hallway and I'll see somebody say

413
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:40,360
what do you know about security and then
it's not a prepared person that came off

414
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:44,199
in the list and makes people mad
sometimes but it gives me the answer i

415
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,650
mean you know as far as I am I getting
the right answer in the in the interview

416
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,460
room has actually happens in the end the
compass so but you really got to have a

417
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,510
good handle on the security culture
because that allows you to define what

418
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:00,280
is the actual problem with this company
is being you know do they lack general a

419
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:04,090
sec knowledge but they not understand
this idea of the threat landscape that

420
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,540
threats are constantly changing and
mixing up and making our world more

421
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,620
complicated

422
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:12,699
do they not have any experience with
secure development or maybe they're

423
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,150
lacking motivation but you gotta figure
out what that is in your organization

424
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:18,790
you know because it's going to be
different from you everybody's going to

425
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:21,580
have a different list here of what the
problem actually looks like

426
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:27,250
and then the the another thing that's
very important to build up a team to

427
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:33,040
assist with this and you know in the
past I've built teams of internal and

428
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,790
external people that support this
overall mission of creating no one of

429
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,480
these types of programs you may have
folks that help you with content

430
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,530
reviewing content subject matter experts
on particular technical topics that are

431
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,780
specific to your your company

432
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,930
I mean there's a there's a whole bunch
of people in the learning process that i

433
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:54,460
really never knew about and tell i got
into building these things

434
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,990
there's people called it the coolest
title ever psychometrician actually said

435
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:04,510
I'm the business guy and what that means
is they're experts and learning so most

436
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,140
of us in the room our security people
that love security but we're not the

437
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,540
best teachers and we don't build the
best content

438
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,170
we have a very technical content but its
necessary it doesn't necessarily

439
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,710
translate to the learner understanding
and that's what these psychometrician

440
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:21,430
people do for you in there they're
priceless because they can take very

441
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:25,810
detailed security content and turn it
into they can they make small

442
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,270
adjustments you look at it go really but
it

443
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:32,080
it influences it helps the learner to
understand the content better because

444
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,230
that's what they're experts in that's
what they go to college and understand

445
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:38,740
it's good to have different people on
this team as well don't just get

446
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:42,280
everybody from engineering you know
invite some people for my tea

447
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,120
you know i'll even dare say invited
people from marketing and sales but try

448
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,010
to have a very diverse functional team
to ensure that you have the best you

449
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:55,540
know best possible perspective on the on
how to how to solve your problem

450
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,350
statement

451
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,300
another big thing that I like to do here
is you know if you want to make this

452
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,510
thing fun you can have a theme for your
program

453
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,840
yeah you can't just call it the security
training time you know that's boring

454
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,189
nobody wants to let me wants to go to
that website so you know I've done

455
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,820
various different things in the past you
know i'm a big fan of the idea of

456
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,320
security ninjas and you might think
that's kind of you know not not that

457
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,770
cool or whatever but it gives you a lot
of room for cartoons and all kinds of

458
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:27,760
fun things that and it's crazy how many
people in a company that our developers

459
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,820
say i want to be a security enjoy that
sounds kind of cool

460
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:35,800
so that the theme becomes your marketing
platform which you know we were

461
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,250
technical people we don't like to think
about marketing but you know if you're

462
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:42,490
going to do something like this you have
to have a marketing function you have to

463
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:46,840
get the word out because you want more
people to get into the program you can

464
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,659
do you know security apprentice security
journeyman you know there you can find a

465
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:56,560
theme that specific to your organization
because it's going to be it's going to

466
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:59,980
be different right so what what are the
people what are the people like to do in

467
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,830
your company is there something you know
maybe they play Ultimate Frisbee I don't

468
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:06,010
know maybe you can have multiple levels
and open the fridge beer or something I

469
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:10,480
don't know but figure out what that
isn't in and connect it into you know

470
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,820
what your what your group is passionate
about

471
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:16,960
second thing is you have to have levels
in this program

472
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,550
ok you can't just do this is one class
because there's not enough

473
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:25,389
you can't pack enough into one class and
then it gets really long and in hard for

474
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,590
people to consume

475
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,110
so the idea with levels is we break up
the learning and the activity into

476
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:35,709
multiple channels for people to go
through here and this is an example of

477
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,990
what i do when i when i use the security
belt metaphor and you know when somebody

478
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,960
begins their process they can see where
is the end of this journey

479
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,529
right with you when you take an average
technical class

480
00:29:48,529 --> 00:29:52,370
there's really no - it right you just
take the class and you're done in like

481
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:57,199
great i'm a red hat certified something
or or whatever at the end but there's no

482
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,520
path to say here is I've become an
expert or a date someone who's very has

483
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,879
advanced knowledge and that's the idea
what these levels is his show people

484
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,960
that you are in your white belt and then
you want to continue continue and tell

485
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,620
you get up to that black belt you seen
as a leader you know inside your inside

486
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:17,510
your team inside your group and then
from a Rolls perspective you've got to

487
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:20,658
figure out what are the roles you're
gonna even a capture in your in your

488
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:22,669
upper and your program here

489
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:26,840
you know you're just going to go after
traditional software testers and and

490
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,360
managers maybe those are the three

491
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,719
you know you have the easiest ones to
hit but maybe you've got a DevOps

492
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,940
function or you've got IT or sales and
executive that you want to cover just

493
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,440
got to figure out what are those

494
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,090
no one of the roles you want to go after
this is this is a map of what i

495
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:46,490
recommend from an activity perspective

496
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:50,149
so when you get to those high levels and
in the systems that I create you

497
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,860
actually have to go to work for security

498
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,490
ok there's no longer any you know
watching videos or whatever you got to

499
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,899
actually do things and so I built this
list and you're gonna look at this

500
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,709
you're going to say wow that's really
high level and the answer is yes it's a

501
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,179
very high level on purpose

502
00:31:05,179 --> 00:31:08,899
ok I don't want a list of a thousand
activities because i want to manage

503
00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:12,260
lists of a thousand activity and i'm a
firm believer in the keep it simple

504
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:15,799
method of doing everything you know
figure out how to if someone has a

505
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:19,279
hundred of something let's see if we can
compress it down to eight and just keep

506
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:23,360
everything simple for everyone that's
involved in the process but those are

507
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,389
and you can you can adjust those
activities over time

508
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:29,149
you know you're one you may have a
certain set of activities you want to

509
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:30,408
encourage people to do

510
00:31:30,409 --> 00:31:34,700
maybe by year two or three something's
changed in your company and you need to

511
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,140
focus on something else

512
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:39,260
you know you can you can use these as a
driver when you get people excited about

513
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,740
wanting to learn the next belt just
become their playbook of what they're

514
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,779
going to go and try and do and then
recognition is a is another you know

515
00:31:47,779 --> 00:31:51,380
important piece of this and I've done
various things in the past to recognize

516
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,370
people on created custom lanyards that
have the color of the belt that allow

517
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,559
them to show off that

518
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,960
that they learned something new
certificates emails certificates have

519
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,259
you know different value in different
parts of the world

520
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,820
so if you're a global company you know
India and China have a much they put a

521
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,840
much higher value on receiving a
certificate they can print and hang in

522
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,408
there on their cue ball so that once
again it comes down into looking into

523
00:32:17,409 --> 00:32:21,309
your existing company and seeing what
are the one of the recognition things

524
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:26,379
that we have available that we can we
can use and like i said earlier cold

525
00:32:26,379 --> 00:32:30,129
hard cash is always a great great
motivator for anyone right now

526
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:36,219
so they can do whatever they want with
along the way so security culture

527
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,499
changes not an overnight program

528
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:41,710
okay you're not going to just go launch
something and by next riding and like

529
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,769
wow we just got this figured out and
this is this is you're in this for the

530
00:32:44,769 --> 00:32:48,279
long haul it's going to take you know
the program i built at cisco evolve over

531
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:54,249
five years from the time we started they
had the idea to when I left it and we

532
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:58,389
saw a lot of good things happen over
that time but it took that five-year

533
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,899
window

534
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:03,399
now you may be able to accelerate that
and see some good return in one year two

535
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:07,869
years but it's not it's definitely not a
two-week program and we move on

536
00:33:07,869 --> 00:33:11,289
so the the approach i take the content

537
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:16,299
ok so i like to use small 20 minute
video modules maximum for profit

538
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:20,740
ok and I'm even trying to compress those
down to closer to 10 minutes now because

539
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,429
we have the this this idea of the
YouTube generation right

540
00:33:24,429 --> 00:33:28,779
nobody wants to watch 60 minutes long
pieces of content they want them to be

541
00:33:28,779 --> 00:33:33,580
short to the point and you know give me
to get hit and hit the high points tell

542
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,689
me what's important but don't you know
don't be late for me with you know hours

543
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:43,330
of explanation i like to use a what I
call conversational and unscripted

544
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:47,710
ok so so get some security experts put
them in front of a camera use some

545
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,450
PowerPoint slides as a backdrop and just
have real conversations about security

546
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,169
you know if you get the right passionate
people on camera that passion shows

547
00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:00,190
through to the person who's watching
that video later because there's nobody

548
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:04,029
reading off a teleprompter reading off
the script it's it's it's the passion

549
00:34:04,029 --> 00:34:07,290
that they have about security that makes
the video interesting

550
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,070
so you know i do that in an interview
format you know think about why do so

551
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:15,510
many people watch jimmy fallon right
because they like to watch the interview

552
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:19,169
and and see what questions are going to
be assets it's just an engaging formats

553
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:22,799
fast it's moving is the cameras are
changing all the pond and it just makes

554
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,870
contents it's more interesting

555
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:30,089
after it for each module you want to
make sure you test the individual on

556
00:34:30,090 --> 00:34:34,410
what you want them to learn you know I
try not to do this I can to make this

557
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,178
PhD class and security

558
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:40,020
you know this is just comes down to list
just can't let us use this as a way to

559
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,400
reaffirm the most important key things
that i had in that module for them to

560
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,510
understand and try to make these you
know as fair as possible in in the

561
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,380
process

562
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,710
that's where the psychometrician is
coming into is their experts on how to

563
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:54,060
write test questions

564
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,529
so they can help you from you know
writing test questions that are just not

565
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:06,690
fair because I I tend to write questions
that are not fair for people that don't

566
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,830
speak english as their native language
because i tend to use double negatives

567
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:15,990
and things like that which for us if
you're a native English speaker you read

568
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,180
right through double negatives in a
question answer it

569
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:22,020
just normally but if you're not a native
English speaker speaker that double

570
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,900
negative actually have to really trip
you up a lot of times and cause you can

571
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,660
choose the wrong answer so that's where
the psychometricians come in and they

572
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:34,170
help you in that process resources if
you're going to have a module if you're

573
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:36,690
going to use this type of a compact
format

574
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,630
some people are going to finish that
module and they're going to say wow I

575
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,420
really want to dive deep into this and
and learn more about

576
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,050
so give them those resources right away
you know what it is a tab right in your

577
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,170
interface so they finish the video
they're like I want more information

578
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,470
you know if i did a module and threat
modeling here are some examples that may

579
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,859
be what somebody might want to go look
at for more information

580
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,870
here's a just a single slide that shows
you kind of my perspective from some

581
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:06,270
basic things i always put into my kind
of level water my white belts and you'll

582
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:10,110
notice there's really not a lot not any
technology related things in that level

583
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:14,220
one and that white belt because i want
that to be applicable to everyone

584
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:20,229
or in an organization right not just
technical people I want executive sales

585
00:36:20,229 --> 00:36:24,038
I want everybody to have that foundation
of upset because when they have that

586
00:36:24,039 --> 00:36:29,679
foundation they know it can positively
impact their job and you know how can

587
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,429
that impact the sales process while
sales people get asked questions about

588
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:36,609
security all the time and most of the
time they say I don't know let me take

589
00:36:36,609 --> 00:36:41,109
that as a action and go back but if they
have a basic understanding of what your

590
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:45,339
stl is they're not going to be an expert
in it but maybe they can answer maybe

591
00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:48,339
they can answer a question by saying I'm
yeah we have a secure development life

592
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:52,989
cycle we have security baked into you
know and built into every phase in this

593
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:54,249
the customers gonna go

594
00:36:54,249 --> 00:37:00,519
whoa cool you know great answer so and
then when you get to level 2 it becomes

595
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:03,189
more about you know and that gives you
an opportunity to jump into the

596
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:05,259
technical side and dive deeper into you

597
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:09,279
you know things like secure design
principles secure coding and attacking

598
00:37:09,279 --> 00:37:13,689
and and I like to focus on things like
input validation and you know output

599
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,319
encoding and the things that really trip
up the developers with that language

600
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:21,819
very specifically hit those big problems
and and go right Adam and try to you

601
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:24,130
know try to eliminate them from the
process

602
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:29,199
this just gives you a view of how i
create content right now this is the

603
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,609
process that i use on what i recommend
for folks to do it begins with an

604
00:37:33,609 --> 00:37:36,279
outline and you'll notice that their
instructional designers those

605
00:37:36,279 --> 00:37:40,449
psychometrician that they're called both
of those terms they

606
00:37:41,019 --> 00:37:44,709
I bring them in the early after i have
an outline and then I bring them in to

607
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:48,368
review my content that goes into the
power points because they can provide

608
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:52,059
interesting feedback at both stages
there they can help me in the outline to

609
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:54,969
make sure I don't go down and do a bunch
of work that that they're going to say

610
00:37:54,969 --> 00:38:00,189
is not really you know good for the
learner will this is just an example

611
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:05,379
slide of this is this is from my
fundamentals module that i use these

612
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:05,920
days

613
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,779
this is the type of content that i use
as a backdrop to a conversation that I

614
00:38:10,779 --> 00:38:12,519
might be having you know on video

615
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:16,508
when I'm talking about you know how
vulnerabilities exploits and attacks run

616
00:38:16,509 --> 00:38:19,719
together I've got definitions and then
we're talking about well then you know

617
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,119
we'll talk about here is the definition
of those things and now how do these

618
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,779
things work together you know so that
the person can actually submit that in

619
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:30,739
their mind that it's not just a an
independent thing but you know moment

620
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:34,039
abilities become exploits which resulted
become attacks

621
00:38:34,039 --> 00:38:41,149
no vision ok so if we get into the idea
of humor and story so we got to find a

622
00:38:41,149 --> 00:38:43,879
way to make this content a little bit
more interesting for people

623
00:38:43,879 --> 00:38:47,779
ok so that the conversational nature of
the content tends to be more engaging

624
00:38:47,779 --> 00:38:53,089
and it's easy it's harder to you know
just hit play and walk away but we gotta

625
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:58,339
find ways to to bring humor into you
know directly into the contract

626
00:38:58,339 --> 00:39:02,808
so what I like to do is I use these
things I call security medical and

627
00:39:02,809 --> 00:39:04,399
security metaphors is too short

628
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:09,979
30 second clip that I am 10 right at the
beginning of the module and sometimes

629
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:15,019
all create a whole series of those those
type of metaphors that tell a story

630
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:19,069
you know I've done some of the past was
just you know three frame cartoons with

631
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:21,649
voice overs and they tell a story about
this

632
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:25,669
this village and all these different
people are attacking the village and and

633
00:39:25,669 --> 00:39:29,388
the people that are attacking become you
know kind of metaphors for different

634
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:33,379
types of but you know denial service
somebody dumps dirt into the well you

635
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:35,659
know and the people are struggling with
how we're going to get water

636
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:39,739
you know so it's a way to take a
security concept and illustrated you

637
00:39:39,739 --> 00:39:43,339
know in it in a different way with with
you know some pictures and cartoons and

638
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:48,349
pens so there's you know there's three
different ways that I've done this type

639
00:39:48,349 --> 00:39:50,689
of humor i mentioned the still cartoons

640
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:54,678
we've done done full motion cartoons
those get a little bit more expensive

641
00:39:54,679 --> 00:39:57,619
you know you start talking about
thousands of dollars to do full motion

642
00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,789
cartoons that jokes but you can also if
you have a creative video team that

643
00:40:01,789 --> 00:40:02,899
you're working with

644
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:06,109
they can you can actually create some
pretty funny medical or type stuff

645
00:40:06,709 --> 00:40:11,629
just by using the video resources that
you have I was at cisco we created

646
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:14,118
various different spruce of movies

647
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,739
for example so we did a spoof of the
movie office space which some people

648
00:40:18,739 --> 00:40:20,779
remember in the room here

649
00:40:20,779 --> 00:40:24,649
we had one guy dresses building and him
this money because he was a college kid

650
00:40:24,649 --> 00:40:26,509
who had never seen office space

651
00:40:26,509 --> 00:40:29,839
so he went to youtube and watch the
clips of milton and then he got his

652
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,810
costume on and we set him up on there
and

653
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:35,200
and the the joke was that somebody had
taken his network tester

654
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,160
you know and he was but it's you know
and it's not supposed to be you know

655
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,379
comedy movies that you're going to find
you know in the box office

656
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,140
it's just you want to get people to
smile a little bit and think yeah that's

657
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:50,200
kind of corny but you know it's funny
good job for for trying to mix things up

658
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,669
and make it long

659
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,390
now a word of caution on the humor
couple

660
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,830
ok corporate humor turns out is not
universal

661
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:02,830
ok everybody doesn't find everything as
funny as may

662
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:07,630
ok so that's so what I try to do is in
and it's kind of funny as I found this

663
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,160
picture before the Deadpool movie
actually came out but you know it's a

664
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,580
it's good to to strive for a TV

665
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:18,850
ege so if you're going to do anything
it's going to be for corporate

666
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,690
environment

667
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:23,530
if you are comfortable saying that's
tv-pg or a little bit less then you're

668
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,070
probably pushing that that's an envelope
you don't want to push that I pushed it

669
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:32,560
and have to retract some some videos and
things that were really funny but you

670
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,430
know it just it didn't I didn't fit in
in the culture so I'm just be cognizant

671
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:42,609
of that they you know tv-pg kind of rain
so a couple of things quickly about the

672
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:47,680
the world of gamification some people a
lot of people think Oh gamification that

673
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,040
means we add a video game pokemon go
into the middle of our learning

674
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,640
environment you know and and people
watch modules with different locations

675
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:57,160
when they find pokemons or something I
don't know

676
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,420
so gamification is about the principles
right lot of people play that Pokemon go

677
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,860
game there's probably some lessons that
we could apply to a training program

678
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,610
because they got so many people to jump
in and be a part of it so quickly

679
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:14,890
so gamification can play out you know
using things like badges and I somebody

680
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:18,759
finishes a certain number of modules
they get this badge they finish a level

681
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,010
you know the levels become part of the
gamification angle as well maybe they

682
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:27,070
finish a level maybe they get a badge
that shows a white belt that goes on

683
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,510
their internal directory

684
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:33,190
you know it's amazing how many people
think that's a really cool thing and a

685
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,180
really valuable thing and if you think
about it it cost

686
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:41,078
almost zero for for us as it as people
who are creating the program you have a

687
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,970
graphic artist draw this badge

688
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:46,509
he posted on the website as a potential
badge that can be added as cheap

689
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:52,420
recognition plays in there the journey
plays into the gamification angle as

690
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:58,000
well so you eat when you create a user
interface for your training program

691
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,030
don't just make it a web page with a
list of links on it

692
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,569
please you know that's what we have a
theme and that's what we're trying to

693
00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:09,069
make this fun build an interface for
your look for the learning that fits

694
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:12,730
into the theme you know if you're using
the security ninja idea that I've used

695
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:13,630
in the past

696
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:18,099
build a security dojo page where all the
modules are listed and use colorful

697
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:23,380
graphics that are created in the in the
same form as the you know as the rest of

698
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,760
the theme and you can do something you
know this is kind of a poor man's

699
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,440
version of this but you know as people
start to finish modules in a series you

700
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:35,589
can have the lady the wall starts to
fall down maybe so they're working

701
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:39,220
towards something visual in front of
them that part of their of their

702
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,569
learning journey

703
00:43:40,569 --> 00:43:45,759
you know one last thing about
gamification the idea of competition so

704
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,240
competition turns out is a huge benefit
from a game perspective and so what I

705
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,729
recommend that people do is create a
leader board type of an environment like

706
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:04,480
a dashboard that allows you to track
who's been you know who's received

707
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,569
different levels within your culture
changing program and then what you can

708
00:44:10,569 --> 00:44:15,069
do is you can actually show different
executives you know here's how you stack

709
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,690
up against your to peers

710
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,260
you know just you know you're a
10-percent there at 60 and 90 person

711
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:24,940
just want to show you you know and then
walk away quickly because they're going

712
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,180
to because that their operations
director will be running sprinting to

713
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:30,609
their office you know after they get
that phone call you know why getting

714
00:44:30,609 --> 00:44:34,029
beat by these other two people that the
executive may not even really care why

715
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:37,119
hear what it is they're getting beat
Alex don't give me that right

716
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,980
so use competition for your advantage
you know and and and let that dry the

717
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,530
program

718
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:46,160
so a couple of takeaways here

719
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,940
you know vulnerabilities are real and
everywhere we saw that you know in that

720
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:54,770
very code loss popped and we know that
from our our own existence our own

721
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,640
companies

722
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:59,089
if you want to change culture starts
with opening the eyes

723
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:03,080
that's the awareness side filling the
brains with knowledge and history of

724
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,340
where you've been and where we're going
and then task in those hand the same

725
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:13,880
hand with that kidney and I think of the
the programs as architecture content

726
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,840
you know this humorous story and then
gamification all these things you need

727
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:21,110
all of these pieces to have a successful
program that people actually enjoy

728
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:23,870
you know you can get away with leaving
some of them out but you're not going to

729
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:30,560
have the same impact as you do with if
you do all those things so I guess my my

730
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,640
call to action here is that you know you
can build one of these things yourself

731
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:38,900
if you want to you know it's not going
to look exactly like I described here

732
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,240
that's okay you know it's going to look
like your company in your your process

733
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,229
your perspective but you can definitely
build on these you know you know on the

734
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,740
one

735
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:53,870
so with that here's my contact
information you can use my email you can

736
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:59,420
find me on twitter as well talking about
these types of things quite a bit but i

737
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,380
would love to take some questions here I
left us a good when I was not only ipad

738
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:08,930
up a good five ten minutes or so for
questions so I love to educate much i'm

739
00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:11,930
gonna stay away from the camera so I can
repeat the question - yes sir

740
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,950
yeah i mean i think that's a flawed

741
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:32,129
you know I think I think that's
definitely a flawed because then the

742
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:32,790
next round

743
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,640
unfortunately the next round to get
pushed to you know I've seen that happen

744
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,730
so many times where you know what will
this do it in the next release

745
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,350
we promise uh-huh yeah you promised and
then the next one then we will we try to

746
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,170
push it out again because we had this
other customer thing happen so that's

747
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:49,410
how I would answer that's how I would
fight back against that that type of

748
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:53,069
concern is to say well no I don't really
think you're gonna you know you want to

749
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,310
sign a contract so you're going to give
me 50 grand if you don't then they're

750
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,520
gonna be like know why is that well
being Republican to push it

751
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:03,180
it's a prayer

752
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:27,869
nope

753
00:47:32,609 --> 00:47:47,790
wow yeah i mean that's that's what I've
seen in program but I built in the past

754
00:47:47,790 --> 00:47:51,060
it's like I said developers are not
monsters right they're not they're not

755
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,920
that it's not that they don't want to
know

756
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,700
they just have nobody's told them taught
them the lessons and once you teach them

757
00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:00,540
those lessons and that light bulb goes
on there changed forever right

758
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,720
we are all in this room because we know
once you get into security there's no

759
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,230
get now right it just changes your
mindset your perspective

760
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:10,109
you look at things differently you know
you start threat modeling when you're

761
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:13,049
walking in the airport you know looking
at all the different potential problems

762
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:17,010
that can exist so so yeah i think it's
it's it's definitely true that they're

763
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,010
never going to say that I've never heard
anybody say that but

764
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:24,319
they don't have to say it to the there
that their code and whatnot backs up the

765
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,319
fact that it's not going to them

766
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:36,078
yep

767
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:40,939
yeah that's good . thing it'sit's you
know raise that awareness level raise

768
00:48:40,939 --> 00:48:45,769
that knowledge level and then then you
can go at people that are just a

769
00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:49,008
pathetic and sad and then the people
that don't care will start to rise up to

770
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:51,949
the top because they'll be the ones that
have the most of all abilities and their

771
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:53,239
code

772
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:56,539
any other questions

773
00:48:56,539 --> 00:49:22,789
okay well I'm gonna go here first well
from a from yeah I didn't have no i

774
00:49:22,789 --> 00:49:26,239
haven't had any any like from a
competition perspective where it became

775
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,709
a problem i had people trying to trying
to sneak stuff in the system that was a

776
00:49:30,709 --> 00:49:31,788
bigger problem

777
00:49:31,789 --> 00:49:35,179
more of a fraud they're putting in
activities that were actually doing

778
00:49:35,179 --> 00:49:38,809
because they wanted to get to the next
level when we had to kind of investigate

779
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:44,209
them and and had one guy who posted all
of the answers to the white belt that

780
00:49:44,209 --> 00:49:49,219
his entire group and he actually had the
audacity to say what

781
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:52,789
this is a problem what are you kidding
me right

782
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:56,809
of course it's a problem you can use you
just you know completely circumvented

783
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:59,809
this whole thing so yes I haven't had
any real negative

784
00:50:00,709 --> 00:50:06,319
you know I've had some add some negative
perceptions from the metaphor

785
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:09,799
perspective because i'm a we made some
decisions

786
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:15,709
we use some imagery that we didn't even
realize was offensive to some people so

787
00:50:15,709 --> 00:50:19,009
it wasn't on purpose so that HR
department got involved and looked at it

788
00:50:19,009 --> 00:50:22,429
and gave us a ruling and they said you
know you're not really blame because it

789
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:25,430
just did not we didn't know we just use
this artwork and didn't realize it was

790
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,578
offensive so that was probably the
biggest problem I've ever had and we

791
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:31,520
could easily correct that though by
saying we're gonna going to fix

792
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,630
we're just gonna change the graphics we
didn't mean to offend anybody process it

793
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:38,630
was not a question over this one

794
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:56,390
so the roles definitely so you know I'll
from everything that I've seen you have

795
00:50:56,390 --> 00:51:00,410
to you know if you have to target the
training that the information towards

796
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:03,290
what the person does right people know
there's nothing people hate more than

797
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:05,720
having to do some training it doesn't
apply to them

798
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,930
so it has to be tailored towards what
you want you know what you're what

799
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:13,009
you're looking for them to do the
internal certification thing that's a

800
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:16,250
you know I've stayed away from that in
the past

801
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:21,349
I'm only because of the cultures that I
was in there that what you have to be

802
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:22,579
very careful with is
