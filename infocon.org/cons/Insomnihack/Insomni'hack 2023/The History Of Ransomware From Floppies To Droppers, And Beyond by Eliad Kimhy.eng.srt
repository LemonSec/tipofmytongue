1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:05,279
that's enough all right thank you so

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:07,080
much let's move through this

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,940
presentation

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,980
um so the evolution of ransomware from

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:13,080
floppies to droppers this was uh my

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,700
clever pun

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:15,540
um

8
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,160
today we're going to talk about some

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,220
stories this is Story Time with Grandpa

10
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,320
uh about all the way from the first one

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,019
or how they evolved and uh what has

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:26,220
changed and maybe we can learn something

13
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,099
along the way so first thing is a

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:30,539
question

15
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,079
stay on your feet uh when was the first

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,340
ransomware

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,800
if anybody knows

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:42,019
you can scream the answer

19
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,899
89. yes

20
00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:48,239
1989 was the first ransomware and it's a

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,100
little bit strange because we're all

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,879
thinking about ransomware nowadays and I

23
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:54,960
think there's some people in the

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,980
audience that weren't born before 1989

25
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,199
so to know that the first ransomware is

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,539
older than you or maybe some of your

27
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:07,200
children is probably a kind of a weird

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,760
thing to realize

29
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,880
but the first one was 1989 but actually

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,979
I all of these dates are kind of like

31
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,020
little Easter eggs in the history of

32
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,220
ransomware

33
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,220
but this was the first ransomer the AIDS

34
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,920
Trojan or and its other different name

35
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,920
is the AIDS information software and

36
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
this was the brilliant idea of a guy

37
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,439
called Joseph L Pope and Joseph L Pope

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,020
had this amazing thought he was kind of

39
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,759
uh working on computers and he thought

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,439
well if I can

41
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,799
if I can write this virus that locks

42
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,299
people's computers

43
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,240
and then I could send this virus to them

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,759
and I can make them open it

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,659
um

46
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:50,640
and lock their computers and then I can

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,920
ask them to pay

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,899
maybe I can make a ton of money like

49
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,119
step there's somewhere as a question

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,820
mark in between and then profit so he

51
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,799
figured it out he thought this is going

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,360
to be a brilliant idea and he actually

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,680
did it

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,880
so

55
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,860
Joseph L Pope

56
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,220
decided one day he was gonna buy a ton

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,560
of floppy disks and he was going to put

58
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,660
all the floppy disks in envelopes and

59
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,280
he's gonna lick the envelope put them in

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,200
the mail and send them to a whole bunch

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,580
of people

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,940
and then if they put their uh this

63
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,819
floppy disk in their computer uh there's

64
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:29,700
gonna be either the the virus politely

65
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,700
asks them to turn on their printer

66
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,920
um because we're fancy and it would

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,319
print out a ransom note uh you know

68
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:39,599
because it's kind of the old today's and

69
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,640
on the ransom note it would say please

70
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,239
send 378 dollars to a PO Box in Panama

71
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,800
genius

72
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,019
two birds in one stone he goes He

73
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:53,519
collects the money in Panama and he can

74
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,000
go on vacation which is great and I

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,860
thought about this for a while I like

76
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,420
this story it's a very interesting story

77
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,160
but also I thought about this it's kind

78
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,220
of there's three parts to this scam and

79
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,680
I thought it was interesting that all of

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,080
these three parts actually kind of are

81
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,140
relevant for modern ransomware so I want

82
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,120
to analyze the evolution of ransomware

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,800
through in the context of these three

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,260
parts of what he did so let's talk about

85
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,540
what he actually did

86
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,420
when they caught him spoiler alert when

87
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,300
they when they caught him they found 10

88
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,840
000 floppy disks in his parents house

89
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
um

90
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,640
and which is crazy so the delivery

91
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,080
method that this mentioned wasn't this

92
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,159
is 1989 was to take floppy disks and

93
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,680
send them by mail this is probably the

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,319
most difficult way to spread malware in

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
existence

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,659
um

97
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,580
but he was determined

98
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,099
and he was able to do that and he was

99
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,720
able to send all this and you have to

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,840
ask yourself how did this guy uh get all

101
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,220
the addresses of the people that he

102
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,379
wanted to send it to well I think

103
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:05,400
already we can find the first uh example

104
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,620
of the connection between this old

105
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,659
ransomware to the modern ransomer of

106
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,420
today because this was called the AIDS

107
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,840
Trojan and

108
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,139
the the fact that he relied on this very

109
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,800
important virus at the time in the 80s

110
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,479
was this form of social engineering

111
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,280
right because we see this today right

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,139
there was a recently there was a big

113
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:29,520
virus if you guys I don't know if you

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,620
guys have heard past three or four years

115
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:35,759
it was kovid and there was a lot of

116
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,400
different social engineering scams that

117
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,340
used this to trick people into opening

118
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,960
um different different scams different

119
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,240
phishing different attacks

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,120
um so Joseph Al Pope 30 40 years ago

121
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,520
figured okay what I'm going to do is I'm

122
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,800
going to call this the AIDS Trojan the

123
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,139
eight information software and I'm going

124
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:58,020
to send this to AIDS researchers so

125
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,060
there would be these Business magazines

126
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,919
where there would be lists of people

127
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,139
addresses and he decided he's going to

128
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,540
send this to AIDS researchers which is

129
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,520
pretty mean if you if you think about it

130
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,800
like these are people trying to save the

131
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,100
world from an epidemic and this guy is

132
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,060
is is a jerk and so that's that was his

133
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:19,979
sort of method of of doing that and I

134
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,000
think it's interesting social

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,979
engineering has probably existed long

136
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,139
before the internet but it's always good

137
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:27,360
to be remembered to remember that the

138
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,160
encryption that he used I mean today we

139
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,419
know that encryption is pretty

140
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,759
complicated but he was very simple

141
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:35,100
encryption it was symmetric encryption

142
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,860
I'm not an expert in encryption but it

143
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,900
was a very simple substitution Cipher

144
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,560
you just kind of uh change the order of

145
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,240
the letters or you kind of move the

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,520
letter up the alphabet in some direction

147
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,220
and basically you change uh change up

148
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,740
the letters that was pretty much what he

149
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,520
did and it's very simple to unencrypt it

150
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,979
it was very simple to treat it but it's

151
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,699
1989 what are you going to do like send

152
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,400
send a letter to your local infosec

153
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,100
expert like there's

154
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,240
there's nothing you could do about it

155
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,180
which was again he was a big jerk but

156
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:12,780
um

157
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,100
they

158
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,259
the interesting thing was and I think

159
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,440
this was again a sad thing is that there

160
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,660
were a lot of researchers that lost a

161
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,160
lot of their work because when their

162
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,620
computer froze up you know what do you

163
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,819
do when you don't know what your

164
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,819
computer is doing right now

165
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:32,220
down you've turned it back on you try to

166
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,100
format you try to you so there were a

167
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,740
number of cases where people lost

168
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:41,819
years of AIDS research and actually some

169
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,560
of these details are are the details

170
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,840
that are going to bring to to his

171
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,780
basically his demise uh this this man

172
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,300
and finally the business model my

173
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,240
favorite part of this scam sending cash

174
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,520
to a PO Box in Panama

175
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,699
it's so brilliant that it was stupid and

176
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:03,060
he I mean a PO box if you open a P.O box

177
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,639
you have to put your name on there and

178
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,620
um that was the first

179
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,600
uh the first thing that kind of got

180
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,940
these the the authorities onto him so

181
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,419
they figured out there was a man whose

182
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:18,180
name is Joseph L Pope they figured out

183
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,199
this guy is is uh causing AIDS

184
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,759
researchers to lose their research and

185
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
they decided to do something about it

186
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,780
and of course they didn't catch him for

187
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,639
a long time because

188
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,800
nobody cared about computer crime back

189
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,699
then

190
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:34,440
but when they did catch him they caught

191
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,180
him in Amsterdam

192
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,460
and he was just kind of wandering around

193
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,479
there

194
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,460
caught him at the airport and they

195
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,960
brought him to the judge

196
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,660
and it actually turned out the guy was a

197
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,520
little bit crazy

198
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,560
and he would put like curlers in his

199
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,500
beard and he would wear like weird hats

200
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,199
and the judge was like well poor guy you

201
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,580
know

202
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,860
this is like like craziest thing I've

203
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,560
ever heard with the floppy disk it was

204
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
1989 nobody cared

205
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,940
um so they let him go

206
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,800
laughs

207
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,900
right so

208
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,580
40 years ago nobody cared about

209
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,759
ransomware today we would probably

210
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,479
destroy this man's life

211
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,620
but

212
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,840
I think this is an interesting

213
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,940
way to look at the evolution because we

214
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,160
have these three things

215
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,500
so let's try to focus on each one of

216
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,919
those things

217
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:32,700
told you there's going to be stories

218
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,700
that was the first one

219
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,719
okay so I want to talk about the

220
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,679
encryption

221
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,159
how has encryption evolved

222
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,279
Joseph L Pope this first ransomware ever

223
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,740
created was very very simple

224
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,260
it's it's one of the most basic types of

225
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,000
encryption you can create you just kind

226
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,959
of change around the letters

227
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:56,339
that's not what's going on in ransomware

228
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:57,839
today if you're

229
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,640
weren't wondering

230
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,560
but I want to do a little detour because

231
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,399
I like history and I like stories and um

232
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,620
before we go all the way I think the the

233
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,540
history of the encryption in ransomware

234
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,420
is is fairly straightforward so I'll

235
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,040
take you on a different Journey

236
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,420
and um in 2010 there was this trend of

237
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,820
screen lockers

238
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,220
um because

239
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,720
cyber criminals figured out what's you

240
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,060
know what's easier than

241
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,640
um encrypting a malware

242
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,519
not encrypting a malware and still and

243
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:33,899
telling you telling the victim that

244
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,820
they're they're locked so what would

245
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,459
happen is something like like this uh

246
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:40,920
you would get a message from the FBI and

247
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,220
and the CIA and the Department of

248
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,080
Homeland Security and they would tell

249
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,940
you that you committed a terrible crime

250
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,459
and you're going to go to jail for many

251
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:54,920
years unless you give us 20 bucks

252
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,740
if you pay twenty dollars it's all good

253
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,839
you know it's whatever

254
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,899
um so they did that and uh that was kind

255
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,060
of I thought was kind of interesting I

256
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,279
mean it's just kind of a very pure form

257
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,980
of social engineering you know

258
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,980
um but the interesting thing is is it

259
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,620
did work in some cases

260
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,160
and there's even a story of somebody who

261
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,040
turned themselves into the FBI there was

262
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,440
a 20 year old man in America who turned

263
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,720
himself in because they thought

264
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,339
um that they they were on to him and I

265
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:32,399
think he had some some bad files on his

266
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,580
computer

267
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,440
and so he went and uh went to the office

268
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,120
and they were like what the hell are you

269
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,680
talking about and he's like I brought

270
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,160
the 28 anyway but he was yeah he was

271
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,320
locked up and that's the story of screen

272
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,640
lockers I thought that was pretty

273
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,100
interesting this just a little bit of a

274
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,680
detour that I wanted to include here but

275
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,579
really this

276
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,680
of encryption like I said I think it's

277
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,140
it's pretty straightforward because

278
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,720
encryption even in the days of Joseph Al

279
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,740
Pope

280
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,079
we knew about better types of encryption

281
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,120
right these three men

282
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,480
um Rivas Jamir and Adelman are RSA they

283
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,700
created the the mathematical algorithm

284
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,339
of of uh asymmetrical encryption again

285
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,200
I'm not an expert

286
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
kill me later if I'm saying anything

287
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,579
wrong but uh they created this

288
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:23,100
mathematical algorithm of how to encrypt

289
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,380
something in an asymmetric way so that

290
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,920
you can lock something up

291
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,600
um and then you can have a different key

292
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,420
to open it up so uh if you're for

293
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,579
example writing a malware you can have

294
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,160
the the locking mechanism on the malware

295
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,800
but you can have the unlocking mechanism

296
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,420
with you so then you can send it to

297
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:45,540
somebody to open it up basically

298
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,820
um so that it existed it was just a

299
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,380
question of how to transfer to the world

300
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,540
of computers or how to put it on on a

301
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,940
software and it took a while for it to

302
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:56,040
actually come in to the world of

303
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,019
computers but

304
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:01,440
this is interesting because in 1996 and

305
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,839
by the way they're the RSA algorithm was

306
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,360
somewhere in the 70s but in 1996 this

307
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,600
paper was written and it's just I love

308
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,700
how like these are academics you know

309
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,579
and they're like they're just like

310
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,320
they're they're like thinking of all

311
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,000
these different terms and they're like

312
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,800
write these papers and basically all

313
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,540
they're doing is like well what if you

314
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,360
could encrypt the software and then you

315
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,399
have to pay something so that's what

316
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,019
they did

317
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,600
um they invented ransomware technically

318
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,820
in an academic paper and all they did

319
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,200
was they said well what if I could lock

320
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,880
your computer with some kind of malware

321
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,160
somehow I get it to your machine and for

322
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,899
you to open it

323
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,480
um you will have to pay me some kind of

324
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,519
e-currency because

325
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,320
they didn't know about Bitcoin they

326
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,180
thought e-currency would be some kind of

327
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,060
money in the future it was the 90s it

328
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,980
was cyberpunk you know everybody thought

329
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,079
the future would be cool nobody

330
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,620
predicted the existence of Dogecoin

331
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,700
um

332
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,980
but you know they were like I eat money

333
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,320
and then we're so brilliant we we've

334
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,720
discovered ransomware but they did

335
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,760
actually and it would take another 10

336
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,000
years for actual encrypting ransomware

337
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,820
to show up on the scene

338
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,060
this is the first RSA encrypted

339
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,459
ransomware that I could find

340
00:13:25,459 --> 00:13:27,839
and I read a lot

341
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,820
but that's the first one I could find GP

342
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:32,339
code in 2006

343
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:34,860
you would get a raisin resume or

344
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,660
something some kind of job application

345
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,600
and if you open the file and then you

346
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,660
would get encrypted and you know

347
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,700
in the beginning there was a lot of

348
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,519
effort like Collective effort to try and

349
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,040
break these algorithms because if you

350
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,220
use a low enough sort of um bitrate for

351
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,100
the the encryption again I'm not an

352
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,760
expert shoot me later uh you know with

353
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,339
enough processing power back back in the

354
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,620
day you could actually get get over it

355
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,139
but then as I kind of researched this I

356
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:08,779
would see sort of the desperation

357
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:11,279
growing so people would kind of

358
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,019
collectively put their computers

359
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,160
together to try and break the encryption

360
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,440
until the encryption got more and more

361
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,540
complicated and they just couldn't like

362
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,579
there was no amount of computers in the

363
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:24,300
world

364
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,579
that could unencrypt which was kind of a

365
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,139
sad moment and you can still find these

366
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:29,700
like Forum posts and all these

367
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,040
announcements like oh please let's get

368
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,440
all of our computing power together so

369
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,839
we can stop this threat and

370
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,060
um at some point it got just too

371
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,100
complicated and I think this is an

372
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,199
interesting fact because I think

373
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
still today I think we're in a situation

374
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,760
where encryption is very very

375
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,180
complicated and not very easy to decrypt

376
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,000
and it's not like there's no cases ever

377
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,839
of decryption of malware right sometimes

378
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,139
we this it does happen law enforcement

379
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:05,940
sometimes works sometimes rarely or in

380
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:08,519
the case of uh Babu for example that was

381
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,940
a ransomware where the allegedly the

382
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,260
person who created it got terminal

383
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,860
cancer and they wanted to

384
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:20,040
I I don't know if it's true or not we'll

385
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,720
take it we'll take it seriously we

386
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,360
wanted to die a better person and they

387
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,300
release the the source code and when

388
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,740
they release the source code you could

389
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,959
probably go in and try to decrypt it so

390
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
it happens but I don't think it happens

391
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,220
well enough and so when I think about

392
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,560
this evolution of encryption when I

393
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,940
think of all the evolution I try to

394
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,500
think about

395
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,240
um where are we today and what's going

396
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,860
to happen in the future

397
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,519
and again not an expert but I'm not oh I

398
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,860
don't think that the the whole part of

399
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,560
encryption uh is going to be solved

400
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,079
anytime soon so it's almost like I think

401
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,300
about it like picking a lock you know

402
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,459
you have these three tumblers that we're

403
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:02,339
talking about and for attackers I think

404
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,019
at least the encryption one is kind of

405
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:06,839
set in in a pretty good place I don't

406
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:08,540
think that's that's where we're going to

407
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,079
succeed but maybe I'm Maybe I'm Wrong

408
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:14,880
um the only other thing with encryption

409
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,160
was that attackers are now exfiltrating

410
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,079
the data and they're doing a lot more

411
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,880
than that and there's everybody's

412
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,860
inventing new new types of extortion

413
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,300
every day there's double extortion

414
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,100
triple extortion

415
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,100
quadruples sold you know it's like okay

416
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,019
but the the exfiltration is pretty

417
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,519
serious

418
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,040
um so you you can lock the files you can

419
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,380
also steal the data and that's not the

420
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,759
type of encryption but I thought it was

421
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,680
worth mentioning

422
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,600
so we're all the way get caught up on

423
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,880
the history of encryption

424
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
so next thing the business model I

425
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,440
wanted to touch a little bit on the

426
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,579
business model

427
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:53,220
it is full of bad ideas

428
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,079
starting with the worst idea in the

429
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:59,779
world the Panama uh Panama money scam

430
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:01,740
but there has been a lot of different

431
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,779
ways how do attackers monetize like

432
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:06,000
throughout history how do you get paid

433
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,160
when you create these scams I think that

434
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,780
that is a very important part of the

435
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,199
history of ransomware because without

436
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,480
this part I don't think ransomware would

437
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,760
exist this is a super super important

438
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,079
part

439
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,000
um and in the past there were all these

440
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,339
really crazy ideas

441
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,260
um starting with gift cards and prepaid

442
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,240
debit cards this is something that still

443
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,100
happens I think you know these types of

444
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,240
scams

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,880
um this one is interesting the the FBI

446
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,820
one would actually open your webcam and

447
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,220
freak the out of you

448
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,240
um

449
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,940
I I would probably get scared but the

450
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,280
debit card is such a silly idea I mean

451
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,080
what are you gonna do send them like 25

452
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,860
bucks on a it's it's so stupid you can't

453
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,780
really collect a lot of money like

454
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,419
imagine imagine trying to Ransom a

455
00:17:54,419 --> 00:17:56,940
company well don't imagine

456
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:00,539
do good stuff but if you were to imagine

457
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,520
imagine trying to get like a hundred

458
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,160
thousand dollars in Ransom with debit

459
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,980
cards there's no way but

460
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,620
then we got the E currency the

461
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,140
electronic currency which is also stupid

462
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,419
idea because

463
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,720
uh these were traceable and so these led

464
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,940
to the capture of a lot of these these

465
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,679
uh or not a lot but led to the capture

466
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:26,820
of criminals this wasn't a good uh idea

467
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,660
either

468
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,700
and it was a little bit complicated so

469
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,000
there was still brainstorming you know

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,280
um another interesting one was the

471
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,980
premium phone calls SMS you you kind of

472
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,900
have to send a message to some phone

473
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,120
number and it pays the attacker you get

474
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,419
your code kind of similar to to and I

475
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:46,620
think there's still scams like we

476
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,140
recently did research about uh um

477
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:52,679
malware mobile malware that's spreading

478
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:55,620
around in Europe called flu Bots look it

479
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,340
up

480
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,100
and uh still you know malware uses the

481
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,720
ability to send messages and text

482
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,419
messages not necessarily to these these

483
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,460
types of phone calls again this might be

484
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,780
traceable

485
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,299
also an interesting thing notice that

486
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:10,860
this is in Russian

487
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,100
I hope it's in Russian but I think it's

488
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,440
in Russian and uh you know for a long

489
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,000
time as I was reading about this this

490
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,620
was ransomware was considered something

491
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,660
that was happening in Russia

492
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,080
and sort of moving to the West which I

493
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,360
don't think anybody considers today to

494
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,820
be well nowadays it's coming from Russia

495
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,720
but it's

496
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,880
existing in the west

497
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,320
um back in the day it was only a problem

498
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,780
for them all right spoiler alert you all

499
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,260
know where we're going with this Bitcoin

500
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,140
Bitcoin was the

501
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,160
key that unlocked ransomware uh this is

502
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,160
called crypto Locker crypto Locker was

503
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,340
the first one of the first if not the

504
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,299
first uh ransomware this was 2013

505
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,179
started using Bitcoin and I think that

506
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:02,280
is really where

507
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,679
um the ability to run some people was

508
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:05,940
unlocked

509
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,919
um it was all thanks to

510
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,440
this man

511
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,860
lucky one two three four five six

512
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,380
that was his name he was sort of the

513
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,179
Ring Lord of of uh this game over Zeus

514
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,299
botnet and he this Mr Lucky this

515
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,059
businessman as you can see he is very

516
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,340
successful

517
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,100
um all thanks to his ransomware and

518
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,720
botnet efforts

519
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,419
um so they this was kind of one of the

520
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:38,580
first uh collaborations where you know

521
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,520
Zeus I don't know if you know this was a

522
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,580
Trojan was a banking Trojan and botnet

523
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,760
and then eventually it uh distributed

524
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,980
ransomware and it distributed this

525
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,080
ransomware was the biggest collab of

526
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,480
2013.

527
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,400
to the detriment of all of us but this

528
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,799
is also kind of the first uh I would say

529
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,320
one of the first ways that this business

530
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,440
model started to grow of

531
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,799
um these organized crime groups it was a

532
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:09,960
very well organized group they kind of

533
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,120
had a lot of slave devices on their

534
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,980
botnet and they were able to encrypt

535
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,100
them and take the money again ransomer

536
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,500
used to attack just regular people and

537
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,000
take you know

538
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,280
two Bitcoins the hundred it was used to

539
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,660
be like a hundred or two hundred dollars

540
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,120
so this is that guy

541
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,900
um

542
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,240
actually they they tried to shut his

543
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,059
Butner down operation Tavor sorry Tovar

544
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,620
and

545
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,480
um they weren't able to catch him so he

546
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,320
still

547
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,020
somewhere out there with this cat

548
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,039
okay

549
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,260
here's the interesting thing

550
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,940
talked about the encryption and I think

551
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,620
the encryption is pretty well set we

552
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,900
talked about the business model I think

553
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,460
Bitcoin is not something we're going to

554
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,720
solve anytime soon it's you know it's uh

555
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,020
um it's Anonymous it's hard to trace you

556
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,900
can transfer a lot of money there uh you

557
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,340
know it's everything that you would want

558
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,980
as a cyber criminal so what about the

559
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,419
delivery and I think this is where

560
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,780
things are pretty interesting

561
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:11,220
so the delivery

562
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,780
this is the interesting thing about

563
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,059
delivery that we're going to find out

564
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:18,840
the delivery mechanism doesn't evolve it

565
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,880
just kind of builds like a like a layer

566
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,380
cake of of vulnerabilities it just grows

567
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,460
and grows

568
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,580
everything old is still relevant today

569
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,159
but I think the the sort of the delivery

570
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,860
mechanism started with the sneakernet of

571
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,659
the old days of sneaker net just like

572
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,220
the shoe the sneaker that's what they

573
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,200
used to call it it's when you take your

574
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,299
floppy disk and you walk over to your

575
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,740
friend's house and you put it into their

576
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,640
computer

577
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,360
it was so ineffective and slow that

578
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,100
people didn't believe that viruses

579
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,840
existed right like there's there's all

580
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,480
these articles and letters

581
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,059
um about viruses the the they were like

582
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,919
a myth and people talking about them

583
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,260
like they didn't exist but viruses did

584
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,000
exist back then and they were pretty

585
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,320
interesting

586
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,000
and there's a lot to kind of read about

587
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,520
it but that was the first delivery

588
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,820
method when you think about it if you

589
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:15,059
have a problem hacking uh to an

590
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,240
organization even today

591
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,900
um

592
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,360
sometimes the easiest way is to put on

593
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,360
an I.T t-shirt and a USB stick and just

594
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,220
to walk into the office and to try and

595
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,559
just do it physically so this

596
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,240
technically still something that might

597
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,740
work but

598
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,200
after the 90s

599
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,380
in the late 90s mid 90s this is the

600
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,659
Golden Age of hitting the fan uh

601
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:45,620
we have Windows 95

602
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,299
office

603
00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,679
flash all these things just full of bugs

604
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:55,320
full of holes and it's it's what I love

605
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,440
about this is if you've heard of Melissa

606
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,539
the Melissa virus very famous virus from

607
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:02,880
the old days does anybody know what type

608
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,780
of virus it was

609
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,299
so actually I think it was a macro virus

610
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,440
I believe it was defined yeah even here

611
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,120
it was a macro virus

612
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,559
and that was back in the in the mid 90s

613
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,440
um does anybody knows macros macros

614
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,179
that's the the brilliant idea that

615
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,220
Microsoft had they were like okay we got

616
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,919
this office you can write on it what if

617
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,539
we give you this ability you can write

618
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:32,220
commands you can automate the whole

619
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,299
thing

620
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,640
and then it can also write commands to

621
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,700
the machine and um

622
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,679
and they expected everybody to use it

623
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,720
legitimately

624
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:47,159
um but actually this was this was became

625
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,380
the most dominant type of virus and and

626
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,860
sort of the mid 90s because people would

627
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:56,100
use it to infect things I mean I guess I

628
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,720
guess that was 30 years ago right so a

629
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,320
lot of things have changed since then

630
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,640
Microsoft Office

631
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,299
um doesn't run macros automatically it

632
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,000
asks for your permission to run them

633
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,120
a whole lot has changed but if uh so

634
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,340
actually macros macros are still used

635
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,480
all the time for for attacks you get a

636
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,580
document like a Word document in your

637
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:23,580
email address and if you enable macros

638
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,620
the macro would run a code and then

639
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,020
would run some code like Powershell or

640
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,400
something like that and it would

641
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,020
initiate the attack

642
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,080
so it's good to know that 25 years later

643
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,960
still haven't solved the problem

644
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,059
um also spam emails I mean I guess spam

645
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:40,799
emails ever since the email was created

646
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,900
you've got spam emails this is part of

647
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,480
you know a precursor to

648
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,260
um phishing emails and exploit kits

649
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,700
so you know flash was sort of the

650
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:56,340
original swiss cheese oh for Switzerland

651
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,460
the Swiss cheese of vulnerabilities it

652
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,640
was it was full of uh full of bugs and

653
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,520
and would constantly get abused

654
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,500
um and it doesn't exist today but

655
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,760
there's still plenty of things that

656
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,740
could get abused uh when when you go

657
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,220
online in the form of exploit kits

658
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,260
kind of moving forward in time we'll

659
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,600
come back to all these things later the

660
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,700
2000s a lot when I was reading about

661
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,320
2000s there was a lot of like

662
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,720
downloading things this was when all

663
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,380
these file sharing uh software Kaza and

664
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,840
all these were very very coming kind of

665
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,419
becoming very popular and you would be

666
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,279
downloading your favorite Britney Spears

667
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,539
song

668
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,900
and instead there was some virus

669
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,260
somebody wrote and would ruin your day

670
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,679
um so I guess the the lesson here is is

671
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:51,299
always by the music uh never steal

672
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,700
but I guess we all did it

673
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,279
um so there was kind of a vector that is

674
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,440
still relevant today but I kept reading

675
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,940
about this is something that was a

676
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,760
threat in the mid 90s and I mean sort of

677
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,299
in the 2000s but 2010 I think is where

678
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:10,080
kind of it all came into its own and

679
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,179
kind of the focal point there were a

680
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,520
couple of things that were that came

681
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,400
sort of together around that time that

682
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,880
are very very relevant today so Trojans

683
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,860
in the form of banking Trojans and other

684
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,900
Trojans that was a software that was

685
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,480
created to basically infiltrate your

686
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,480
computer try to read your banking uh

687
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,140
credentials and try to take some of your

688
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,760
money log in and try to take some of

689
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,279
your money these originally were called

690
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,700
banking Trojans and aimed at at

691
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,679
these devices but eventually developed

692
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,720
into more complex things is if you can

693
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:48,240
get into somebody's computer you could

694
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,220
probably do a lot more and a good

695
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,100
example of that was our friend with the

696
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,340
cat who developed a Trojan called Zeus

697
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,039
or game over Zeus eventually became game

698
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,419
over Zeus

699
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:03,000
Nets were also a thing that was just

700
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,799
kind of coming into its own and again

701
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,860
the ability to spread not just through a

702
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,600
network but to spread across the

703
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,760
internet create these slave devices and

704
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,620
then send commands to them and then do

705
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,600
whatever you want with them was also a

706
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,299
very important thing because like I said

707
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:19,919
it's like a layer cake all of these

708
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,360
things kind of come together when you

709
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,240
think about a modern ransomware attack

710
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,980
because modern ransomware attacks

711
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,500
nowadays are kind of created is sort of

712
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,500
as multi-stage attacks you might get an

713
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,860
email that email might contain a

714
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,460
document if you run it and you're you

715
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,039
enable the macros for whatever reason it

716
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,659
would run a code

717
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:46,559
so our macros from the 90s and then uh

718
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,360
you know whatever warming capabilities

719
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,580
you would find in a warm or a botnet or

720
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,500
anything like that would then help you

721
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,320
move laterally the Trojan would help you

722
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,299
establish persistence and so on and all

723
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:59,279
of this just kind of comes together of

724
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,380
course there are they're all evolving in

725
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,760
their own way

726
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,679
from generation to generation but

727
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,039
there's there's kind of a presence in in

728
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,840
modern attacks

729
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,020
um so that that's sort of modern

730
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,640
delivery you spread through the network

731
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,039
you do your best to get to the entire

732
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,960
network and then you deliver your

733
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,520
payload and your payload might be a

734
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,000
ransomware so the delivery

735
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,520
is not something that so much evolved as

736
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,799
it just compounds and it will probably

737
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
continue to compound

738
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,059
um even though of course new

739
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:34,679
vulnerabilities are discovered every day

740
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:37,380
but even when we do research today

741
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,200
vulnerabilities from five years ago

742
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,840
seven years ago like uh

743
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,820
Eternal blue is still being abused out

744
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,399
there so it's it's not like you have to

745
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:50,700
have the newest vulnerability to to be

746
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,679
successful or exploit the newest

747
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,120
vulnerability you just have to exploit

748
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,340
the one that nobody's patching against

749
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,260
so

750
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,779
that's where I got to with the delivery

751
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:03,120
that's what I'm thinking about but I did

752
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,260
want to kind of leave you with uh some

753
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,419
something a little bit more I don't know

754
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:11,340
educational

755
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,740
um probably not but you know where do

756
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,899
where let's summarize all of this right

757
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,659
so from floppy disks in in mailboxes

758
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,080
we're now looking at modern attacks

759
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,659
um with many many stages and with

760
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,179
encryption from symmetric encryption we

761
00:30:27,179 --> 00:30:29,039
see a lot more complicated one with the

762
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,200
business model cash in the mail we're

763
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,779
finding very complicated businesses now

764
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:35,279
that are working on the other side of

765
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,880
the the fence with customer service

766
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,679
departments and all sorts of weird

767
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,059
things

768
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,799
and I think

769
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,860
when I think about

770
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:49,860
where we're going to find this this uh

771
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,559
moving forward and where we find the

772
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,320
most opportunity to disrupt the

773
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,840
adversaries or disrupt the the attackers

774
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
is of course in the delivery the

775
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,340
delivery is going to continue to evolve

776
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,960
and we're going to continue to try it

777
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,299
and disrupt them and so I guess the

778
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,100
question is

779
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,860
if I had to leave you with any kind of

780
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,260
thought

781
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:16,679
um don't think about ransomware as

782
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,679
ransomware it's not the encryption

783
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,360
mechanism that you're defending against

784
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,539
most of the time although you can try to

785
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:27,179
to defend against encryption with some

786
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:30,419
Canary files or honeypots whatever

787
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:31,320
um

788
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,919
think about it expand it open it up to

789
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:37,500
the entire attack that that it is think

790
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,720
about what are the places you can impact

791
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,140
it I know I'm not creating a crazy new

792
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,940
idea here

793
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,039
um but think about where you can stop

794
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,159
them where there's before they infect

795
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,220
whether it's during because they're or

796
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,380
during lateral movement wherever you can

797
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,840
try to disrupt them is where you should

798
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,580
put yourself

799
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,980
um and that's it that's that's my entire

800
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:05,159
story for today and if you have any

801
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:08,840
questions I'll be happy to answer them

802
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,140
foreign

803
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,990
please let me know
