some projects the first project program

48
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,120
was create uh before the covered it was

49
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,280
the name is Tech Fortress this is a

50
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,860
booster for startup so if you have a

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,500
project if you want to create your

52
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,660
project because we have an ID just come

53
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:54,120
to us and we can discuss to go to the

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,860
market because what we have seen in this

55
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,620
region is that there is a lot of many

56
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,940
many very strong and very good Community

57
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,000
with a lot of expertise technical

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,340
expertise but sometimes they need to

59
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,980
have the go to market so it's what we

60
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,040
have done with our startuper and we want

61
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,800
to share that to you

62
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,099
we work also in um in with the smes so

63
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,379
you will see some our software are now

64
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,900
involved in our

65
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,980
um program dedicated to smbsm is so it's

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,659
for that we open for them some

67
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:33,180
possibility some business opportunities

68
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,440
to work with smes also with corporate

69
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,640
um next with cave Studio of this huge

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,519
program it was really a pilot the first

71
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:46,319
year we thought that it was very

72
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,720
difficult to find

73
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,019
10 startup and we we found 15 startup

74
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:54,599
for the first edition and now this is

75
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,180
the fourth edition and we have more than

76
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,280
100

77
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,760
startup supported and it's nearly 50

78
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,640
percent come from Switzerland all all

79
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,840
the counter and to to Zurich Bern on the

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,459
wolf Russia and Geneva and also we have

81
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:15,480
now

82
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,199
um a lot of startup come from foreign

83
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,820
country it's 40 40 also

84
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,680
more than 50 partners and more than 200

85
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,639
million Rays by our portfolio so what we

86
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,440
have seen since the beginning of the

87
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,419
journey with the tech Fortress it's

88
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,940
really uh at the beginning it was really

89
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:42,419
difficult for for a cyber funder to fund

90
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,180
to raise funds to find the phone to find

91
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,639
a good investor the market is really

92
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,300
time reading now so uh I think it's it's

93
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,240
really a huge opportunity for you also

94
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,880
to to go in this cyber entrepreneurship

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,400
the value of the offered by the program

96
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,300
is nearly as 100K and uh yeah on the

97
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,979
budget

98
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:07,080
okay

99
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,780
Best in Class cyber security starter to

100
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,960
whisk out all uh all the the all the

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,620
year we Scouts with the help of epfl but

102
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,400
also with private sector and also uh

103
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,780
with uh with the Contour and also with

104
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,720
the Army we work with armasis some of

105
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,000
you maybe know the Cyber defense campus

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,419
they help us to have a good scouting and

107
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:35,460
we start this kind of expertise I will

108
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,979
not read all the the word but I'm sure

109
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,720
that you you have seen this candle what

110
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,180
we are looking for we opened this year

111
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,460
two new

112
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,220
um vertical relative to digital

113
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,960
governance and P stack uh why because we

114
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,539
have now one activator uh just happened

115
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:58,800
last at the end of last year in the new

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,380
campus name limit first dedicate to

117
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,900
economy of trust and cyber security just

118
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,180
close to really close to Sigma company

119
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:12,360
and we will open also a new trust

120
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,960
Village in the same mood in Geneva in

121
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,120
aquilo or Arjun and we will Scout about

122
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,340
peace Tech because we need we think that

123
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,380
it's really a market to open with that

124
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,259
and also about Quantum at this time what

125
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,419
we have seen with the startup come from

126
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,560
account time it's uh it was yes I think

127
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,560
we can raise the number of of the

128
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,020
startup in Quantum

129
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,840
in the field we work a lot with space

130
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,940
smart cities agritech aggregates

131
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
foreign

132
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,400
have one thing in common

133
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,860
and I'm talking about intrusion sabotage

134
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,100
Road data leakage and so on

135
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,380
they were made possible because sometime

136
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,380
in the past something changed in the

137
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,699
information system

138
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:23,280
and the impact of this change was not

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,520
assessed or completely understood

140
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,919
a new service was exposed but the

141
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,599
configuration of your vulnerability

142
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:34,440
scanner or IDs has not been adapted

143
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,419
a person moved within the organization

144
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,099
and started accumulating toxic

145
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,440
combination of access rights

146
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,180
a new version of the email client has

147
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,620
been deployed on the workstations and

148
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,280
you don't have the right controls on the

149
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,500
DLP agent or the endpoint protection

150
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,060
system

151
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:54,380
those things happen in real life

152
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,960
whatever your level of maturity in terms

153
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,060
of cyber security whatever the budget

154
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,340
the tools the people the process is in

155
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,340
place that's the real life

156
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,979
so what can you do about it

157
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,979
can you perform a complete in-depth risk

158
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,860
assessment for every single change

159
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,699
obviously it's not economically viable

160
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,759
my name is and I'm the CEO and founder

161
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,680
of conitex where we provide the

162
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,960
technological solution to this issue

163
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,740
or platform will Monitor and watch and

164
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,840
detect the pertinent changes in your

165
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,539
information system and assess its impact

166
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,000
in terms of risk and compliance to your

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,419
policies so that's we immediately detect

168
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:42,179
whenever you're in a situation where the

169
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,459
risk is higher or whenever there's a

170
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,700
violation of one of your policies

171
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,860
and as we are able to do that we are

172
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,800
also able to simulate the impact of a

173
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,160
change that you that you plan to do

174
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,620
this is how we help our clients to

175
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,560
achieve truly

176
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,480
agile risk management and continuous

177
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,000
compliance without slowing down

178
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,980
innovation

179
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,650
thank you

180
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,660
[Music]

181
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:15,319
thank you

182
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,560
do we have some questions come from this

183
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
is the Monaco

184
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
or not yet okay

185
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,240
okay so uh uh what are your USP

186
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,300
yeah USB yeah um well the the USB is

187
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,519
really uh the real time aspect because

188
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,680
we are really monitoring the the all the

189
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,040
information continuously and the fact

190
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,160
that we make it super user friendly to

191
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,459
the end user that we target we are not

192
00:09:49,459 --> 00:09:53,580
dedicated to uh technical Engineers we

193
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,620
are really targeting a population of

194
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,200
Risk Managers in your managers that want

195
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,320
to use and have a vision on on the

196
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,560
situation and be able to use it without

197
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,600
having a training or without having some

198
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,760
complicated stuff to do or develop code

199
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,459
or whatever

200
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:14,040
and is it more for large companies or is

201
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,620
it depending on the level of security of

202
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,560
data that you need to have or what it's

203
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,140
from the smes to the biggest companies

204
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,660
because obviously to have that kind of

205
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,760
system in place you have to have a

206
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,500
certain level of maturity in terms of

207
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,580
data so that addresses smes and more

208
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,680
yeah so it could be also SMS then yeah

209
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,500
okay

210
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,399
okay no question

211
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,680
okay so thank you so much thank you

212
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,590
okay

213
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:46,920

now

217
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,000
uh software developer on machine

218
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,779
learning specialist at Clear Sky

219
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,420
you hear me yes yes

220
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,760
have you ever considered how easy it is

221
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,940
for hackers to clone your voice

222
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,579
it takes them just a sample of three

223
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,980
seconds to build your vocal Avatar and

224
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:17,640
make you say whatever they want

225
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,279
now imagine what they can do by stealing

226
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,980
hours of recordings from board meetings

227
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,600
or medical consultations

228
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,920
confidential conversations need more

229
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,440

and structure documents locally without

234
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,140
the need for an internet connection

235
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,880
with clear mind you don't have to worry

236
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,680
about taking notes anymore

237
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,839
you can focus on the conversation you

238
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,180
are having and our technology will take

239
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,740
care about

240
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,899
extracting and summarizing key

241
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:03,540
informations for you saving you time and

242
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,220

we already already tested our solution

245
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,579
in several clinics around Switzerland

246
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:14,760
doctors are reporting improved focus on

247
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,820
their patients and up to 40 percent of

248
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,480
their time saved by using our technology

249
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,060
particular mind is not just for doctors

250
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,980
we are testing it in the legal domain

251
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,500
and our team will be more than happy to

252

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,880
private conversations as well

254
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,980
so if you are interested in this kind of

255
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,100
Solution please meet us at our booth and

256
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,579
sign up for a demo

257
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:46,380
CTO clear sky thank you for your

258
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,620
attention

259
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,240
thank you thank you so much

260
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
just maybe one question I'm I have the

261
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,160
feeling that what you said is that it's

262
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,860
processing a conversation to extract

263
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,380
useful information what's the link with

264
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,440
the uh protecting the the audio or from

265
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,920
from fake uh so we're doing your voice

266
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,320
or so the our solution is limiting the

267
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,899
surface of attacks that you can add by

268
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:14,880
being completely isolated for from

269
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,899
internet

270
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:18,779
so if someone want to steal your data

271
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:20,459
you have to have physical access to them

272
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,860
but in any case we are of course adding

273
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,860
having encryption Solutions on the

274
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,579
device so this is our solution okay

275
00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:31,380
thank you some questions come from

276
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,860
Monaco

277
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,200
and so maybe while we're waiting for the

278
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,120
questions from Monaco you said that like

279
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,279
yeah of course medical information is

280
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,260
interesting and you talk about the legal

281
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:53,279
one uh any other domains where sectors

282
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,779
where it could be interesting so there

283
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,700
is the law enforcement

284
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,360
um where the positions the clients

285
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,019
people can go to the lower person

286
00:14:03,019 --> 00:14:05,839
both meetings is another segment we are

287
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,100
investigating at the moment

288
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,320
yeah

289
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720

across multiple value chains our

301
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,160
technology at the moment is in more than

302
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,160
70 countries and used in different

303
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,360
verticals like Pharma

304
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,519

contraficting contrain creates uh losses

307
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,579
in the range of hundreds of billions of

308
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,000
dollars per year and impact societies

309
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,940
and individuals and companies in

310
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:12,120
multiple ways but most importantly 10

311
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,839
dangers human life and in the recent

312
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,860
years we have noticed the rapid increase

313
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,139
in contrafitting partially due to the

314
00:15:24,139 --> 00:15:28,139
pandemic and the increase in online

315
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,160
trade and also with the emergence of

316
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,320
digital Technologies Multiverse and

317
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,740
blockchain we have the Contra fitting

318
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,320
appearing as well and and growing in the

319
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,620
digital world my name is Dan milanovich

320
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,300
I'm the CTO of altena and together with

321
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,459
my colleagues in otina we are trying to

322
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,040
solve this and we are working hard to

323
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,579
solve this problem of uh

324
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,920
contravated products and traceability in

325
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,560

328
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,040
we provide traceability into inticity

329
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,480
platform as a service and

330
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,480
this all also infrastructure free so our

331
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,820
technology provides a possibility to

332
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,100
track products on the single product

333
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,000
level to collect interaction from end

334
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,519
users of the products to make a bridge

335
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,800
between

336
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,260
physical and digital products and also

337
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,360
to provide the real-time monitoring of

338
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,880
location and environmental conditions of

339
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,120
monitored products and I'm very proud to

340
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,420
say that we are the first Swiss company

341
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,880
who this year on the world mobile

342
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,160
Congress won the global mobile award for

343
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,079
this technology that provides bridge

344
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:58,860
between uh physical and digital products

345
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,820
thank you I'm at the tech trust boost

346
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,919
boot later if there are interested if

347
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,959
somebody is interested to to meet and

348
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,190
talk I will be there thanks a lot

349
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:14,280
[Applause]

350
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,140
so maybe one question is concerning the

351
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,720
uh it seems quite a huge infrastructure

352
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,819
you need for that so any uh proof of

353
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,299
concept or uh already uh customers using

354
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,040
the solution right now yes we have

355
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,020
multiple customers as I mentioned

356
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:30,799
through in several Industries in

357
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,559
Pharmaceuticals in uh luxury sector

358
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,320
perfumes in food and beverage wine

359
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,900
production and in sports as well

360
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,120
okay good

361
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,700
okay

362
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,700
uh

363
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:03,910
[Music]

364
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:07,220
and then

365
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,679
well that's a very good question thanks

366
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,700
for that we have actually multiple uh

367
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,900
let's say parts or or devices which can

368
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,539
do both can follow let's say the

369
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,539
products with the thing with the fast

370
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:27,539
life cycle so to say but also longer

371
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:31,500
life cycle products and also reusable

372
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,380
traceability Solutions when you talk

373
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,600
about the life cycle management this

374
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,020
bridge between the physical and digital

375
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,820
products becomes interesting because

376
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,220
then you can have these smart contracts

377
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,880
in the digital world which follow

378
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,700
uniquely physical product and can sort

379
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,400
of facilitate

380
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,140
management of its transformation through

381
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,860
the life cycle

382
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,720
thank you very much

383
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,840
thank you very much antenna

384
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,100
okay next one

385
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,559
to another way so I know

386
00:19:21,559 --> 00:19:24,900
let's imagine that you're a hacker

387
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,679
you are in the dark side of cyber you do

388
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:30,720
it for a living so you need to be

389
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,620
efficient you need to be productive what

390
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,520
will you do first to attack a company or

391
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,418
an organization

392
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:44,240
no ID

393
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,039
if I am a hacker the first thing I will

394
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,260
do is I will look at the statistics

395
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,440
eighty percent of attacks will leverage

396
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,500
human vulnerabilities right from the

397
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,179
start of an attack

398
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:58,860
so

399
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,160
and this human vulnerabilities what are

400
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,700
this what all what are they they are all

401
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,640
the private information

402
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,860
of collaborators of VIPs of a company of

403
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,299
an organization

404
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,299
so you just have to just to have a look

405
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,580
at the social networks at The Forum of

406
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:26,940
accuracy on the deep and dark net and

407
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,460
you will find you will be able to find a

408
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,460
lot of information to create social

409
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,940
engineering phishing attack

410
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:36,780
etc

411
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,220
etc

412
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,220
what we do at another way is we change

413
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,820
the game we want to prevent this initial

414
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,780
step

415
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,320
so we have created a dashboard in order

416
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,460
to assess the risk for everyone in a

417
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,260
specific organization

418
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,200
so we have an entry point the email

419
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,059
address for instance and we will gather

420
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:01,760
a lot of information

421
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,400
about that risk and so that we can have

422
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,039
a scoring about their risk

423
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,260
in a second step

424
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,900
for the people at risk we will provide

425
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,200
an individual web app

426
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,740
for anyone to have a look at his own

427
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,360
exposure

428
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,020
so and with this web app you will know

429
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,299
exactly your exposure your level of risk

430
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:32,820
you will be able to add your personal

431
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,000
data to know if you have a leak on your

432
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,620
Gmail address or if you are exposed if

433
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
your phone number is exposed and then

434
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,720
you will be able to remediate that we

435
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,640
will give you some advice we will give

436
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,940
you some correction in order for you to

437
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:53,580
remediate these vulnerabilities

438
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,260
so basically

439
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:58,740
we change the way we approach uh

440
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,039
cyber security prevention we address the

441
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:04,320
human factor in a different way

442
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
so we change this approach thank you

443
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,059
thank you and

444
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:15,360
I'm happy to receive your questions so

445
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,100
you mentioned the market all they say

446
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,919
the the customer base is it more

447
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,539
companies or it could be directly

448
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:24,120
individuals no interested in knowing

449
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,280
more about their their attack surface

450
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,840
and so so today we we work with uh with

451
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,260
uh Enterprise with companies

452
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,299
um but we've seen that for instance in

453
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,220
the US and Canada we are starting

454
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,320
expansion there

455
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,419
um Whenever there is a leak in the

456
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:43,380
company

457
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,240
the company to avoid class actions

458
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,600
will propose various tools so antivir

459
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,760
virus and so on and so forth and

460
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,840
potentially

461
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,640
and our application for their uh for

462
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,320
their employees

463
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,860
so at a certain step we will go to the

464
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,440
b2c market

465
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,340
but today it's B2B and we can work as

466
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:15,500
well with uh b2gov for certain specific

467
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,120
environment and protection

468
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,440
we won the uh Forum International Silver

469
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,159
security price this year and we are

470
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,340
starting to work for the joseon Epic the

471
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,460
milvanchat in Paris

472
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:34,919
with the ministry of Ontario

473
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,800
okay thank you thank you so much

474
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,039
[Applause]

475
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:43,940
one question from Monaco

476
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,840
yes

477
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,740
together only

478
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:06,179
okay

479
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:08,539
thank you

480
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,080
so good question so basically we

481
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,200
supervise uh data leakage data leaks for

482
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,559
instance on the dark web and uh whenever

483
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,320
we have customers we are gdpr compliant

484
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,400
so we do this when we have customers

485
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,880
we do look at their social networks on

486
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,000
demand then based on their uh on their

487
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,400
action on their own action so it's real

488
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,100
time we gather information from the

489
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,960
various leaks from the various social

490
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,360
networks

491
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,159
okay a second question from Monaco I

492
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:44,880
think

493
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,260
is right

494
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,799
yes

495
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,919
cherry

496
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,529
[Music]

497
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,220
indeed yes okay okay so thank you so

498
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,590
much thank you thank you and as always

499
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:14,478
[Applause]

500
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,900
okay next Saturday

501
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,760
welcome on stage

502
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,418
foreign

503
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,500
billion of events were there

504
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,279
this is the average number of events we

505
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,179
are collecting for a midsize company of

506
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:43,260
let's say 1 000 workstations to get a

507
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,960
unified vision of cyber security and

508
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,059
observability

509
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,179
we speak about 12

510
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,580
000 events per second

511
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,120
to collect in real time to ingest to

512
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,120
store and to transform into actionable

513
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,159
insights

514
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,580
real-time data is becoming the fuel of

515
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,200
cyber security

516
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,320
but it's also becoming a main issue

517
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,919
because it's growing exponentially

518
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,039
this is the main reason why so many

519
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,760
historical CM Solutions are no more able

520
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,080
to do the job

521
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,980
and also why the most powerful Solutions

522
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:30,179
are becoming so crazy expensive

523
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:33,659
this is exactly the reason why a leader

524
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:37,559
like crowdstrike two years ago decided

525
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,220
to get rid of very famous Solutions

526
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,659
to buy a company called umio because

527
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:48,179
umio was one of the very few companies

528
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,539
that built its own data processing

529
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,279
technology

530
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,279
the good news is that you don't need to

531
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:59,460
buy a company anymore because we are

532
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,760
coming with a disruptive solution

533
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,299
so at Kim Yahweh our Swiss company and

534
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,179
we are very proud to develop the first

535
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,900
AI powered data Factory that is breaking

536
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,840
the complexity and the cost of real-time

537
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,000
data analytics

538
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,440
to do this our platform is able to be

539
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,760
connected to any kind of data source and

540
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,760
at the same time in real time the data

541
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,900
is prepared for an immediate usage

542
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,919
what was so complex and so expensive is

543
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,980
done now 10 times faster and with 10

544
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,340
time less resources

545
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,419
I'm Felipe CEO of fat kimya and I'm very

546
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:51,659
happy to be able to make your cyber data

547
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,020
science dreams come true

548
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,799
thank you Philippe

549
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,419
so you you talk about

550
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,760
um let's say data connectors so it it's

551
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,000
mainly for iot or workstation or what

552
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,120
type of devices you you when I said that

553
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,580
we can be connected to absolutely any

554
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,880
kind of data source it's the case

555
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,039
structured or in structure of data iot

556
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,919
sensors everything you want and you

557
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:25,799
spoke about usb we are very proud about

558
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,640
your our Universal connector because it

559
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,360
seems to be a first worldwide invention

560
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,179
and the the efficiency of our Universal

561
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,000
connector is just amazing

562
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Monaco

563
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,760

564
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,179

maybe we can begin with some question

605
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
for for our starter

606
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,740

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,140
okay perfect thank you

608
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,360

um the the

610
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,679
let's see the the other startup or they

611
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:19,260
presented themselves just before you've

612
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,899
went through this stage so you were a

613
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:25,140
few um let's say steps further

614
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,360
um how does it feel

615
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,279
you mean like the

616
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,799
sorry the next stage yeah the next stage

617
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,720
it was like more doing the running

618
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,580
through the accelerator program from

619
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,220
from chess Valley and now you are that

620
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,340
is a follow-up yeah okay first of all

621
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,480
I'm really amazed that there's so many

622
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,460
people because thanks a lot for coming

623
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,740
first I was not thinking that we were

624
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,299
gonna have so many people so thanks a

625
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:48,960
lot

626
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,340
don't go because there are people

627
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,820
actually leaving or not okay

628
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,520
um yeah I think you know it's being like

629
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,380
uh it's been like um I mean like

630
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,760
everybody is doing a startup you know

631
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,200
this is a while right right it's going

632
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,240
to be a lot of things I think uh being

633
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,460
part of a program is essential first

634
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,840
start you should do a startup I think it

635
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,659
perhaps is the best way to start you get

636
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,120
yourself into a program get some coaches

637
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,480
mentors uh get get into the um

638
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,240
I mean the network and that's that's

639
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,620
that's that's going to give you some

640
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,720
some boost I mean not all programs

641
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,320
obviously are worth your time uh this is

642
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,600
a good one but uh but also like for

643
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,820
instance like we we are like a part also

644
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,120
a program like in New York and uh after

645
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,039
half time you decide uh this is really a

646
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,720
waste of time and so it was something

647
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,580
with the NYU Stern so we think oh that

648
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,679
may be good but down with part of the uh

649
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:42,480
the one in the fintech lab in Accenture

650
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,760
in London which is unbelievable so you

651
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,340
have to pick your bottles uh battles not

652
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,940
bottles uh and

653
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,460
um yeah I think this is a good way to to

654
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,120
move forward yeah

655
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,880
maybe a question

656
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,620
for you Philip we are very pleased to

657
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,380
have you on stage uh you are Syrian

658
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,340
entrepreneur but also a papa because we

659
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,799
don't have her Olivia on stage but this

660
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,899
is a startup at the beginning of the

661
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,559
Olivier areas your son and your two sons

662
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,200
are involved I think in in the startup

663
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,700
could you give you more information

664
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,600
about that or or how to become a cyber

665
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,500
entrepreneur sure yeah sure yeah for me

666
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:31,679
I I have created a lot of companies so

667
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,519
far

668
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,500
nine to be exact in my life it's 35

669
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,940
years so no merit okay so and the last

670
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,820
one because I'm here to speak on behalf

671
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,580
of Sapporo

672
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,500
it's the most extraordinary for me

673
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,000
because

674
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,059
I did it with my two sons so you can

675
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:57,380
imagine what that means

676
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:01,799
so I'm very proud of that for sure at

677
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:04,559
the same time I have educated my son to

678
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,019
become an entrepreneur one day or

679
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:07,919
another

680
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,679
and this is what was happening in

681
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,980
variety not just for Sapporo because for

682
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:17,159
the two sons is not the first one

683
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:21,418
is for the the older one the third and

684
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,580
for the younger the second

685
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,719
so uh so yes it's something which is

686
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:33,060
very important and how because what we

687
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,760
need to speak how to become a cyber

688
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,260
entrepreneur so

689
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,739
you can become a psychological

690
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,460
by Family usage who is my example

691
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,940
for example I mean and but also by

692
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,899
chance

693
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,879
by opportunity

694
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,619
but whatever

695
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:55,699
in order to succeed you need to have

696
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:59,820
step by step an environment

697
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,880
that we make you successful the first

698
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,359
one is to have the good idea

699
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,540
however the question from the audience

700
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,660
what is your unique selling proposition

701
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,760
it's not easy to respond to that

702
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,420
question right but it's based on an

703
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,380
Innovative idea first for sure you need

704
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,140
to consider what exists already what

705
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,500
doesn't exist why you can do better you

706
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,140
need to be confident into yourself but

707
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:34,619
it's not enough after you need to build

708
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:37,560
the first prototype and then build a

709
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,960
little team a small team at the early

710
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:42,540
stage with people you trust

711
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,520
and then you need people like them

712
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,540
around not just the Fortress but also

713
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,839
innovo and many other things that data

714
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,700
duvu can bring on the table

715
00:35:55,859 --> 00:35:59,160
you can acquire the visibility if you

716
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,619
consider support for example we have

717
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,260
been very proud to win the first prize

718
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,900
last year for sure that increased the

719
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,780
visibility of the company to be chosen

720
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:13,680
as the best cyber security solution

721
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,000
but then

722
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,119
it's not just enough and after you need

723
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:21,540
to have the funding to success I know

724
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,720
that not all the company here need need

725
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,180
fund but most of the time you will need

726
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,880
funding so you need to to use the

727
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,579
visibility that bring textile tests to

728
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,440
get the right funding this is exactly

729
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,500
what support did and after that you need

730
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,579
also to get customers which is the

731
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:45,000
resting and not the easiest thing to get

732
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,960
so that's just me maybe I just want to

733
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,579
know you're talking about just customers

734
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,320
it's interesting and also about the fact

735
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,540
that you've had quite a lot of uh

736
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,180
successful startups so what is the

737
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,480
difference maybe I'm I'm almost sure uh

738
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,640
over 35 years that the previous one were

739
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,339
not cyber startups so do you see any

740
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:08,220
difference between between a traditional

741
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,460
startup or or a cyber one or what needs

742
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,460
to be done there or no there is big

743
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:15,540
difference

744
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,060
there is a big difference this is the

745
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:22,260
cyber security segment is crowded

746
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:26,520
Androids or thousands have not come that

747
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,040
exactly exist on the market so you can

748
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,160
hear every day including today customer

749
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,040
visiting using

750
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,800
we have so many so many solutions so the

751
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,660
net is because we don't have too much

752
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:42,119
time and I don't want to keep the speech

753
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:45,960
too much is okay if you want to acquire

754
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,760
a new Innovative solution you need

755
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,220
to keep out a solution that you already

756
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,800
bought in the past because that's the

757
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,380
route for all the customer I don't buy

758
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,320
if I don't stop the subscription of all

759
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,579
the other or it could be a new a new

760
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,280
demon no yeah but so maybe uh Aurelia

761
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:10,140
have you have you seen also that type of

762
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:11,000
like

763
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,619
overcrowded potential customers Market

764
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,720
or with competition or

765
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:19,740
yeah I mean it depends uh on on your

766
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,839
side we are more on the data protection

767
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,280
Parts uh especially about regulation uh

768
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:29,400
we work a lot with gdpr with regulation

769
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,920
with European companies and uh in

770
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,440
Switzerland we work with the new LPD

771
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,960
regulation and

772
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,420
um in Switzerland we don't have so much

773
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,960
competitors on this specific uh

774
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,980
regulations issues uh so for me it's a

775
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,520
little bit different but in in Europe

776
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,960
yeah

777
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,300
there are a lot of companies doing that

778
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:57,420
but generally in the in the tech and in

779
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,880
the cyber security we can see a lot of

780
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,220
of companies working on different

781
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,619
subjects and yeah I mean

782
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:07,079
I I can understand it's quite hard to be

783
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:09,060
visible on the right way and you you

784
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,339
talk about your product around gdpr or

785
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:13,740
things like that so why Switzerland and

786
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,280
not being raised in Europe uh so uh what

787
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,960
is more what is it more interesting why

788
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,520
is it more interesting to be around here

789
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,040
well first of all because I'm living

790
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,760
here so yeah and um

791
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,859
just to to explain a little bit about

792
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,800
myself and my background I was working

793
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,380
in a company here in Switzerland jail

794
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:38,700
near Geneva in a startup but inside a

795
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,060
big I.T company

796
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,839
and I left this company five years ago

797
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:49,800
to build my own startup uh thanks to my

798
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,119
clients they push me in this way and uh

799
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,180
I when I found my company I already have

800
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,420
clients so it was a big chance for us

801
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,599
and that's why I mean our

802
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,180
markets here is so important for us

803
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,820
because we are already a network and the

804
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:11,700
trusts of our clients I mean it's the

805
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,040
more the most valuable thing in our

806
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,680
company we can create Tech we can get a

807
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,200
program that's at the end of the day

808
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,839
what is matter is the trust that your

809
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:25,500
client give to us to you

810
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,240
okay uh I I know you you don't like that

811
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,940
I I told about this story but I will do

812
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,119
because we are in Australia so it's I

813
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:39,300
hack your your slot and uh I just want

814
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,839
to talk about oh it's possible to found

815
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:45,839
to to find found and to find a good

816
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,839
investor and could you tell more about

817
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:52,140
your story with wigman and what's uh

818
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,540
what's uh what happened with them okay

819
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,960
yeah obviously finding finding money is

820
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,599
the first thing right and also I think

821
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,160
uh you need to take money when you

822
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,260
create a company because you're not I

823
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,520
mean like started because you're not

824
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,500
creating like an SME you're creating a

825
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,180
company that needs to be fast so that's

826
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,220
what you need to raise money more money

827
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,380
that you can make with customers that

828
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,420
you can grow faster what a deep and the

829
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,220
main issue I mean the main point for

830
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,599
that is because you're doing something

831
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,839
Innovative so if if you wait too too

832
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,300
long and you're trying to grow like uh

833
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,900
like uh you know moms and pups or like

834
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,060
you know nothing against smes but like

835
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,320
it's it's a different just business

836
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,579
model so I think it's very important

837
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:34,560
that you keep in mind that you have the

838
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,500
time to Market is critical especially uh

839
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,900
when you want to raise money so so so my

840
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,339
experience is that

841
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:43,380
I was I was fortunate enough that it was

842
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,500
my second startup and uh and I sold my

843
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,680
first started to Snapchat in 2016 so

844
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,960
then I have an earn out period and then

845
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
um

846
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,099
all places yeah well actually they asked

847
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,140
us to do oh I guess you moved to LA I

848
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,900
said well no way yeah you know I have a

849
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,200
kids uh two kids a wife a house so like

850
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,700
you know you're not ready and I lived in

851
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:10,440
I lived in the U.S for 10 years I lived

852
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,720
in New York and then I did Japan so I

853
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:14,160
was I was like okay that's enough for me

854
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,900
I want to you know raise my kids in

855
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,640
Switzerland so I said like okay so I'm

856
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,980
gonna um and eventually so they bought

857
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,780
us and uh and that was that was a good

858
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,640
experience obviously for for the you

859
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,980
know uh when you look for funding for

860
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:27,960
the next time you go to cvcs if you have

861
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,839
an exit wow that's you know it's kind of

862
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,500
a gold card entry uh politics so

863
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,480
obviously it makes it makes things way

864
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,839
easier right I need to be uh recognized

865
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:41,760
that if I didn't have an exit didn't

866
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,859
have to go because I basically went to

867
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:45,420
see only one investor I was doing one

868
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,380
Venture and um and so we raised uh 600

869
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,640
000 uh no customer uh just the MVP that

870
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:55,859
I coded with my partner

871
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:59,099
um and a guy who left Snapchat uh to to

872
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:00,359
come with me

873
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:03,180
and uh and uh so we raise that money and

874
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,560
then uh we we this is something else

875
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,420
don't expect yourself to pay much to pay

876
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,760
yourself much right expect to leave on a

877
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,680
shoestring like for the for the next

878
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,900
like two years right we literally I mean

879
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,640
I think if you do a startup like if you

880
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,260
want to have more than five thousand a

881
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,819
month it's not for you

882
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:24,060
so this is kind of a rule of thumb uh

883
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,640
everybody's gonna pay we pay about 5 000

884
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,040
a month which is I think okay in

885
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,859
Switzerland to to to live right

886
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:33,240
um obviously not you know you're not

887
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,800
going to go on vacation very often right

888
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,720
especially if you have two kids you know

889
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,780
why yes but but this is just life right

890
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,060
and but I think in for the adventure so

891
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:43,980
you have to find also people that that

892
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,380
are minded that they they agree on that

893
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,300
uh it could be perceived as a sacrifice

894
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,339
but to me I just think it's a it's a

895
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,319
great experience because building this

896
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:54,839
team is one of the the Crux of uh of uh

897
00:43:54,839 --> 00:43:56,940
creating a startup like the and then um

898
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,040
so we lived on that that shoestring for

899
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,980
about a year uh and and change and then

900
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,980
we uh I I could sell the the platform to

901
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:08,040
broadcom which is a global customer in

902
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:11,160
San Jose and then we raised uh then we

903
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,859
seen that it's uh investor and we raised

904
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:16,859
5.2 million last year but but one thing

905
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:18,359
that I learned because I didn't know I

906
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:19,380
didn't know this with my previous

907
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,180
startup is that

908
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,300
getting to VCS like every time you have

909
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,760
a step is the brand that you put on your

910
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,220
startup so it's really strategic I was

911
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,200
not ever aware of this I said well money

912
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,900
is money so so but actually this money

913
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,339
that is actually better than other money

914
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,579
and and you need to put uh kind of the

915
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:41,460
right stamp of which we see because if

916
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:43,440
you want to go next with the The

917
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,300
Benchmark of the world or this kind of

918
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,819
uh of investors they need to have good

919
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:49,680
VC so be very careful when you take

920
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,200
money from from people you have to be

921
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:54,540
very careful what it comes from and also

922
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:55,920
make sure that it's not something that's

923
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,140
going to impede your your growth yeah

924
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,480
it's really interesting and just another

925
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,280
question on only we talked about cyber

926
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,140
entrepreneur and and back also to the

927
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,480
questions have you seen any change in

928
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,579
the market between the your first

929
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:10,980
startup that is also about security and

930
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,720
you've changed in terms of money right

931
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,940
yeah use change absolutely like for

932
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,940
instance uh our pre-seed VCS they have a

933
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:21,960
fund uh uh that is basically uh just for

934
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,900
epfl student they have an idea which is

935
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,180
fantastic right they get like 20 20K and

936
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,700
you can just realize that idea and uh

937
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,859
which didn't exist before right and also

938
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,660
like wingman Venture the the precede

939
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:36,119
isn't it's very new pre-seat funding in

940
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:38,160
Switzerland it's really something that

941
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,839
for the last two three years when I did

942
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,280
my first start there was no such thing

943
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,680
so if you need like half a million which

944
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,260
seems to be a lot right but when you you

945
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:48,000
put like a team and you try to again

946
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,800
it's not going to be a lot right you to

947
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,060
create a product especially if you do

948
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:52,200
something that is complex with

949
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:55,319
infrastructure so but money is there and

950
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,880
uh and if you have a good idea if you're

951
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,240
remotivated I mean it's really possible

952
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,480
and you ask her 200k to two week man

953
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:05,720
yeah

954
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,220
200k because I think you know we have no

955
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,839
customer we have no and um we have no um

956
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:17,940
we have no product we just have the MVP

957
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,640
and literally we went to see these guys

958
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,640
and it said like well actually we wanted

959
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,579
that money in in October it was July and

960
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:28,680
this guy said well no you need the money

961
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:32,280
now and you need 600k and I say oh okay

962
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,859
for Sim dilution yes okay then let's go

963
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:37,940
right it's good so but again so I think

964
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:40,500
with the message that there there's

965
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,960
money to be allocated to to good

966
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,579
projects so you have a good idea I mean

967
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:47,400
this is definitely possible and maybe

968
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,560
about via the Switzerland and the change

969
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,200
in the market uh support is it are you

970
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:53,940
where you base already in Switzerland

971
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,319
for the previous companies or are you

972
00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:57,060
based outside of Switzerland

973
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,520
um the the two last one before support

974
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,960
was Swiss page too okay uh so next thing

975
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:07,319
was the first one uh you said it changed

976
00:47:07,319 --> 00:47:08,640
a lot

977
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,400
uh I don't agree that much

978
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,280
of my experience for example for next

979
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,880
thing I remember we had no product

980
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,260
the Prototype

981
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,280
even if we can call that a prototype but

982
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,560
uh I'm kind so you call that a prototype

983
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,079
and then we met

984
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:30,480
Venture incubator at the time which was

985
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,119
based in the pfl

986
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,800
and then Nicole

987
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:39,000
and that everybody knows obviously and

988
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,859
we discuss and I said we have nothing we

989
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:47,220
have no people we are just four people

990
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:48,720
in the company

991
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,780
and two developers and two in charge of

992
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,400
the business development

993
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,220
and they say yeah I agree but do you

994
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,160
have a customer interested I say yes we

995
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,540
have one

996
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,240
and easy ready to play something

997
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,220
whatever it is

998
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,339
to work with you you say yes but it's a

999
00:48:08,339 --> 00:48:11,760
little very few amount of money say

1000
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:15,060
that's fine it's a reference so yeah so

1001
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,040
it's a yes it's all reference and they

1002
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,400
say okay you can have 1.6 million which

1003
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,060
was for a pre seed round

1004
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,940
and at the same time you have also

1005
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,980
opportunities at the same time that

1006
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,040
today there is big money on the market

1007
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:38,760
but you can cry for 600 but between us

1008
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,300
what you can do is 600.

1009
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,500
not that much as you said so

1010
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,780
he changed and the same time it's always

1011
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:53,339
the same store you see maybe you need to

1012
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,920
to you need to choose the right one

1013
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,460
because a dollar is not a dollar I

1014
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,180
disagree on that

1015
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:09,359
in my life in my nine companies you know

1016
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,980
do I consider one better than another no

1017
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,500
okay what you can wait from Vision they

1018
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,440
say the claim will help you we will help

1019
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,540
you on the safe side on the business

1020
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,119
development no

1021
00:49:24,119 --> 00:49:27,420
no so there is some disagreement there

1022
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:29,040
um on the other hand you talked about

1023
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,839
having your customer or a potential

1024
00:49:30,839 --> 00:49:32,940
customer helping uh have you seen that

1025
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,040
Aurelia you you mentioned the fact that

1026
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,839
you you were let's say push to

1027
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:39,900
entrepreneurship by your your clients or

1028
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:42,300
actual clients so um so you had already

1029
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,579
the um the potential customer when you

1030
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:46,500
started there is it does it make a

1031
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,119
difference did it make a difference for

1032
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:48,900
you

1033
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,540
yes our client was very important at the

1034
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:53,940
beginning of the company uh because they

1035
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,880
trust us they can make the fact that we

1036
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,300
can pay ourselves and uh because we also

1037
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:03,240
have family so yeah we need to uh to be

1038
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,500
paid for for the work and um

1039
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,680
I mean

1040
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,300
money is a part they pay for the service

1041
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,000
but also the network opportunities they

1042
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,839
open to us was really important uh uh so

1043
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:20,819
from this point on the on this point

1044
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:23,160
it's very important for for us to to

1045
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,460
rely on the clients and um it's also

1046
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,680
really important to rely on specific

1047
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,079
organisms like frost value for example

1048
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:36,060
or Industries Etc uh we are alumni for

1049
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:40,560
the process season two and uh we gain a

1050
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,819
lot to be part of it uh to be honest we

1051
00:50:44,819 --> 00:50:48,240
learn a lot of things we create a strong

1052
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:48,840
Network

1053
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,680
[Laughter]

1054
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,160
and we uh also gain a

1055
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,740
a large amount of credibility on on the

1056
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:02,099
market and uh yeah I mean all these

1057
00:51:02,099 --> 00:51:05,160
points are really important alone it's

1058
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,099
not sufficient it's not it's not enough

1059
00:51:08,099 --> 00:51:13,500
but when you uh put all listing uh

1060
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,980
yeah you can take some value from them

1061
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:18,720
okay

1062
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,578

Microsoft let's go

1078
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:03,839
[Music]

1079
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:04,859
um

1080
00:52:04,859 --> 00:52:09,660
just go one step ahead try it I mean it

1081
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:13,380
was it and uh not it's not so

1082
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,319
complicated but don't be shy told quiz

1083
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,619
of their entrepreneur open doors stress

1084
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:21,800
Valley

1085
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,859
innovo inner Swiss you have a lot of

1086
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:28,200
opportunities uh to create but you have

1087
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,119
to create it by yourself

1088
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:32,660
yeah

1089
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,980
yeah I think the only thing I can say is

1090
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:35,880
that

1091
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,460
uh you not you need to be I mean like a

1092
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,500
team Builder it is all about the team

1093
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:43,319
right it's not going to be you it's find

1094
00:52:43,319 --> 00:52:45,300
the right people to to to work with I

1095
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,640
mean this is the thing also when you go

1096
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,800
to VCS they look at the team that's the

1097
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,300
first thing they look at they look at

1098
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,119
who's basically partnering right uh if

1099
00:52:54,119 --> 00:52:56,339
one man show never works

1100
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,339
I don't know anybody they invest in

1101
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:02,400
one-man shows three four people they

1102
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,260
sometimes a bit more difficult right

1103
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,540
because you know it's like a couple is

1104
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,180
like ideal so find a good partner find

1105
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,579
somebody to complement your skills I

1106
00:53:11,579 --> 00:53:13,200
think this is the first step really to

1107
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,380
create a company yeah thank you and

1108
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:19,440
Philippe I will be very sure because I

1109
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:21,300
completely agree with law

1110
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,760
most happens most people don't think are

1111
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,079
people

1112
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:27,660
the people you are working with which

1113
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,640
include your customers

1114
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,819
that you need to build the trust

1115
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:35,520
take for trust the name is not for

1116
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,800
nothing

1117
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,220
the world trust is the key of the cyber

1118
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:44,160
security startup the trust the trust

1119
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,800
between people inside and transmitting

1120
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,420
these stress out

1121
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,180
so that's the most apparently people

1122
