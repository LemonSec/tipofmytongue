1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,860
note speech of today thank you very much

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,200
thank you very much and it's a pleasure

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,840
to be here uh because it's uh great

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,599
audience a lot of experts here

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,099
um as he was mentioned we are very

6
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,900
pleased to invest in Switzerland

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,580
especially also in the cartonville I

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,140
think and participating also is the

9
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,640
Treasure Valley I think it's uh

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,279
definitely initiative that at Fortinet

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,800
we do see a lot of value here so and

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,019
Innovation start by startup so I think

13
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:30,840
there's a lot of a great idea that I

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,880
think we need to continue to go against

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,160
the massive challenge that we're all

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,140
facing from uh I'll say a cyber crime

17
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,960
perspective so um I'm not planning to

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,300
give you uh I will say a sales pitch for

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,160
a product speech because I'm sure you

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,780
may know the product and that's not what

21
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,140
you want uh we try to of course give you

22
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,260
a bit of uh what we do see globally as a

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,780
cyber security

24
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,760
technology leaders in and and more the

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,440
global perspective in terms of the

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,039
challenge uh how we in fact at Fortinet

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,739
we we try to go and help on on this

28
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,540
difficult Journey on fighting against

29
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,040
cyber crimes

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,080
and then providing a bit more detail

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,900
about how we collect and how we able to

32
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,240
provide the value and and that's about

33
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,299
the 40 watt Labs we have this kind of uh

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,280
Jewel inside the 48 which is not always

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,860
known uh and then more specifically

36
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,780
about the threat landscape uh talking

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,479
about the what's going on from at least

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,420
the data we collect in Switzerland and

39
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:32,880
what is the prediction at least that the

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,400
analysts that working for us are

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,159
foreseen in in the next feature and last

42
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,560
but not least it's talking about

43
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,000
collaboration because we

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
the vision that we have is that we need

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,280
to be all together from the end user

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
from the partners from the vendors like

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,360
us but from also the public and the

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,000
private to type and create an ecosystem

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,280
to fight against the cyber crime because

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,560
we need everyone and we need to act fast

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,780
and we need to be able to go against

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,180
them and not just be passive and try to

53
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,219
build a nice I will say protection it

54
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:06,899
will not be enough

55
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,220
so

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,560
starting a bit more with the uh let's

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,080
say the the journey in one hand you have

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,140
this uh significant challenge that uh

59
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,360
even in unfortunate better I'm sure that

60
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,220
all organization whatever is public or

61
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:22,680
private are facing so you have the CIO

62
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,020
or the CSO of the the organization they

63
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,239
are in kind of an infrastructure

64
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,300
Evolution so their task is to really in

65
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,459
fact evolve with this uh business

66
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,739
critical initiative uh such as the

67
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,379
second and connecting the world from

68
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,060
anywhere and that was of course

69
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,480
accelerated by the panemic as we have

70
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,760
all worked from home and that's becoming

71
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,459
like uh nor the standards so there's a

72
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,680
massive challenge here it's also

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
disrupted by the fact that uh the the

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,760
application has moved from the

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,819
Historical Center of the corporate

76
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,640
networks to now a more distributed uh

77
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,700
location and that can be the age or can

78
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,739
be the clouds which create of course

79
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,220
more complexity for the the CSO and the

80
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,860
IO to manage the data and to access the

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,519
data is also try to accelerate in fact

82
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,580
this digital transformation because we

83
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,700
the benefit is for company or public is

84
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,500
to of course be more efficient and be

85
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,900
more relevant so there's no other way in

86
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,060
fact to become in fact fully digitalized

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,819
which creates a lot of these challenges

88
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,580
and and uh and the last which is another

89
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,120
element we have seen in fact uh the need

90
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,459
for securing or oppression technology

91
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:40,260
environment or critical infrastructure

92
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,379
as they are converging with I.T and they

93
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,239
are connected and I'm sure you already

94
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,519
seen they are one of the most targeted

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,379
and fight environment because they are

96
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,840
very vulnerable using their old system

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,940
and easy to attack

98
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,340
so um that's a big Challenge from one

99
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,560
side which is really overall in fact the

100
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,680
big trends on the other side uh from the

101
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,959
let's say the attacker side we we see

102
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,659
the massive threat landscape that

103
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,480
continue to evolve and the Cyber risk is

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,239
escalating for all organization

105
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,700
as the cyber crime converge with

106
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,418
Advanced persistence threat methods the

107
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:21,238
Cyber criminal are finding ways to

108
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:24,060
weaponize new technology at scale

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,240
to enable more description and also

110
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,940
description and I'll share a bit some of

111
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,940
what the new attacks and what they're

112
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,280
using in fact to create this uh massive

113
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,919
impact on our networks and at the same

114
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,720
time they are spending more time on

115
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,360
recognitions of to attempt in fact the

116
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,540
evade detections intelligence and

117
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,360
control so all these means there is more

118
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,580
cyber risk and I continue to escalate to

119
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,740
the the Seesaw and we just need to be

120
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,460
very pragmatic move fast and try to of

121
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,460
course handle this challenge overall

122
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,199
so at Fortinet

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,240
um the we try to answer to this

124
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,220
Challenge and uh and that's one of the

125
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
challenge is the complexity because when

126
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,280
you look from what has been built for

127
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,919
the last 20 years we have been answering

128
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,500
by some of the new challenge by putting

129
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,259
a new technology with kind of try to

130
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,780
resolve the problem but that's trying to

131
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,060
a very very complex in fact security

132
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,220
network infrastructure which is almost

133
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,340
impossible to manage so there's a need

134
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,699
in fact for reducing this complexity and

135
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,800
and of course to support a bit with this

136
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,860
consolidation so by focusing on

137
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,160
consolidating vendors and point products

138
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
across both the security and the

139
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,160
networking

140
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,199
organization can reduce in fact the

141
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,660
complexity and to close the security gap

142
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,460
which are inherent to this previous

143
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,520
level say environment so and they can

144
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,720
improve

145
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,300
um operational efficiency they can

146
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,460
optimize user experience they can also

147
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,280
accelerate the outcome these three I

148
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,419
would say concept to achieve

149
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,060
consolidation are first the constitution

150
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,940
of networking and security into a secure

151
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,699
networking solution and we have seen a

152
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,220
lot of I will say uh the success

153
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,660
especially when you talk about

154
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,000
refreshing the age and there's a lot of

155
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,759
age on applying what we call the secure

156
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,979
sd1o Security Branch which is automating

157
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,680
in fact the the security and the

158
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,060
networking at the age without

159
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,539
necessarily having it experience

160
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:28,800
it's also consolidating the point

161
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,380
pattern into an integrated cyber

162
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,840
security platform and what we mean here

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,080
that's also a confirmed by Gartner with

164
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,940
the mesh architecture is really try to

165
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,520
reduce the the main core element of

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,860
course you need an ecosystem where you

167
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,960
can plug additional I will say solution

168
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,199
that can really fortify the entire

169
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,720
approach but there is now a big trend of

170
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,240
course and try to reduce this complexity

171
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
that has been built and then of course

172
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,460
is to also constantly applying in fact

173
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,280
threat intelligence into this kind of

174
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,620
secret services

175
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,080
and that's uh very critical because at

176
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,819
the end if you have systems that are not

177
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:11,340
updated on a daily or on our early

178
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,940
matters that the value is very limited

179
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:19,139
so as uh you know Fortinet uh tried to

180
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:23,039
of course uh uh uh evolve here uh and we

181
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
are cyber security leader in this space

182
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,319
just to give a bit of a perspective

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,419
um the company has sold about 10 million

184
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,300
network security Appliance worldwide in

185
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,520
almost like 90 countries so we are able

186
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,460
to use those security sensor to collect

187
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,740
data and feedback in fact all the threat

188
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,259
intelligence and uh and we're of course

189
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:46,380
going still at a very high pacing uh

190
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,240
while at a very big scale because last

191
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,520
year we did about 5.6 billion and we're

192
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,979
going at 30 so the need for this

193
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:55,319
consolidation and the platform is very

194
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,660
very critical but on top of let's say

195
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,599
the business aspect of Fortinet is also

196
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,599
our duty to help make the world safer

197
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,840
and more sustainable so and this is why

198
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,940
Beyond The Innovation and technology

199
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,419
that we provide we try to uh to reduce

200
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,759
some of the environmental impact and the

201
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,340
food print as well as try to address the

202
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,680
cyber security skill the Gap that we're

203
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,960
all facing and that's even coming with a

204
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,300
more Challenge and also try to Foster

205
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,460
the collaboration between the public and

206
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,699
private sector so on the cardboard

207
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:32,099
impact just because we continue to

208
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,099
develop specific I will say dedicated

209
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,039
Appliance like it's similarly to The

210
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,039
Graphic area but we are able to deliver

211
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,099
a very high throughput in terms of uh

212
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,640
security uh throughput for data center

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,040
leveraging or Isaac technology which

214
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,620
means less cooling less equities less

215
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,920
space so here we try to reduce the data

216
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,339
center carbon impact we also uh from the

217
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:01,380
beginning of our product chain building

218
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,480
in fact a much more sustainable in fact

219
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,480
environment so are we committed to be a

220
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,440
neutral carbon neutral by 2030. the the

221
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,500
skill Gap that we're all facing here

222
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,740
again

223
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,420
yeah it wasn't on the skill Gap we are

224
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,959
we have been creating in fact

225
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,360
an academy in fact back to almost like

226
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,060
uh 20 sorry was uh the NC that it's like

227
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,080
was back in

228
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,580
2010 and creating in fact the NSE

229
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,160
Academy and here the purpose was trying

230
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,080
to help in fact on this massive

231
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,839
challenge we do not have enough experts

232
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,000
like you and we need more we need to

233
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,220
create a vocation for young people to

234
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,820
embrace cyber security I will say career

235
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,980
and so we have built this NEC

236
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,779
certification where

237
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,880
um we we already certified more than a

238
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,519
million uh in fact people uh using that

239
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,339
and we of course continue to expand we

240
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:02,040
have multiple initiative especially one

241
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,899
with the world echoing from together

242
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,240
with the Salesforce e-learning platform

243
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,640
where we give for free in fact access to

244
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,640
this uh first two level of uh uh

245
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,920
Learning Journey and try to of course

246
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,399
create in fact more uh people joining uh

247
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,440
here at this space so and we will of

248
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,820
course continue on this space and last

249
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,560
mile is about the the threat

250
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,360
intelligence and of course engagement in

251
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,580
terms of

252
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,360
collaboratorying between the public and

253
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,980
private and inside the private so I'll

254
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,320
talk a bit more later on this aspect

255
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,240
talking about uh before going on this

256
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,160
piece and the visibility we do see from

257
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,980
a threats evolution in Switzerland a bit

258
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,140
more talking about how we are collecting

259
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,019
and how we uh are using in fact the

260
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,540
threat and intelligence here so 40 guard

261
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,519
Labs has been started from the beginning

262
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,579
of the company back to

263
00:10:55,579 --> 00:11:00,540
2006 uh and as I was mentioning they use

264
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,660
this uh 10 million Appliance as a sensor

265
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,600
to collect uh in fact data across all

266
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,980
the different GEOS and all the different

267
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,220
vertical and and departments and that's

268
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,140
really fueling in fact a lot of this

269
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,140
data we have about a bit more than 500

270
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,959
trade analysts that working and try to

271
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,959
of course Salvage this data but as you

272
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:24,540
can imagine this is not enough because

273
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,640
the volume that we do see on a daily

274
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,339
basis we are processing about 200

275
00:11:29,339 --> 00:11:32,820
billions trades events per days in the

276
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,339
401 lab so we are using of course

277
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:37,560
machine learning and intelligent

278
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,800
artificials to of course help these

279
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,760
threat researcher on Twitter in fact

280
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,779
evaluating all the volumes and be able

281
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:48,540
to deliver in fact the the services and

282
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,279
as you can see

283
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:50,820
um

284
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,040
we also collaborate in one side with

285
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,839
many others and try to share this

286
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,700
information because I think it's even we

287
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,920
have a nice I will say a collector of

288
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,560
system but others has also maybe a local

289
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,140
so the ideas that we can share and it's

290
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,600
not just the one way we really try to of

291
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,700
course use them in a belital way this

292
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,339
sharing information and we use all these

293
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:13,860
Tech this information to feed in fact

294
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,380
what we call the fabric which is our

295
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,600
platform and many element of this

296
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,279
platform are in fact using the the

297
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,440
technology

298
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,920
on on maybe just as an example uh since

299
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,560
the beginning of 14 RED Labs we have

300
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,720
been focusing on trying to discover zero

301
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,079
day attacks and all zero day program is

302
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,000
one of the most comprehensive in the

303
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,500
industry

304
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,480
um in fact it was since now almost 15

305
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,959
years and we have been following what we

306
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,079
call the responsible disclosure ethics

307
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,540
what we mean what we mean by responsible

308
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,880
disclosure is that we work with vendors

309
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,980
to fix the flow together before

310
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:56,339
malicious attacker leverage it and we

311
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,760
are about nearly from 1000 in fact zero

312
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,519
day attacks already from the the

313
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,160
beginning and we have been of course I

314
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,200
will say responsibly disclosed since the

315
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,100
2006 we created Partnerships uh and

316
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,620
virtual patch using our IPS engine

317
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,260
and we protect system both before they

318
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,899
have been even Patches from the vendors

319
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,000
and we started of course partnership

320
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,279
with those vendor Microsoft is the one

321
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,260
which of course has been highly targeted

322
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,420
since the beginning and now we have

323
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,079
about 80 Partners where we focus and

324
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,420
deliver in fact those information and

325
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,459
and video Amity visibility in terms of

326
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:37,920
zero day attacks and now we focus also

327
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,500
on the operational technology Fortinet

328
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
has been since now five years really

329
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,980
looking about this area which was

330
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,680
converging to the I.T and we have been

331
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,480
together partnership with companies like

332
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,480
cmns and and Schneider Electric or ABB

333
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,760
and G in the US and we already found

334
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,720
almost 45 zero diving ability in this OT

335
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,120
environment which of course help to

336
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,620
prevent problems here

337
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
the other aspect is about how we

338
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
definitely leverage in fact within the

339
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,459
40 watt labs this uh machine learning

340
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,740
and AI technology so we have been

341
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,480
pianoing since almost like 12 years

342
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
losing this technology and that's uh

343
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,220
it's used in fact internally of course

344
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,440
on the foreign labs and as I highlighted

345
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,959
in fact it's uh creates a lot of value

346
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,700
for the technology that our customer is

347
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,540
using

348
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,980
we we evaluate that the virtual analyst

349
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,660
let's call it uh using the machine

350
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,180
learning we estimate that alleviate

351
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,160
about 10 head counts

352
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,860
um from the the stock so typically using

353
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,660
more machine learning in fact you are

354
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,880
able to of course avoid having too much

355
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,160
people that are difficult to find

356
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,000
and effective machine learning required

357
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,699
data they require power and the required

358
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:54,480
times

359
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,839
time is the most critical element and

360
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,459
something that we realized a long time

361
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,959
ago and when you apply this Ai and

362
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,360
machine learning to the complete

363
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,639
end-to-end from the endpoint solution

364
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
from the sandbox from the EDR xdr the

365
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,620
platform and the cloud you have a very

366
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,959
effective in fact time to response and

367
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,760
the challenge is really to make sure

368
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,940
that we are able to prevent on time as

369
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,339
those attacks are becoming massive and

370
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,440
agree creating in fact description

371
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,019
and that's a very effective approach

372
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:30,839
against ransomware but as well as wiper

373
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,720
as the new risk is higher and the

374
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,839
prevention is very critical here

375
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,079
the team is also on the daily basis uh

376
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,600
looking about what's going on on the

377
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,820
dark web and the coverage and especially

378
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,420
on the Cyber criminal aspect so there's

379
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,820
a crime as a Services which is

380
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,399
flourishing right now by selling the use

381
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:56,339
of the infrastructure the tools and the

382
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,459
resource on the dark web

383
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,959
this is a portfolio that that's continue

384
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,240
to expand and there has been for over a

385
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,000
decade some examples are details as a

386
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,360
Services uh phishing Services stolen

387
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,540
credential for sales and ransomware as a

388
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,600
services and those kits are available to

389
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,880
Affiliates young people they can use

390
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,459
without too much technical expertise and

391
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,380
be able to control throughout expanding

392
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,480
the attack surface

393
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,579
we had the we have a threat hunting

394
00:16:26,579 --> 00:16:29,100
practice every days where we monitor the

395
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,860
dark web and the chatter we are looking

396
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,260
for new kits that been sold and other

397
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,839
indicators that can we can use for to

398
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,120
alert potential victims

399
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,880
this is uh accessible in fact through an

400
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:45,000
on-demand portal called 40 Recon we

401
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,040
monitor alert and we of course provide

402
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,980
some inquiry capability around those

403
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,860
elements on the dark web

404
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:55,620
now let's talk about uh a bit more what

405
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,779
we do see uh from the Switzerland

406
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:01,560
perspective and of course uh we have on

407
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,480
the website that we share in fact data a

408
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,760
bit more globally but uh Switzerland is

409
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,439
of course Very uh sensitive as well so

410
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,959
what we have observed in fact is that

411
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,980
back in 2022 Switzerland has been the

412
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,859
number four country in terms of over

413
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,720
attacks uh in the emea region so it's

414
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,160
roughly about nine percent of the

415
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,799
worldwide attacks so it's uh a very

416
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,380
targeted country uh mostly because there

417
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,740
is a lot of a strong organization a big

418
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,799
headquarter and and of course uh those

419
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:40,140
are been widely attacked we're talking

420
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,200
about 45 billions of total threats

421
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,020
against the

422
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,419
520 billions worldwide that we have seen

423
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,520
what we have also seen is that there was

424
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:54,780
a big wave in q1 2022 which was related

425
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,660
to the log log 4G which is still

426
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,900
remained a big threats today

427
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:03,360
in Q4 the attack that wave that we have

428
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,280
seen in Switzerland was more related to

429
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,380
iot and OT and specifically mirai.net

430
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,360
and the number one attacking segment

431
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,940
from Mirai was the manufacturing so

432
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,280
definitely as you can see a lot of

433
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,860
activity and that has been of course

434
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,720
evolving depending on the on the the

435
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,480
situation

436
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,780
on somewhere still of course uh a very

437
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,820
important aspect all the attack we do

438
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,640
see especially also in Switzerland and

439
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,760
and and more due to the ransomware as a

440
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,860
Services model that employ business

441
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,280
affiliate Partners to distribute the

442
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,980
attack campaign we and they get

443
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,539
commission so they get paid by

444
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,740
Commission

445
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,260
uh what is interesting here is that uh

446
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,080
previously this model had about 1 000

447
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,500
Partners they try to reduce uh right now

448
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,380
and be more selective and not focusing a

449
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,320
bit more on the vle uh segments or the

450
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,419
very large Enterprise segment and as

451
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:05,039
well as the OT and Manufacturing

452
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,700
segments so and inside this OT managing

453
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,919
is number one targeted segment

454
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:13,679
recently uh the trend in term of the

455
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,419
Cyber criminal are becoming more

456
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,000
selective so they they move from let's

457
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,919
say 100 kind of affiliate partner to

458
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,200
about uh so one thousand to about 100

459
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,140
right now and and the Hans firmware

460
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,360
attack has been also much more targeted

461
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,559
than before

462
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,460
so that as a consequence we do see that

463
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:36,000
the ransomware demand is moving from a

464
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,059
seven digit uh Ransom to eight digits or

465
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,160
a very big amount that had been asked to

466
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,460
be paid by the attacker

467
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,340
what we have seen is that overall the

468
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,260
ransomware attack that photograph lab

469
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,760
has seen is that in 2022 74 percent of

470
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,700
those ransomware was uh Financial crime

471
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,600
rated

472
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,380
and the rest was uh more accounting for

473
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,820
Espionage description cyber Farwell and

474
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,140
activism

475
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,480
but 82 percent of all the financial

476
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,820
crime are still answer merited so

477
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,580
whatever the the volumes are slightly

478
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,799
decreasing as you can see it's only 16

479
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,580
percent uh or say yeah yeah grow the uh

480
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,140
from a money perspective is still in

481
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,700
fact the massive in fact that amount

482
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,179
that that are leveraged by the attackers

483
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,160
um so we we still see an average about

484
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,980
400 million uh monthly Run summer attack

485
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,860
uh in the second half of uh 2022 still

486
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,879
very very positive

487
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,500
so talking about some of the 41 lab

488
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,500
prediction uh back in in as what we have

489
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,299
seen in fact in the last few quarters

490
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:48,900
and we do see an evolution in 2023

491
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,080
uh there's a massive grow of what they

492
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,880
call the wiper malware

493
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,600
so from Q4 2022 one of our prediction

494
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,460
was to continue to grow in the wiper

495
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,980
malware and we have seen a lot of strong

496
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,980
activity in fact currently wiper malware

497
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,320
is destructive in that theorem compared

498
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,940
to the ransomware where they encrypt

499
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,160
wiper will distract so there's no way

500
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,440
you can in fact recover from the data so

501
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,960
by naturally or much more threatful for

502
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,000
the attacker and for the people that

503
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
have been targeted

504
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,620
wipe disk it wiped system instead of

505
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:25,500
using description and wiper malware is

506
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,480
starting to be utilized by cyber

507
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,380
Criminal

508
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,900
so the volumes and the target are

509
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,659
increasing it's a new component of the

510
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,400
paybook for cyber criminals since they

511
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,860
can use as a threat strategy when

512
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,140
forcing organization to pay runs from

513
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,539
demand

514
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,080
as you can see there is overall about 16

515
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,140
new wiper malware weapon that has been

516
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,799
developed in 2022 this is unprecedented

517
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,020
the previous year we had only one per

518
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,740
year so definitely a big I will say

519
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,520
Activity in the first half of 2022 all

520
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,260
the wiper threads was related to one

521
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,240
Target in Ukraine

522
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
but however the code has been now

523
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,919
obtained and used in other attacks that

524
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,320
we have observed and in the second half

525
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,159
of 2022 cyber criminals are starting to

526
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,980
use in fact wiper threats some are even

527
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,140
now open source and available for

528
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,320
download

529
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,000
the result of this wiper being

530
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,400
accessible in fact that copy and

531
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Community ties we have seen a Tremors in

532
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,820
fact volumes and Target now

533
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,260
not just is related to Target the

534
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,840
Ukraine but on average we see about 13

535
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,120
000 wiper attacks on the monthly basis

536
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,340
especially what we have seen in Q4 so

537
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,760
it's a almost a 53 percent quarter to

538
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,700
quarter increase so definitely on top of

539
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,799
this ransomware with this this uh

540
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,679
migrants becoming in fact a big tools

541
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,780
for them

542
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,299
wiper using in fact of course they are

543
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:01,559
targeting for the windows but not only

544
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:04,500
Windows they are built for Linux Unix

545
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,799
Solaris so they are very effective in

546
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,299
critical infrastructure and OT

547
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:10,860
environment

548
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,080
so that's why we therefore predict a bit

549
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,299
more activity especially on these

550
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:18,720
operation technology and that the Cyber

551
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,980
control will Leverage

552
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,720
another I would say a prediction is

553
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,780
about the what we call uh the crime as a

554
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,320
Services as uh handsome as a service

555
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,240
model has been prolific especially over

556
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,919
the last five years

557
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,559
we expect cyber community to expand

558
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:40,020
their portfolio no offering weaponized

559
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,280
use of machine learning using AI

560
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,559
as an example the recognition of other

561
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,559
services are deep fake as a services

562
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,220
and they typically use tools that such

563
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:57,720
as chat GPT or chat gp4 to leverage in

564
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,020
fact and build in fact more this uh long

565
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,620
term as a services

566
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,120
the other element that we do see is this

567
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,500
converging in terms of this race

568
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,720
landscape typically there was two

569
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,900
category in terms of threat actors one

570
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,940
was the advanced persistent threat

571
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,900
groups

572
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,900
they are funded run by nation state and

573
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,820
I list of indicated

574
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,460
targeted they can take almost a year to

575
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,799
develop in fact the attacks they

576
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,419
traditionally focus on critical

577
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,559
infrastructure

578
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,360
on the other side you have these cyber

579
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,880
crime groups they have been privately

580
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
held from that sorry but not quite

581
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,580
wealthy due to the the the the profit of

582
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,220
this Transformer attacked and organize

583
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,320
criminal Enterprise after a year of this

584
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,080
profiting they are now focusing on

585
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,179
ransomware laundering Farm crime as a

586
00:24:48,179 --> 00:24:50,700
services and of course targeting

587
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,679
traditional I.T environment

588
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,080
what we are observing is that there is a

589
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:58,320
convergence of the two groups

590
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,419
and they are now working together to

591
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,539
share infrastructure share targets and

592
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:06,120
sponsorship attacks this convergence

593
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,880
phenomena we are calling Advanced

594
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,159
persistence cybercromb

595
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,200
so this means that now cyber criminal

596
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,159
also now switching Focus targeted more

597
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:19,919
sophisticated attack using wiper and

598
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,200
they can also now easily targeting

599
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,600
critical infrastructure it is a very

600
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,340
large shift that we do see in the Cyber

601
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,980
criminal aspect that's come almost for

602
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:31,260
75 percent of the overall attack we do

603
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,240
see

604
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,520
and this is really this kind of

605
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,860
evolution and conversion that uh from

606
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,260
these two kind of threat actors that we

607
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,879
are forcing behind the scene

608
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:47,580
so overall very challenging what we are

609
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,559
we have to face against they're also

610
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,779
having a lot of money very very

611
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:53,279
efficient time of using the latest

612
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,900
technology like we do to protect

613
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,659
ourselves so we're expecting a much more

614
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:00,539
complex future to deal in terms of the

615
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:01,559
attacks

616
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,260
now talking about how we can continue of

617
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,720
course to fight against these challenges

618
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,480
and it's about talking the collaboration

619
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,760
so we have a lot of initiative within

620
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,520
the private sector but unfortunate we do

621
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,440
see that it's critical that we are also

622
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,940
extending this collaboration and

623
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:20,220
partnership between the public and the

624
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,919
private the main reason is that we have

625
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:24,960
been building in fact Fortress we are

626
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,539
under attack but we are not able to go

627
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,220
against the Cyber criminal mostly

628
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,840
because they are operating in country

629
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,360
where law enforcement is not necessarily

630
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,559
the same as the targeted

631
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,720
company and the coordination worldwide

632
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,360
is not there so that's why we need to

633
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,460
create in fact this conversion moving

634
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,600
forward

635
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,480
so at fortunate we we have seen this as

636
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,059
a very critical piece which take time we

637
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,620
started collaboration with the world

638
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,940
econic from

639
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,179
uh which were we was a funding member of

640
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:00,000
the division called the c4c the center

641
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,240
for cyber security at the West

642
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,159
we have been starting a new project

643
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,799
which called The cybercrime Atlas

644
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,159
project and this was uh in fact funded

645
00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:13,799
inside the the c4c

646
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:17,700
we we pull about 20 analysts there that

647
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,620
I joined the project at about 1 000

648
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,440
hours of overall was set time to spend

649
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,320
and researching and of course operations

650
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,179
open source intelligence

651
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,760
the goal was to create a map of

652
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,400
cybercrime to be developed and to

653
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,100
identify on all angle and point of

654
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,960
description so we can form a kind of a

655
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,440
chain of description and ALT the Cyber

656
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,200
criminal in the chapter supply chain

657
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,580
so in q1 this year 2023 during the Davos

658
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,080
were they come from

659
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,600
Fortinet has announced becoming a

660
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,419
funding partner of this cyber crime

661
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,659
after initiative together with Microsoft

662
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:01,620
the Banco santanders Bank and PayPal and

663
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,740
the roadmap is to of course create this

664
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,919
governance staff resource funding so

665
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,440
this started in fact in q1

666
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,020
the mission of this address is to

667
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:14,700
mobilize a community of leading

668
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,600
organization and the network of cyber

669
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,640
initiative and subject matter expert

670
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,620
that can actively support and contribute

671
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,260
to description of cybercrime we want to

672
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,000
build an actionable intelligent about

673
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,279
cyber criminal landscape actors

674
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,039
ecosystem infrastructure

675
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:34,260
and also we want to identify and

676
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,080
communicate description opportunity

677
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,700
establishing in an action-oriented

678
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,299
Community a coordinate the ecosystem why

679
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,460
description effort with interdiction

680
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,100
technical Financial illegal action civil

681
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,799
action the Strategic inside and of

682
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,539
course creating in fact an overall

683
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:54,120
policy on combination so it's just the

684
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,100
beginning and we expect of course to

685
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,679
have more member joining to recreate in

686
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,260
fact this situation

687
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,299
I will say example about the

688
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:06,179
collaboration that is needed and more on

689
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,400
this private sector I was sharing about

690
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,559
the 40 watt labs and how we are

691
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,779
collecting and and generating a lot of

692
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:15,960
the data that we share we was 14 it was

693
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,000
the original co-founder of the Cyber

694
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,020
threat Alliance back in 2014 and today

695
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,419
there's about 35 members as you can see

696
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:26,940
a lot of members that are acting on the

697
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,460
Cyber safety space and most of this

698
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,140
member are competitor

699
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:34,260
so uh the the goal is that we can

700
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,000
develop and share this leading

701
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,640
intelligent platform and receive trusted

702
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,559
information pre-year the public

703
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,140
replication from event complete them and

704
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,820
we are of course able to collaborate and

705
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,039
share leveraging all of this uh

706
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,200
technology vendor in terms of uh

707
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,460
improving in fact the threat

708
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,799
intelligence and we want to remain very

709
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,659
competitive in terms of technology so we

710
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,820
make our threat intelligent actionable

711
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,440
and applied to the fabric that we are

712
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,940
selling

713
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,940
another example about this public and

714
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,460
and private collaboration is about the

715
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,760
uh myth so fortunate is a research

716
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,179
partner with the mid RND and we have two

717
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:13,500
already two previously threat

718
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
intelligent project with them and we

719
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,640
have more coming we are focusing on

720
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,159
advancing the set of the art and the set

721
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,539
of the practice in the threat

722
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,159
information difference

723
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:25,440
the systematic application of deep and

724
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,480
understanding and advocacy straight

725
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,200
craft anal technology protects against

726
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,539
the mitigate the cyber attacks so this

727
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:35,520
is really an important step that we have

728
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,960
been moving forward

729
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,559
and last it's about collaborating with

730
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,679
more let's say the Cyber police that we

731
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
do see that have been created in many

732
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,360
country so you need an organization that

733
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,179
of course we can we can leverage to go

734
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,220
against the attacker

735
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,799
14 that has been uh engaged with

736
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:58,260
Interpol since 2015.

737
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,480
14 had become what they call a member of

738
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,539
Interpol Gateway back to 2018

739
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:07,380
and we have been taken down a 16 million

740
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,380
business email compromise ring in

741
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:12,840
Nigeria which led to a successful arrest

742
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,880
and prosecution thanks to the

743
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,559
intelligence that we have shared with

744
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,260
our foreign labs and more recently we

745
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,880
have been working with them to take down

746
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,700
the prolific ransomware gangs the goal

747
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,659
here is that

748
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,539
we have information we can share and the

749
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,700
partners we have with Interpol and the

750
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,960
the partnership that they have with

751
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,520
local police and the Cyber defense they

752
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,980
are building in each country will allow

753
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,899
to potentially go against them and start

754
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,539
arresting so this is a very important

755
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,020
about semison and we have seen that in

756
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,539
this private sector a lot of investment

757
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:49,200
are now driving in fact more resource to

758
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,940
help in fact try to catch those people

759
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,559
so

760
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,620
um so those are overall I will say some

761
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,539
of the public and private partnership

762
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,960
example that we do see at Fortinet as a

763
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,299
a key element to fight against the Cyber

764
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:04,140
Criminal

765
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,039
so just to maybe summarize the forest is

766
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,140
yes we are of course a leading vendor in

767
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,059
this space but we need everyone we need

768
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,100
everyone in this room we need of course

769
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,740
the end user we need to create this uh

770
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,500
tight relationship so we can react on

771
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,779
time or even anticipate using some of

772
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,460
the technology we have been sharing

773
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,260
and we need of course the public sector

774
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,080
to of course becoming very proactive if

775
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,299
we want to fight again and not just be

776
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:33,059
passive but deeply becoming proactive

777
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,080
so that's the end of my presentation and

778
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:38,460
I think do we have if you have any

779
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,840
questions I think we'll be happy to

780
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,139
answer

781
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,220
there's one here yep

782
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,080
not too technical in case I'll ask one

783
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,639
of my the engineers to save it

784
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,059
yeah just make micro coming

785
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,159
thank you thank you for the presentation

786
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,799
this question is not a critical question

787
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:06,120
you say at the end you say we need all

788
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,760
of you but we never know in this kind of

789
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:11,340
events Who belongs to the crime

790
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,240
organizations so we don't know who in

791
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,500
this room

792
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,799
is in the dark side so it's always the

793
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,919
same I I always ask the same question

794
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:26,220
but nobody put any kind of control on

795
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,480
who is here

796
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:30,059
it's just a comment you know we thank

797
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,299
you it's a good good question of course

798
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:35,399
uh assuming that uh when search of

799
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:37,980
what's the event is organized it's of

800
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,640
course to uh partner and try to help on

801
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,799
this challenge you may have Insider

802
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,960
that's part of the life and uh it will

803
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,360
be very difficult to check uh who is The

804
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,419
Insider maybe Walking On the Dark Side

805
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:52,919
that's uh that's part of uh was a

806
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:54,659
natural so I don't think there is too

807
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,360
much a way to you know do this kind of

808
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,580
selection uh what we hope because we

809
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,860
have this positive hope is that there's

810
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,600
most of the people here are of course

811
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,820
try to help and fight

812
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,760
the challenge we have that's also a

813
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,139
consequent on the Evolution for the

814
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,359
let's say what we have to deal in from a

815
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:15,480
securing the the user and the data

816
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,280
there's in the past it was kind of a

817
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,379
trusted environment which was inside the

818
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,480
corporate or inside the public sector

819
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,300
corporate so you can't no longer in fact

820
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,480
you know build your Security based on

821
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,060
this statement so now the evolution is

822
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,739
to build what we call a zero trust

823
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,239
architecture

824
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,280
would mean zero trust means that no one

825
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,540
can be trusted

826
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,060
and you need to be able to identify the

827
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,580
user and you need to be able to look

828
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,739
about where the data is stored and the

829
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,719
behavior what is the behavior of the

830
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:47,280
user what's the kind of information they

831
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,739
are using whatever they will be working

832
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:52,379
from home working from inside so all

833
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:54,780
these uh element now leveraging

834
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,520
technology and the platform

835
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,460
allow it back to help on understanding

836
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,099
in fact the what's going on and that's

837
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,680
just a an evolution of course what need

838
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,720
to be built in the next three four years

839
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,079
but yes will be

840
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,540
attacker an Insider for sure but I'm

841
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,900
very confident and positive about the

842
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,700
mobilization that public sector

843
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,920
government are taking now and

844
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,260
understanding in fact the massive future

845
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,960
risk that we're all facing so I think it

846
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,280
should be a positive outcome in future

847
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,079
oh sorry

848
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,640
actually I got two two questions

849
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,280
question number one is quite simple

850
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,960
similar to the question before how can I

851
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,940
engage do you have a Mis instance where

852
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,440
I can subscribe to do you share your

853
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,079
intelligence how can I how can I

854
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,339
collaborate with you that's question

855
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,800
number one and the second question given

856
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,380
that this was supposed to be a

857
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,700
non-marketing but was a marketing talk

858
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,680
can you spend a little bit of more time

859
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,980
about uh the converging fret landscape

860
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:01,020
and say more about the flat actors which

861
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,540
you're observing whether they converge

862
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,220
wow

863
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,380
I I try to not to be uh you know imagine

864
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,140
my role at 48 of course I'm child of

865
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,940
developing the the company and the

866
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,820
business or and uh we was expecting also

867
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,260
to have it more kind of very technical

868
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,480
people that can answer on this threat

869
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,460
Evolution we have leading on the foreign

870
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,560
lab unfortunately

871
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,200
um we they couldn't make it so but there

872
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,300
will be potentially some uh some people

873
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,760
they can answer on this second question

874
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,520
on the first question is that we so you

875
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,520
can reach out to us on the 41 Labs uh

876
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,260
depending on how you want to collaborate

877
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,140
if you want to uh free thread until yeah

878
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:42,060
if you want to have access to the threat

879
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,040
Intel we have that's the follicle so

880
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,079
typically if you want to of course share

881
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,579
your threat Intel because the idea is

882
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:49,440
that we create community and that both

883
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,960
way do you that's typically uh reaching

884
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,599
out to us on the foreign Lobster

885
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:55,980

887
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,520
aspect uh now if you want to answer

888
