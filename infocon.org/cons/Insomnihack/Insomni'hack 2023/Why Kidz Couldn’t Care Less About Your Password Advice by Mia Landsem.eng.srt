1
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:06,540
uh so hello everyone my name is Mia

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,500
Lamson it was a great pronunciation

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,719
um and I work for orange cyber defense

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,839
and I'm really happy to be here and my

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,180
talk is called why kids couldn't care

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,660
less about your password advice

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,300
you can't be a speaker without talking

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,939
about yourself and I love talking about

9
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,679
myself and generally talk at all I'm a

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,960
pen tester ethical hacker at Orange

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,300
cyber defense in Norway we have an

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,000
office in Oslo

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,460
someone like to call me female hacker

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,360
and just to say that I'm female

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:47,640
but yeah I'm a pen tester but I usually

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,620
say ethical hacker because imagine being

17
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,020
the only girl on the team and people ask

18
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,460
what do you do for a living and I say

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,520
I'm a penetration tester

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,940
that sounds kind of bad

21
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:02,760
so isn't it strange for a pen tester to

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,739
come here and have maybe what we call

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,500
the least technical tall care but I

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,659
think this is quite technical

25
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:11,760
yeah and it's something that surrounds

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,979
us all the time it's about social media

27
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,320
and kids

28
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,000
and I guess maybe some of you have kids

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,100
you know kids you like kids you hate

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:21,119
kids

31
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,220
doesn't matter

32
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,020
I'm 25 but I often feel as I'm 80 and

33
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,259
I'm actually 26 in two weeks

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,479
but don't tell anyone because then it

35
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,560
means that I'm closer to 30 than 20.

36
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,420
so I'm 25.

37
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,060
I come from torontheim we're really

38
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,600
known for being big mouthed we talk a

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,780
lot we swear a lot so I'm very sorry if

40
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,939
I'm offending you

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:52,439
not

42
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,600
but I have lived in the capital for

43
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,720
almost 10 years now and I still have a

44
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,820
big mouth and I'm not gonna shut up

45
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,360
I am a former national team

46
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,759
member in Taekwondo double Nordic

47
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,000
Champion uh but then I hurt my knee you

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,700
know I got old I hurt my knee and then I

49
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,940
decided I'll be a lazy I.T professional

50
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,459
instead

51
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:20,160
um I'm also an author I actually wrote a

52
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,099
children's book a best-selling

53
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,020
um children's book called save online in

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Norway that came out in 2020. that was

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,720
pretty cool but I'm most known in Norway

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,420
for helping victims of image abuse

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,180
hacking and I work Against Child Abuse

58
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,040
so all the pedophile stuff I also do

59
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,700
identity theft causes fraud causes love

60
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,099
scam

61
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:49,500
and yeah I've had hundreds of talks I

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,540
started doing talks five years ago I

63
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,080
have done about 500 now

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,819
and I did that while being a student

65
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:58,800
full-time student I've been a pen tester

66
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,720
for two and a half year so the right

67
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
after my studies and I was like okay I

68
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,560
will do this this sounds cool

69
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,340
and now I do about 70 talks a year

70
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,560
next to my full-time job

71
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,000
imagine

72
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
but I also helped thousands of victims

73
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,519
so I am a pen tester at Orange cyber

74
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,200
defense but I do also have my own

75
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,959
company on the side where I help victims

76
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:23,459
for free

77
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,680
if it's hacking if it's just how do I

78
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,860
reset my password if it's identity theft

79
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,440
it's digital violence image abuse child

80
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,420
abuse I don't care I do it for free

81
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,300
because I I mean that it should be free

82
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,040
to get help

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,799
uh so I do that on this side and I and

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,340
uh of course I go and have my um talks

85
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,819
I also in pen testing I mostly do web

86
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:51,120
applications apis and social engineering

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,780
both physical and uh digitally

88
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,739
we're gonna talk about kids social media

89
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:02,299
authenticating

90
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,580
passwords how to teach children cyber

91
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,680
security sexual harassment and image

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,040
abuse this is a quite the mix of a lot

93
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
of the things that I do and we have

94
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,959
social media I guess you guys you have

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,959
social media so

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,019
um social media places where we can talk

97
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,020
together share like have our very own

98
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,660
profile like Facebook Snapchat Tick Tock

99
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,580
blah blah and 97 of children age 9 to 18

100
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,740
in Norway they actually have their own

101
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,000
phone

102
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,500
and it's mostly a smartphone

103
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,160
87 of those aged 9 and 10.

104
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,940
and 90 of children age 19 has a social

105
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,979
media profile 50 of the nine-year-olds

106
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,919
65 of the 10 year olds

107
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,220
and I think that's quite a lot a very

108
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,199
very young children

109
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,440
and this is numbers from Norway I guess

110
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,320
it's different for each country so if

111
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,639
you have numbers from your own country

112
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,820
I'm always open to read and see send

113
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,160
them to me if you want to

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,580
and the application they're using 80

115
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,000
your Snapchat Tick Tock was just 65 in

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,039
the 2020

117
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,160
um Facebook 51 and YouTube almost

118
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,080
everyone

119
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,960
but do they really use them all

120
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,919
um so I see that I have several channels

121
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,220
where victims can contact me and I see

122
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:40,259
that mostly children they are contacting

123
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:43,560
me on Instagram or or SnapChat open

124
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,539
SnapChat

125
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:47,400
uh but the older people they're

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,880
contacting me by email and Facebook

127
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,520
I have a home page where people can ask

128
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,800
for help I answer everyone absolute

129
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,660
everyone

130
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,100
and that that's the big difference you

131
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,020
know grown-ups they're using Facebook

132
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:03,960
like children are using tick tock

133
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,080
I don't see 10 11 12 year olds actually

134
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,360
use Facebook that much they don't really

135
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,639
have profile pictures they're not

136
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:13,979
writing anything but here comes the

137
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,300
dinosaurs

138
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,280
who wants to talk about what they had

139
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,659
for dinner every day

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,520
it's Diana Buck Boomer book

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,800
but we do have some bad sides social

142
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,259
media gaming everything is so cool you

143
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,120
guys know this you love this stuff it's

144
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,940
super cool uh but three out of four of

145
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,100
these uh children report that they have

146
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,280
blocked someone on social media 7 out of

147
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,259
10 reports that they have added a

148
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:45,960
stranger on social media and I can

149
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,580
imagine parents are telling their

150
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,039
children do not add strangers on social

151
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:51,720
media

152
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,620
seven out of 10 does

153
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,960
26 report that they have been bullied

154
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,280
online in 2020 and 15 reported that they

155
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,800
had received threats

156
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,720
I think these are

157
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,000
really high numbers

158
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,160
everyone knows a child and I think it's

159
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,979
horrible to know that so many of them

160
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,780
are reporting this

161
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,960
and there's a lot of bad sides and stuff

162
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,340
on the internet that parents and

163
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,500
grown-ups are afraid of when they're

164
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,680
considering children bullying dangerous

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,479
people who loves children like

166
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,979
pedophiles

167
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,139
and abuse

168
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,099
but when I talk to parents I do a lot of

169
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:36,960
talks for parents and workshops and

170
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,220
trainings

171
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,080
and I asked them what are they afraid of

172
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,319
but no one is really mentioning hackers

173
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:45,060
when I ask them what are you afraid of

174
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,979
if you think about your child's safety

175
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:49,380
online no one says hackers

176
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,599
or lots of passwords or personal

177
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,400
information

178
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,199
and I think that's where they only think

179
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,060
about like the pedophiles and they think

180
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,979
about all of this of course because it's

181
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,000
horrible

182
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,960
and how could we really protect them

183
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,500
even dinosaurs knows that children also

184
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,259
has to authenticate on social media or

185
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:12,419
gaming platforms

186
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,880
children too so everyone needs to

187
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,160
authenticate login you need an email a

188
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,160
username a password the children as well

189
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,879
but 24 says that they have shared their

190
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,000
password with someone and I think like

191
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,699
you you say to children like if it comes

192
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,179
to a man in this white van and says he

193
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,979
has kittens in the back

194
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,179
don't go in there we tell these stories

195
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,320
um

196
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,419
and we also tell children do not share

197
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,219
your password with anyone it's a big

198
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,260
secret but they do

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,440
and they do enter the van sometimes

200
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,019
we can't stop it fully

201
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:52,740
um

202
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,260
but also we do tell them don't don't

203
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,339
share your password but 29 of children

204
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:02,220
knows their parents password on app

205
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,620
store or Google Play

206
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,600
I remember not to share your password

207
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,339
with anyone

208
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,860
but they're doing the exact same thing

209
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,399
themselves

210
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,060
I think that's the way and I think a lot

211
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,760
of parents and we know this humans we

212
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,860
reuse passwords

213
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,899
I have parents contacting me because

214
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:27,180
their child has hacked them

215
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,240
hack their Facebook their Instagram

216
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,459
they're like ah I hate you I ran away

217
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,839
from home and just hack everything

218
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,580
because they knew their password on the

219
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,540
App Store

220
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,339
because they think it's easy

221
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:40,320
yeah so do not share your password with

222
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,720
anyone we do have parental controls

223
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,700
parents are like huh parent parental

224
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,860
controls some parents know about this

225
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,200
but most platforms does have parental

226
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,540
controls you don't even really need to

227
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,279
share your password

228
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,160
I also have parents fun story

229
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,680
that tell me uh my child knew my

230
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,019
password on the App Store

231
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:06,899
and use like 10 000 kroner Norwegian

232
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,720
kroner so let's say a thousand Euro

233
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,940
uh on my games

234
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,880
can you help me get the money back

235
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,180
imagine your child is spending money on

236
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,120
Roblox or Minecraft and you contact

237
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,100
customer support

238
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,320
yeah I give my password to my App Store

239
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,240
to my kid and I always bought a lot of

240
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,760
stuff can you give me my money back

241
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,459
ah good luck with that on the insurance

242
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,760
but why do they share passwords

243
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,640
and these are again Norwegian numbers

244
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,220
25 to get help with something 21 in case

245
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,940
they would forget seven percent to prove

246
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,019
that I am a good friend and 59 percent

247
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,480
shared it through hell out with Snapchat

248
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,660
streaks

249
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,820
so Snapchat streaks is the biggest

250
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,880
reason for children under 18 to give out

251
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,860
their password

252
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,079
and that sounds to you really stupid

253
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,519
doesn't it

254
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,380
who cares about Snapchat's trick

255
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,200
children does

256
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,839
Snapchat streak is a much bigger deal

257
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:20,279
than you might guess

258
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,380
how does it work

259
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,540
um after three days of snapping you get

260
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,579
this really cool Flame

261
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:28,980
and it will start to count the days that

262
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,079
you guys have been snapping each other

263
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,360
if you don't snap them for about 24

264
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,600
hours an hourglass will show up next to

265
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,060
the flame and you will lose your number

266
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,560
of streaks

267
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
and then you have to start all over and

268
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,100
imagine being of 300 400 600 days and

269
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,920
you lose the streak

270
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,320
I broke up with my boyfriend but we kept

271
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
a streak for a few more weeks

272
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,779
but once he broke the streak I knew it

273
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:00,120
was officially over

274
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,579
that day was so sad the street lasted

275
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:07,740
457 days it can really hurt when a

276
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,480
streak ends some of my friends get

277
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,820
offended if I break a streak and others

278
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,920
don't care as much it all depends on the

279
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,760
person

280
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,920
my parents took my phone away one time

281
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,779
and I gave my friend my login to my

282
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:21,120
Snapchat so she could keep up my streaks

283
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,459
I was panicked about losing them all

284
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,959
because I couldn't get to my phone for

285
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,279
two days while I was grounded

286
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,740
and you know even I I don't really give

287
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,560
a about streaks or social media but

288
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,899
me and my uh friend in another IT

289
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,660
company we started making this as a joke

290
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,540
and we never talked together we never

291
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,279
snap each other

292
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:47,639
but we have this one snap a day

293
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,380
streak

294
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,120
just to keep the street we're actually

295
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,500
almost on day 700 since this was made

296
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,360
and even I now feel

297
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,880
this was a joke and I don't really care

298
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,100
and I'm kinda grown up

299
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,660
kinda

300
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,740
but I still care I even called him once

301
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,920
Magnus we're losing a streak and he

302
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,380
sends me streak

303
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,560
I mean it's it's pretty funny

304
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,139
but what can we do about this stuff

305
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,500
of course be a good influence and role

306
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,060
model like dear dinosaurs make sure that

307
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,339
you know what the kids do but also

308
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,040
yourself don't do this don't do that but

309
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,360
I can

310
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,579
you're doing the same thing you're

311
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,680
telling them not to do

312
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,560
schools need to implement better first

313
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,139
passwords

314
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:45,180
so schools are mostly the first places

315
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,220
where children actually gets the first

316
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:50,160
passwords to the maybe the library at

317
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,980
school and for their school user maybe

318
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:56,880
for their iPads users that's the first

319
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,620
passwords

320
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,260
some schools they use the last names and

321
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,300
the year they're born I remember my

322
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,740
login my login password was learn me97

323
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,740
1997.

324
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
I hacked people

325
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,480
absolutely

326
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,700
can't charge me for that now but of

327
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,500
course we could just guess everyone's

328
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,920
password and this you you think this is

329
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,820
20 years ago no no this still happens

330
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,519
schools still do this

331
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,760
and it's easily gets passwords and I

332
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,980
think maybe we could start using some

333
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,899
sort of password managers who are

334
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,600
actually created for schools maybe the

335
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:45,600
IT people can have control of it and

336
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,120
teach them how to make good passwords

337
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,060
and two-step security

338
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,180
there's a million functions on one

339
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,180
password key pass LastPass

340
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,279
and you know a lot of you have password

341
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,660
managers do you use all the functions

342
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,079
no I don't I sure don't use all the

343
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,120
functions when you're a premium paying

344
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,079
accounts

345
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,980
why does it have to be so complicated

346
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,579
we need to make some easy ones as well

347
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,100
for old people

348
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
not the

349
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,240
technically old people here but all very

350
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,940
old people who are struggling with their

351
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,459
finances their social media profiles

352
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,040
they could have managers that maybe they

353
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,440
can also have help from their family

354
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,560
and also easy ones for kids why do we

355
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,779
first hear about password managers when

356
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:47,040
we're into itsec or we are like 24. I

357
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,079
think that's kind of weird

358
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,199
um and why do they share password with

359
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:54,779
someone to get help

360
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,699
I think it's because it's embarrassing

361
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,399
to help parents for help sometimes even

362
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:01,920
you you would imagine if you're a parent

363
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,320
and you're into I.T sec

364
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,600
wow you you have a really cool Dad or

365
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,060
Mom they know I.T you can just go to

366
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,740
them for questions

367
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,920
but they won't all the time I have a

368
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,199
friend and here is a sister

369
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,540
and his daughter refuses to get help

370
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,779
from him she said to him I like Mia

371
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,120
better than you and and I think you

372
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,860
should call her and ask she can tell me

373
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,339
what to do and that's really funny

374
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,060
um

375
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,000
and I think it's important that children

376
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,240
need other instances other people to ask

377
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,079
from help not just you as the parent

378
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,660
maybe you also learn teach them to use

379
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,820
TeamViewer

380
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,180
look around for other dinosaurs that can

381
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:50,519
help them maybe they have a cool teacher

382
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:52,680
maybe the I.T Personnel in their school

383
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,480
make sure they know they can get help

384
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,000
from everyone else don't let them get

385
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,519
help from the scammer on the RuneScape

386
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,860
and all of that I remember I lost my

387
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:04,439
RuneScape Easter because these guys said

388
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,260
he would help me create a fire to make

389
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,459
food

390
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,679
and he said he needed my password so he

391
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,380
can log in so I was hacked

392
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,780
yeah that's the one time I think and

393
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,359
hope I've been hacked

394
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,240
why couldn't I just ask someone

395
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,099
I didn't think of that

396
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:25,439
although I think kids they're getting

397
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,799
lazy kids they're they have iPads when

398
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,640
they're like born they come after their

399
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,360
mom and they have an iPad in their hands

400
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,400
they say that Norwegians were born with

401
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,799
skis on our feet now we're born with an

402
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,600
iPhone in our hands

403
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,360
and you should then think that they are

404
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,120
technically smart but actually they're

405
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,419
getting really lazy they asked me for

406
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,539
the simple stuff they can Google it like

407
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:58,020
hi Mia how do I reset my password I have

408
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:00,240
14 year olds that asked me this question

409
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,720
and I think that's a very easy thing so

410
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,000
they usually ask so don't just give them

411
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
the answer

412
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,480
but give them a way to figure it out

413
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,900
themselves that's how you learn

414
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,020
and why do they not know about two-step

415
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,120
authentication

416
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,780
they are so smart

417
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,299
and they have don't have this

418
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:26,820
very few of them are not enabling

419
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,799
two-factor Authentication

420
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,200
and I think we need to understand what

421
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
is important to them and why

422
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
and also did you see in my presentation

423
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,600
two-step security

424
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,960
two-step authentication

425
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,780
hmm

426
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,760
authorizing do you think children or

427
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,100
normal people use the word authorize

428
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,260
when they log in

429
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,360
if I go into my computer I say I'm just

430
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,340
going to log in I'm just gonna

431
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,220
authenticate on this web application

432
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:01,980
no one talks like that

433
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,500
no one I don't understand like my I.T

434
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,960
security books at it school I didn't get

435
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,179
what are they saying I had to Google

436
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,059
everything like uh I felt so dumb

437
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:15,059
and we should make things more dumb why

438
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,720
are we not standardizing

439
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,919
important

440
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,580
why authorize say login

441
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,039
or whatever why two step something

442
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,400
something something

443
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,780
standardize it on behalf of everyone

444
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,299
just standardize it we do have standards

445
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,400
we do have words everyone knows what the

446
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,780
hacking is

447
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,780
you know why why like if you go to

448
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,260
Instagram Facebook if like Meta Even use

449
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,640
different words

450
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
for this and how like we technical

451
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,380
people we understand this I.T people

452
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,059
understand this is okay two-step

453
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:53,640
security which is simple

454
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,320
easy words

455
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,960
but imagine 10 year olds oh yeah they

456
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,460
need to enable two-factor or something

457
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,020
something

458
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,840
it's just stupid

459
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,740
losing a Snapchat streak may cause drama

460
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,980
and fights and it's a way to prove who

461
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,100
is the best of friends

462
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,140
and people laugh when I talk about this

463
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,480
you know they think it's silly I thought

464
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,240
it was silly until I was there myself

465
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,039
and I called Magnus you know I'm like

466
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,660
yeah we're losing a streak you need to

467
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,400
save it

468
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,100
it's more important to kids to have a

469
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,280
Snapchat streak than security

470
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,220
Street gives some friends and status and

471
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,440
I think Snapchats to make two-step

472
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,679
security a must to have the honor of

473
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,120
having strict

474
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,520
to get strict you need to enable this

475
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,360
like you're giving them a carrot a cake

476
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,720
and if that can make them think one more

477
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,940
time before giving out their password to

478
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,860
someone I think it's gonna help

479
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:58,919
I don't I also don't like the thought

480
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,280
that children should pay for stuff but

481
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,600
you know they spend all their money on

482
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,179
Minecraft and Roblox anyway so maybe

483
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,340
Snapchat could Implement

484
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,200
um something that costs a small amount

485
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,260
of money like one week without losing

486
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,600
your streak if you go on holiday you

487
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,059
lose your phone whatever okay then let

488
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,799
people pay

489
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,059
to not lose the streak

490
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,960
um and I think

491
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,400
parents

492
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,460
they take away their children's phones

493
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,440
if they did something bad yeah you're

494
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,179
not getting this computer for a few days

495
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,460
yeah I'm taking your phone away for four

496
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,700
days

497
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,780
they're gonna lose the streaks

498
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:43,460
so let the kids log into their phone

499
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:47,640
just once a day to keep the streak take

500
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,100
the phone away but just let them keep

501
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,840
the streak

502
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,539
is it more important to you this uh

503
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,919
punishment

504
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,440
and losing the streak which may cause

505
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:01,440
drama and fights with the friends do you

506
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,360
need that to prove your point

507
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,460
or can you just let them do that even

508
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:07,140
though you think it's silly it's really

509
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,480
important to them and if that may stop

510
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,940
them from sharing their password with a

511
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,240
stranger a pedophile a hacker I think

512
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,559
it's worth it

513
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,659
I really do

514
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,700
and when it comes to gaming because I

515
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:24,240
think gaming is a nice place for kids to

516
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,580
be of course and grown-ups I love gaming

517
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,539
and 86 of these young people they play

518
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,299
games online they have good reaction

519
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:35,280
skills and they can use it in other

520
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,659
activities

521
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:39,179
and 70 feel that they are learning

522
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:40,919
English better

523
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:43,440
many kids get bullied to games and also

524
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,260
we have the the pedophiles they are on

525
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,320
all platforms where children are and the

526
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,720
games also need the password I have

527
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,080
parents messaging me hi my son just got

528
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,720
hacked on Minecraft and he has spent a

529
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,659
lot of money on this can you help us get

530
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:03,440
his account back

531
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:06,240
if it was a good password and people are

532
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,280
talking to their kids in a better way I

533
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,620
think they wouldn't lose their user

534
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,600
imagine they have been working on this

535
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,840
user for a year spend all the money they

536
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,320
earned on tidying their bed and washing

537
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,900
doing the dishes for you because they

538
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,299
wanted to do this stuff in the games

539
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:27,740
and now they lost it

540
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,960
and where did I learn about security I

541
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,880
learned about security from gaming

542
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,120
so kids and you we have multiple

543
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,460
passwords and you should have multiple

544
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,500
passwords they say because if you get

545
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,360
hacked on one side then you won't get

546
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,000
hacked on the other one then blah blah

547
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,460
so we need to have multiple passwords

548
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,240
and we also need to safely keep track of

549
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,299
passwords and they need to be strong and

550
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,159
long

551
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:01,860
sounds easy but it's not really easy if

552
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,919
you have like 30 social media profiles

553
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,960
and the first password as mentioned

554
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,059
before are received by parents or at

555
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,179
school and the passwords they creating

556
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,400
themselves are related to their lives

557
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,360
Sports gaming animals names numbers or

558
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,500
colors

559
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,900
I remember mine pretty well it was

560
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,140
football 1997.

561
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,080
you can find them on the leaked lists

562
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,900
on pound don't have the same passwords

563
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,320
anymore but you can try

564
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,539
also when I had to change my password I

565
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:39,980
was a bit older I changed it to

566
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,780
mia0904 because I'm born the 9th of

567
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:43,980
April

568
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,260
but then they started saying yeah you

569
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:50,640
need a longer passport okay mia09040904

570
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,140
and if you need a special uh character

571
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,760
you know

572
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,120
you know what my password was then

573
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,080
this works I use them until I was 16

574
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,780
around 16.

575
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,240
that's almost 10 years ago

576
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,140
it's not that long ago is it I was 16. I

577
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,380
had those really bad passwords and the

578
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,539
younger kids they rely on family support

579
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,080
for password maintenance

580
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,140
they are learning best practices I knew

581
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,360
I need a long password and blah blah

582
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,940
blah but we have really bad password

583
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,740
habits

584
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,740
I think a lot of people have they reuse

585
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,880
the passwords and sharing password with

586
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,700
uh with your wife with your husband with

587
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,440
your friends or strangers

588
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,919
some people into gaming know this game

589
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,960
what rewards do I get for enabling

590
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,020
two-factor authentication again

591
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:59,159
this is a mostly a kids game

592
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:03,240
why this works I don't know 2fa on my

593
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,000
epic games account as a reward for

594
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,220
securing your account with two photo and

595
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,279
dedication you'll unlock the boogie down

596
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,419
remote in fortnite

597
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,960
even games and gaming companies are

598
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,299
better at educating children about

599
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:24,600
passwords and security

600
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,200
done Facebook Instagram and all of these

601
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,760
people creating all these gaming

602
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,080
applications

603
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,000
you know if you hacked on Instagram and

604
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,460
you you try the help support page you

605
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,799
won't understand it won't do

606
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,380
and if you contact them you will get a

607
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,299
reply from a robot

608
00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,240
doesn't do anything they don't care

609
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,419
they offer them something here a reward

610
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,340
something they really like something

611
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,980
that might give them status

612
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,559
Snapchat and other platform where

613
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:58,080
children usually are should also offer

614
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,620
them something I don't know what but we

615
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,659
need to realize that children are here

616
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,820
to stay

617
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,700
and the bad habits and the things they

618
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,400
learn as an old a young age will follow

619
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,279
them for the rest of their lives and you

620
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:17,760
know bad habits are hard to break

621
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,279
so if you really care about this imagine

622
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:22,919
maybe you don't have children maybe you

623
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:25,080
hate children maybe you're thinking and

624
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
having children or you just generally

625
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,100
care maybe you're an aunt you're an

626
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,620
uncle you have children around you that

627
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,720
you want to protect

628
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,480
remember you are here stuck people I

629
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,580
don't know if there's any bosses here or

630
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,320
people that hire people

631
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,500
with these kids with the bad habits

632
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:47,760
you're gonna hire them in 10 to 15 years

633
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,260
you are

634
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:52,200
I was 16 10 years after I'm here as a

635
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,179
hacker in Orange cyber defense

636
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:58,320
I still reuse my password everyone does

637
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,860
I still have the bad habits

638
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,100
I wish someone told me earlier that I

639
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,539
should make those habits I didn't have

640
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:09,720
anyone to teach me this at all

641
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
so remember that if you don't care about

642
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,100
this or blah blah blah you work for a

643
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,600
big tech company now we don't want to

644
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,279
spend money on the standardizing this

645
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,080
and that so these are your colleagues

646
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,960
this might be the person clicking on the

647
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,919
fishing

648
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,779
email

649
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:27,840
losing their password being blackmailed

650
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,320
and so on

651
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,880
when it comes to sexual harassment and

652
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,980
image views which is a kind of what I'm

653
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,440
famous for sounds like I'm a real

654
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,080
criminal or a real creep they called me

655
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,620
the naked data detective in Norway

656
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,140
sounds really weird

657
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:46,860
um

658
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,980
but three out of 10 of those between 13

659
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,020
and 18 report that they have received

660
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,340
sexual comments in one year 2020. 19 of

661
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:59,880
those between 13 and 14 and then the

662
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,419
statistics are arising with their age

663
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:04,260
um

664
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:07,559
26 reports they have been bullied and

665
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,520
again 15 they receive threats 12 of

666
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,340
those age 13 to 18 had sent a nude photo

667
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:18,480
of themselves just in 2020 in Norway and

668
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,220
13 of them got paid for doing it

669
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,140
you know it is a lot of children in this

670
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,720
world and that's a lot of children

671
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:30,120
some ask themselves why send their same

672
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,760
nudes well it's not your business not

673
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,179
your problem my body my choice Latin

674
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:37,559
America I guess

675
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,799
love it could be for Love Money status

676
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,700
it could be exciting our whole lives

677
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
moved from the physical world to the

678
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,820
digital one so of course the sexual life

679
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,899
moved there as well

680
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,000
the thing is

681
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,120
what happened when children and people

682
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,240
lose control of their passwords or trust

683
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,279
the wrong person

684
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,020
Snapchat memory

685
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,240
okay backed up in a cloud

686
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,940
it will save all the pictures

687
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,380
automatically actually when you when you

688
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,120
actually register it will automatically

689
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,600
save everything you have to turn it off

690
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,360
so if they take a nude photo maybe with

691
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,820
the with someone they love or themselves

692
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,860
and they save it it's gonna be in the

693
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,559
Snapchat memory

694
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,960
and then oh

695
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,380
I'm grounded by my mom

696
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,360
um could you please keep my streaks here

697
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,159

698
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,399
Snapchat user and keep my streaks up

699
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,679
and maybe this person is a bit curious

700
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,520
what do you have in your Snapchat memory

701
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,399
to look in the photos oh they see a nude

702
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,380
photo oh that's exciting this the

703
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,000
children you know they think this is

704
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,059
really exciting even grown-ups

705
00:30:57,059 --> 00:30:59,159
and what do they do what might they do

706
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,679
they might save that picture on their

707
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,779
own device

708
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,440
they might be a not your friend it could

709
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,360
be a stranger you met online maybe

710
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,340
flirting with

711
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:14,100
give them the password they log in

712
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,620
and now you lose control

713
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,080
it's their life and it's their Digital

714
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,279
Life

715
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:22,200
and in what I do

716
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,620
I see a lot of it makes me sick it

717
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,779
makes me throw up it makes me cry at

718
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,640
night it makes me anxious

719
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:35,159
I talk to children at the age of 16 who

720
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,380
are forced to have sex with their abuser

721
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,380
to not get their pictures leaked I talk

722
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,500
to children at the age of 17 that had a

723
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,539
sex video saved somewhere in the cloud

724
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:48,659
in Snapchat whatever and now someone

725
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,000
hacked their account or got access to it

726
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,340
and they're saying give me a thousand

727
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,480

730
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,500
who was just 15 who is no longer alive

731
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,320
because someone decided to Blackmail

732
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,659
them and post their sex video on their

733
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,080
stories

734
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,940
these forums you're seeing in this

735
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,039

737
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,760
WhatsApp

738
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,059
all of these pages are created just to

739
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,960
harass victims of image abuse

740
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,919
the groups made all over the world with

741
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,320
thousands of people joining them

742
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,419
to see photos that they should not see

743
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,720
or have access to there are hackers

744
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,460
online they don't care about your

745
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,320
passwords they're not here to scam you

746
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,779
for your money with some love scam

747
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:51,419
they hack victims

748
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:53,640
they hack their Snapchat they hack their

749
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,299
iCloud to Blackmail them

750
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:59,640
and it doesn't always end well and I

751
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,640
speak to victims who stop replying and

752
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,679
then their parents find their computer

753
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,080
see they have talked to me and say thank

754
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,360
you for trying to help her daughter I'm

755
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,399
sorry to say C is dead and we would love

756
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,120
to talk to you

757
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,899
I shouldn't be the one visiting the

758
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,840
graves as the first time I met them I

759
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,460
should be talking to them shaking their

760
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,980
hands giving them a hug

761
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,799
but I meet them at the graves gravestone

762
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,659
and I think that's horrible

763
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:33,000
and these platforms you might see

764
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,380
Discord

765
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,380
they don't do enough to stop this

766
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:40,380
for uh for John Reddit

767
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,380
we have big threads forums full with

768
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:45,960
image abuse children

769
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,940
children killing themselves because

770
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,460
they're posted there and what do they do

771
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,640
when I report it absolutely nothing

772
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,880
Discord and all of these platforms

773
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:00,059
they're rich the creators they're rich

774
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:02,100
why is it someone answering on Instagram

775
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,720
who is the robot

776
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,059
we keep creating all of these

777
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,339
opportunities and software Technologies

778
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,899
and functions

779
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:12,119
but we are forgetting the people who are

780
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,679
going to use it

781
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,020
we give people this opportunity this is

782
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,899
great but be a bit careful and when and

783
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:20,940
when when they up no one's there to

784
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,440
help them

785
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,060
robots

786
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,440
I think it's really sad

787
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,780
the children they are on social media

788
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,960
and they face the same cyber threats as

789
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:41,399
we do as grown-ups as dinosaurs as cyber

790
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,918
companies the same threats

791
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,379
we need to understand and we need to

792
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,899
talk to them about what is important to

793
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:50,520
them even though you think Snapchat

794
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,760
streak is ridiculous I don't care they

795
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,879
care and then you should care

796
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,400
companies who are supposed to keep us

797
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,540
all safe

798
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,160
they need to create more Simple

799
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,800
Solutions for the young ones and of

800
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,900
course the old ones

801
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,960
they get love scam all the time they're

802
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,300
80 they're 90 and even younger they get

803
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,920
scammed all the time what does the banks

804
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,720
do absolutely nothing

805
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,000
they even see oh they're transferring

806
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,820
their whole payments

807
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,280
to someone in The Gambia

808
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,780
oh but we can't do anything

809
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,180
we need to standardize and simplify

810
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,240
password managers password and security

811
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:36,180
related words and informations like

812
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,160
two-step Factor something something

813
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,380
we need to standardize it all and we

814
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,780
have to to re like when I make a

815
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,880
penthouse report I have this really

816
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,380
technical parts

817
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,380
but in the summary I'm told you need to

818
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,599
write it so that the biggest idiot on

819
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,579
Earth will understand what you found in

820
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:55,079
this report

821
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:58,079
to the non-technical boss because they

822
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,060
won't understand the scripts and the

823
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,940
codes but they need this summary that

824
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:05,339
everyone should understand

825
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:07,560
but if you read on Instagram and and

826
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,240
whatever platforms you're not gonna

827
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,140
understand

828
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,140
Snapchat and other companies need to

829
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,240
look at the biggest factors of children

830
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,640
and of course everyone else giving away

831
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,140
passwords

832
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,800
is that stupid streak to make people use

833
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,859
your application and click on ads more

834
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,079
important than children safety health

835
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,300
and their life

836
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,640
then I want Snapchat to start answering

837
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,520
my emails and my me trying to reach them

838
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,619
on the social media and they can join me

839
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,900
on the kids graves and tell me that

840
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,599
Snapchat streak has a good function what

841
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,060
good does Snapchat streak do people

842
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,980
absolutely nothing

843
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,859
and 59 of children gives away the

844
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:54,839
password so it's a high risk high

845
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,119
security risk so why don't they remove

846
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,460
it money money money money

847
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,720
the internet is as big as space or the

848
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,240
universe really and that means we do not

849
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,180
quite know how big it is

850
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,000
and while I'm here on this Earth I want

851
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,640
to make a difference

852
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,619
not everyone has to be me a lot of

853
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,839
people say Mia we should have more

854
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,119
people like you and it's a compliment

855
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,339
it's nice to say that and maybe it would

856
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:30,000
be cool so I don't have to work work all

857
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,740
day all night

858
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,500
that we shouldn't have someone like me

859
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,640
at all someone in the middle of the 20s

860
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,920
using the half of the twenties fighting

861
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,400
for something that is not even her job

862
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,040
something is failing and I'm not saying

863
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,420
we need more people like me I'm not

864
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,040
saying you need to do the same that

865
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,180
I do

866
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:54,240
but if everyone can do just one thing

867
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,700
don't blame victims

868
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,859
be nice be kind

869
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,900
care about people

870
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:03,420
make sure that you are a safe person

871
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,400
that they can come to

872
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,400
a lot of parents for example would say

873
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,140
no never post a nude photo of yourself

874
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,020
you're shutting the door locking it

875
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,540
you're making sure that this kid will

876
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,460
never come to you for help and what are

877
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:23,280
we here for we are here to help

878
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,339
we need to show them the consequences of

879
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,780
what can happen and then they can think

880
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,640
for themselves

881
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,320
we make we need to make sure that

882
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,460
they're coming when something is

883
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,980
happening instead of going out

884
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:37,020
walking their dog at night and not

885
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,060
coming back home and they're found in

886
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,859
the forest the day after

887
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,660
after everyone's been looking for them

888
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,480
because they didn't know where to go

889
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,000
and I think it's really sad

890
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,180
so to answer

891
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,940
my question my whole presentation why

892
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,859
kids couldn't care less about your

893
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,420
password advice

894
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,680
they don't speak dinosaur

895
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,780
and that's why I think this is very

896
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,060
important and I hope that everyone here

897
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,820
can take out something good of what I

898
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,040
said maybe you didn't learn anything new

899
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,460
maybe you have a new view on stuff like

900
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,839
this

901
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:16,500
um

902
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,020
I'm on LinkedIn you can connect with me

903
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,060
if you have something you want to tell

904
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:23,099
me even if it's a story even if you

905
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,079
 up I don't care I don't blame you

906
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,500
I am a safe person you can talk to

907
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,579
um my homepage is in Norwegian so

908
00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:34,680
you know you have translators but

909
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,859
LinkedIn and email and Instagram Twitter

910
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:41,220
is much easier to reach me and I have to

911
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,800
say thank you so much and I'm sorry if I

912
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,440
ruined your mood

913
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,200
uh but thank you so much

914
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,359
thank you a lot for this presentation

915
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:56,840
[Applause]

916
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,618
so we'll take a few questions someone

917
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,140
is someone up there

918
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:10,759
up and uh

919
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,260
nothing is secure

920
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,300
well

921
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,099
um Tick Tock first of all I don't have

922
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:25,560
data installed on my phone

923
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,900
um but when it comes to kids I think

924
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,300
it's really harmful actually but I also

925
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,280
think it can be used to good things if

926
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,839
you use it correctly

927
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,320
as with everything else but I also think

928
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,300
that you should follow

929
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,359
um what people are advising like we have

930
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:46,200
nine-year-olds who post dances online I

931
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,060
think that's weird

932
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,579
I want people to follow the

933
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:52,440
recommendations and to seek more

934
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,599
knowledge of parental controls Snapchat

935
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:56,820
does have some great parental controls

936
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,240
now but it doesn't make it 100 safe but

937
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,060
we can never be 100 safe and I believe

938
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,780
in giving them more and more access and

939
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,040
freedom

940
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,960
over years

941
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,000
so some people say okay they need to be

942
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,280
13 to be on social media people think

943
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,020
it's illegal to have kids on social

944
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,000
media that their country decided this

945
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,460
but it's not about that at all

946
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,599
um

947
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,300
but I really think okay if everyone in

948
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,060
your 10 year old class has Tick Tock

949
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,280
you're gonna be bullied for not having

950
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,960
it and they're gonna say but everyone

951
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,579
else has it

952
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:35,099
so instead of just giving it to them and

953
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,260
let them be alone and watch Tick Tock

954
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,420
for hours be there with them

955
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,940
you can never protect them from harmful

956
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,760
videos or whatever but be there with

957
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,300
them why do we give those kids all of

958
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,460
this um

959
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,079
platforms and iPads and phone yeah

960
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:54,420
because we want some hours alone

961
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,540
you know kids they bother you you know

962
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,160
you want some free time and you let your

963
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,260
kid go and play fortnite for hours

964
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,480
without checking in on them they need to

965
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,859
know that you're here

966
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:06,960
so if it's safe or not I don't know

967
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,900
nothing is safe really

968
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,339
thank you

969
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,020
yeah other question

970
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,980
what's your view with regards to

971
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,599
advertisement on this social media let

972
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:26,280
me tell you a quick story I have two

973
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,920
young children they like to watch some

974
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,680
uh some couple of things on YouTube yeah

975
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,140
through the TV they don't need to be

976
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,300
logged in they just know where they want

977
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,040
to look so they look what they are

978
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,960
supposed to look but the problem is they

979
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,420
get advertisement yeah definitely not

980
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,160
suitable for them

981
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,160
yeah advertisement on the videos yeah

982
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,099
before during after yeah

983
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:53,460
so uh YouTube started out really great

984
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:55,740
but together with all great things of

985
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,140
course they want to earn more money than

986
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:02,700
they already have so they added ads and

987
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,800
then now you have to pay to not get the

988
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,040
ads but you also can use some ad

989
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:11,339
blockers you have a YouTube ad blockers

990
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,280
that does exist and you can also use the

991
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,900
the brave

992
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,300
um

993
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,520
one as well and and yeah it forces

994
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,339
people to buy premium and I think it's

995
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:24,420
really bad

996
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,400
not everyone can afford it even though

997
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,500
it's not that expensive they're still

998
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,339
getting the ads

999
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,200
thank you very much for this

1000
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,720
presentation I'm here I'm working for a

1001
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,099
company which has something like 20 000

1002
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:50,400
people so I'm less young people but the

1003
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,839
problematic you describe here we see

1004
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,579
also very often with older people so

1005
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:54,900
they all also dinosaurs who are

1006
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,339
struggling the same thing so let me ask

1007
00:43:56,339 --> 00:43:58,319
this question about dinosaur I'm a

1008
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,960
customer of a front of orange France and

1009
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,540
when I go to your company and going

1010
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,760
through the web pages I feel also a

1011
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,819
dinosaur and I feel I'm I'm a little bit

1012
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,460
older than 30 but younger I'm feeling

1013
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,160
younger than 30 in my in my soul

1014
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,760
um if I go to Orange I feel also being

1015
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,339
not understood so what is your company's

1016
00:44:20,339 --> 00:44:23,160
stake to your presentation do they act

1017
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,500
do they will change something I can't

1018
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,160
speak on behalf of the whole company but

1019
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,160
it's the same message to everyone

1020
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,280
even my company other companies

1021
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,859
um also I sometimes can browse our pages

1022
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:40,319
and other customers pages and don't

1023
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,220
understand but at least in Norway they

1024
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,319
are asking me for opinions because we

1025
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:48,540
have the for example the Norwegian or

1026
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:51,560
cyber defense page and I I told her like

1027
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,560
uh I think this was not good and then

1028
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,599
they actually asked me and then asked

1029
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,660
for help to make things more

1030
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,480
understanding also if I do a pen test

1031
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,420
for a customer I think I sometimes

1032
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,700
struggle when I read like yeah this is

1033
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:10,800
what we deliver okay

1034
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,980
and I I told my manager like ah I don't

1035
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,280
think this explains good enough what I

1036
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,740
deliver because I don't get it myself

1037
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,740
and then they said okay but write it

1038
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,420
yourself and we'll work on it together

1039
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,540
so I think each country needs to look

1040
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,880
into their sites but at least we we have

1041
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,400
done it in uh in Norway and I'm really

1042
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,099
happy that I get to contribute to make

1043
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,079
it more understanding

1044
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,140
and yeah you can contact me if it's

1045
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,420
something you're struggling with I know

1046
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,400
I quit Orange

1047
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:47,060
good

1048
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:53,640
anyone else yeah

1049
00:46:04,819 --> 00:46:07,920
what do you consider a suitable age for

1050
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,880
a kid to receive his or her first phone

1051
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:14,880
for first Paul smartphone I think you

1052
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,000
could start with the watches

1053
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,420
so first phone smartphone

1054
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:25,319
I think we need to see the um what age

1055
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:26,940
they're getting it I think you also need

1056
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:29,160
to consider you know your own child I

1057
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,160
don't some children are 18 in their head

1058
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:35,400
some some are 10 as as with us uh

1059
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,440
grown-ups I think that's something that

1060
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,020
people need to consider

1061
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:43,980
how grown up is my kid is this kid is he

1062
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:47,280
12 or is he a bit Childress still

1063
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,200
I think it's really diff

1064
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,480
um a lot of the difference but as I

1065
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,940
mentioned as well I think we should let

1066
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:55,859
them get more and more access to things

1067
00:46:55,859 --> 00:46:58,140
you know if you're uh teaching your

1068
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:00,720
child to ride a bike you won't place

1069
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,300
them on a bike and yeah have a nice ride

1070
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,359
you have these wheels on the side and we

1071
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,099
should do the same with phones you could

1072
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:09,900
go through with your internet provider

1073
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:11,339
to block

1074
00:47:11,339 --> 00:47:13,740
Omega Chatroulette but let's say bad

1075
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,160
pages and then you can first of course

1076
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,900
get knowledge about the parental

1077
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,540
controls on for example iPhone

1078
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,160
and even though they have this

1079
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,319
Smartphone maybe you could start up with

1080
00:47:25,319 --> 00:47:27,780
rules so screen time

1081
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,540
and also that they just use this if they

1082
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,359
are actually going out or when you are

1083
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:35,579
there to see what is going on and start

1084
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,200
that and then give them more and more

1085
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,900
freedom on and access

1086
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,540
I did ask because a multi-factor

1087
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:45,420
authentication is almost all versions

1088
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:49,460
today based on owning a phone

1089
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,220
you have SMS you have applications but

1090
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:55,740
every multi-factor requires to have a

1091
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,060
phone

1092
00:47:57,060 --> 00:48:00,240
you can also have it an app on for

1093
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,119
example an iPad

1094
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:05,280
but but then of course you don't it's

1095
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,440
almost the same but it's not the phone

1096
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,280
but but yeah yeah I uh I agree uh on

1097
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,500
that as well maybe there's better way

1098
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,640
for kids

1099
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,560
I don't know

1100
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,380
I hope they will find out

1101
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,300
good point

1102
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,980
any other question

1103
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,099
are you guys not sick of me yet

1104
00:48:28,099 --> 00:48:30,540
hasn't it long been a long day I'm

1105
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,940
stoked I'm glad you're asking questions

1106
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,040
just a clarification on the previous

1107
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,640
question you do not need a phone for 2fa

1108
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,839
you can have dotp codes on a smartwatch

1109
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,640
yeah without having the Smartwatch

1110
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,800
connected to a phone and there are

1111
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,740
security Keys like ubcs which are in

1112
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,740
fact the only unfishable ones yeah it

1113
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:58,079
should be thought and whatever so yeah

1114
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,599
and some two factors also are on the

1115
00:49:00,599 --> 00:49:03,599
email so maybe parents could help them

1116
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,339
