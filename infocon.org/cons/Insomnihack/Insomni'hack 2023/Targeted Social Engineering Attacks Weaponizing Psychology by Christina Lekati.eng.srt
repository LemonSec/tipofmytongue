1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,480
okay this talk is about target targeted

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,400
social engineering attacks how

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,320
psychology is being weaponized against

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,639
people but really it's also about what's

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,820
coming what we have been observing in

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,560
the sphere of social engineering attacks

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,080
how the attacks have been evolving and

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,880
what we will have to face in the coming

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,420
coming years we already see different

10
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,820
types of attacks we will see more of

11
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,098
those in the years to come

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,020
let's face a couple of words about me

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,780
who am I to talk about that my name is

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,420
Christina lecate I have a background and

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,399
degree in Psychology but I have been

16
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,980
working in cyber security

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,239
specifically I have been working for a

18
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,260
cyber is based in Zurich as a trainer

19
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,719
and consultant on the human element of

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,640
cyber security

21
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,379
I have been conducting the social

22
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,360
engineering awareness training trainings

23
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,640
for the both for the board of directors

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,000
we specialize in custom

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,040
specialized trainings for specific needs

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,260
but I'm also the lead investigator when

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,939
it comes to open source intelligence

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,920
vulnerability assessment for high value

29
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,619
targets and corporations

30
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,020
last I have been a very happy and proud

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,439
member for the ocean curious project

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,540
but let's Dive Right In we start with

33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,600
the case a case that we had the luck to

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,520
have a reported case on these types of

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,400
attacks this came from proof Point uh

36
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,840
it's a very good report if you want to

37
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,759
read it the link is there

38
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,960
it's about myself Martella Flores a fake

39
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,520
online account

40
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,400
who behind this account actually was a

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,920
state-sponsored trade doctor very well

42
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,100
crafted Facebook profile with this

43
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,700
inviting lady who had a very soft spot

44
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,460
about people working in the Aerospace

45
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,500
defense industry

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,320
most of her contacts were employees and

47
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,880
people working in the airspace defense

48
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,860
industry and

49
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,259
yeah she was connecting with them

50
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,479
talking with them and at some point

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,119
let's say in 2019 with one specific

52
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,940
individual we observed that there was an

53
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:14,940
initial contact friend request he

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,260
accepted

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,420
she stayed there didn't do anything for

56
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,640
one full year in fact it's one of the

57
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,860
very few long-term social engineering

58
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,020
attacks we have been observing and fun

59
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,640
fact these are the types of attacks that

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
we had so many people thinking oh this

61
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,420
would never happen

62
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,879
but it happens a lot more than we think

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,099
it doesn't see the light of day that

64
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,000
often

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,680
so for one full year she didn't do

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,660
anything why

67
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,580
we

68
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,720
2020 November 2020 almost many months

69
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,480
after she initiates contact with her

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,580
Target that individual we are examining

71
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,560
the report

72
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,780
um based on just one common interest

73
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,760
something they were both interested in

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,660
he responds he likes it let's also think

75
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,420
it was November 2020 the time of the

76
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,239
pandemic where everybody was a bit home

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,099
and alone

78
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,379
I they started talking they started

79
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,599
building a relationship escalating from

80
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,360
one social media platform to to the

81
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,940
phone WhatsApp messaging exchanging

82
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,900
little pictures exchanging little videos

83
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,000
having nice conversation and that goes

84
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,040
on for eight months

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,920
eight months for a social engineering

86
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:34,140
campaign uh wasting so much time why we

87
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,819
will see

88
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,620
but here's the first thing we have been

89
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,540
observing in the way social engineering

90
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:42,060
attacks have evolved and in the way they

91
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,540
are starting to go

92
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,120
they are not this quick hit and runs

93
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,879
anymore and they do start targeting more

94
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,819
and more what people want and what

95
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,140
people need

96
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,540
we have massillos higher here of needs

97
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,000
and we see that yeah we all need to feel

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,940
love and affection we all need to feel a

99
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,340
sense of belonging with one another we

100
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,260
need a Social Circle that's going to be

101
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,599
around for us and that raises our

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
self-esteem that makes us feel confident

103
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,640
that is a reliable

104
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,358
uh listening ear a shoulder to lean on

105
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:21,660
is this a human weakness we have been

106
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,060
hearing so often this um

107
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,220
the same thing again and again all

108
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,860
people are the human the weakest link of

109
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,800
security uh they you cannot but stupid

110
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,220
but is it stupid to just have your human

111
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,020
nature and have social engineering

112
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,820
trying to exploit it this is the name of

113
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,620
the game it's not about people being

114
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,040
stupid it's the simple fact that we are

115
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,800
humans and some will try to exploit our

116
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,199
human nature

117
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,440
so yeah sure we still have a lot of the

118
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,199
facing Hit and Run campaigns the ones

119
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,320
that have time pressure the classic

120
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,139
funny looking email address from the

121
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,860
sender the the awkward grammar yeah we

122
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,600
still get those and where I keep going

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,280
to getting those these are not going out

124
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,560
of fashion all of a sudden because they

125
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,699
still work

126
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:15,000
but we also see that

127
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,699
Sam some organizations have started to

128
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:20,460
become a bit more sophisticated they

129
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,740
start to recognize them but we also see

130
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,300
the attackers evolving into a more

131
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,460
elaborate campaigns because they are

132
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,220
much more successful ones that involve

133
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,580
longer reconnaissance ones that have a

134
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,919
more tailor than personalized approach

135
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:37,380
to them so not just these random numbers

136
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,500
game phishing emails being sent out or

137
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,940
those um

138
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,220
rather standard spearfishing they're

139
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,320
really really tailored

140
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
they use more elaborate mind games they

141
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,080
exploit our psychological nature and

142
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,780
slowly we start seeing deep fakes

143
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,240
getting into the mix as well

144
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,380
and we see those especially from

145
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,820
state-sponsored threat actors

146
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,979
now if some of you are in companies that

147
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,460
belong to the highest risk profile

148
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,740
the ones that have sensitive research

149
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,820
the ones that belong to the critical

150
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,979
infrastructure yes you should be very

151
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,919
much worried about this

152
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,360
but let's see what happened with

153
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
somebody yeah she was talking with that

154
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,960
person for eight months how did this

155
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,620
conclude well in the report and what

156
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,240
ends up in the report are the results

157
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,400
like just the fact and there are a lot

158
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,220
of uh things that happen in between the

159
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,020
airlines that get missed so in in the

160
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,539
end my sailor sent out an email they

161
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,220
were talking about the pandemic they

162
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,840
were talking about diets and she said

163
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,539
hey my dear

164
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,120

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,680
loud you should fill out your

166
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,360

00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,100
Google Drive Link

172
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,100
uh send me soon thanks for your kindness

173
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:06,180
and your participation cheers Mercy let

174
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,440
me tell you of course there was some

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,860
flirting added to the mix

176
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,860
but so he did he said yeah I'm gonna

177
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,380
help this friend and who knows what it

178
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,699
is

179
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,860
um I'm gonna help her out she clicked on

180
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,599
the link yes there was a trusted

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,280
relationship by then which was the whole

182
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,360
point of this engagement lasting so long

183
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,780
and enable the the content downloaded

184
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,940
the macros and eventually downloaded

185
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,699
what was done as the lambo malware which

186
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:37,800
was designed to establish persistence

187
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,020
perform reconnaissance

188
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:43,758
and accelerate sensitive information

189
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,539
and as we say there is this history

190
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:52,620
was there one case scenario was did this

191
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,080
happen just once is it the Black Swan

192
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,400
one of the things that you cannot

193
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,919
anticipate no

194
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,560
this is something that we see happening

195
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,319
a lot but doesn't get out in the news

196
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,900
all that often there were more cases

197
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,440
Facebook reported a whole set of similar

198
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,419
accounts trying to do the same LinkedIn

199
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:14,819
is full of those you probably have heard

200
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:17,819
that there are many many others as well

201
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,060
the kill chain is usually the same they

202
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,000
target specific people in key positions

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,180
they perform long reconnaissance mostly

204
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,860
through social media because social

205
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,379
media is a gift that keeps on giving for

206
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:33,240
reconnaissance and now if you are

207
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,640
wondering what did it take her so long

208
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,360
to establish a connection well they were

209
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,200
studying their targets and they do study

210
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,420
their targets nowadays

211
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,040
so yes of course then you have the

212
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,839
online Persona which is the medium

213
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,680
through which the attack can happen

214
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,720
the approach is personalized like we

215
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,580
said and very very often we see them

216
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,260
escalating their targets from one

217
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,060
platform to another to appear more

218
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,339
legitimate than believable Facebook from

219
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,260
Facebook to LinkedIn to a missed

220
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,060
Instagram because if you have an online

221
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,120
presence you must be a real person no

222
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,100
a of course then eventually to Whatsapp

223
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,720
phone numbers email addresses work email

224
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,100
perfect

225
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,620
and through this casual relationship

226
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,720
building that looks a lot like the way

227
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,600
we make friends in everyday life they

228
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,820
take the stress building and explode it

229
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,620
exploit in a very

230
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,019
regular casual everyday manner nothing

231
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,040
out of the ordinary

232
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,000
these were the details you don't have to

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,860
read them whoever wants the slides can

234
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,380
ask me for them after the talk and I

235
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,300
will be happy to email them to you or

236
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,880
send them

237
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
but

238
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,120
or they all have common common

239
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,160
characteristics the end the difference

240
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,620
is only like in the exploitation how

241
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,959
they decide to exploit the contact did

242
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,700
they want to harvest great danger other

243
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,220
times they want to to send out a

244
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,320
malicious email that downloads malware

245
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,300
and of course the goal sometimes differs

246
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,360
this way most of the times the case is

247
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,220
epic what's behind it is an Espionage

248
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,140
operation and they need to collect

249
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,800
sensitive information

250
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:21,180
why go through all these tables for so

251
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,760
long what do they gain out of it what

252
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,399
what is it in there for them because

253
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,620
don't forget threat actors they also

254
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,420
care about return of investment they

255
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,820
care about how they spend their time so

256
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:35,940
yeah there is the case where there's an

257
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,860
attack that harvests credentials in the

258
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,100
end or malware infection but this whole

259
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,980
time there is also an effort to elicit

260
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,860
sensitive information human intelligence

261
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,380
tactics that we used to see in Espionage

262
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,959
operations are now happening in

263
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:54,000
cyberspace through virtual human

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,220
intelligence operations through these

265
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,320
fake profiles through casual

266
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,980
conversation whose goal is to blending

267
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,440
specific Target equations we're going to

268
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,779
talk about that a little bit later but

269
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:09,839
yeah eight months Marcela Flores took

270
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,360
eight months to exploit the relationship

271
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,079
imagine how much informations you gained

272
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,940
on the target that time

273
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,100
about Technologies about things that are

274
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,140
happening at work I've seen these

275
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,660
conversations and

276
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,600
people talk

277
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,700
of course in other cases we also have

278
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,920
inside their thread grooming this is not

279
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,200
random they spot the ones that are

280
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,620
unhappy at work that have needs in life

281
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,779
that a third doctor or some more money

282
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:42,360
could failing and by establishing a

283
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,339
connection in a relationship eventually

284
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:47,600
they groom them into willful

285
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,940
knowledgeable Insider threads

286
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,740
again

287
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,480
it supports long-term Espionage

288
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,820
operations as well but once you have a

289
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,959
connection with someone in a key

290
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,240
position imagination is the limit any

291
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,459
number of things can happen and what we

292
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:04,140
know about social engineering is that

293
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,699
there are no rules

294
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,260
and this is the whole point of

295
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,540
weaponizing psychology

296
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,700
yes we deal with a lot of technical

297
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,040
challenges and we must it's an essential

298
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
part of the work but this is also a

299
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,320
behavioral problem how do you go around

300
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,940
telling your employees you shouldn't

301
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,880
talk to strangers you should keep a

302
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,680
secret secret

303
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,100
this is a behavioral issue employees and

304
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,440
managers that can provide access to

305
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,620
technology information or assets become

306
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,820
targets

307
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:41,880
and they have the responsibility to

308
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,760
protect those assets can they do it do

309
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,839
they have the skills and knowledge

310
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,440
necessary to detect those attacks

311
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,480
not always

312
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,940
and that's the thing cyber security and

313
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,519
security technology has been advancing

314
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,220
but identifying and exploiting human

315
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:02,279
vulnerabilities also human psychology it

316
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,800
has remained the same across centuries

317
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,959
and across the Globes

318
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,540
the human stimulus response in human

319
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,700
triggers is consistent

320
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,459
and exploiting these figures is also

321
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:17,339
consistently successful and if you just

322
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,139
think about it from the side of the

323
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,500
threat actors it's efficient it is low

324
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,079
cost it is low risk

325
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,600
and it's high reward because

326
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
it works consistently

327
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,820
is it that hard to find somebody's unmet

328
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,220
needs is it that hard to find this one

329
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,440
thing that triggers them

330
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,120
no

331
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,579
we said before that social media is a

332
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:48,240
gift that keeps on giving we can scout

333
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,760
somebody's digital footprint and we do

334
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,260
that when we conduct vulnerability

335
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,019
assessments and find exactly what makes

336
00:13:55,019 --> 00:13:57,839
them tick because they share it either

337
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,060
explicitly or implicitly in one way or

338
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,339
another or another if there is a digital

339
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,220
footprint there will be traces of

340
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,320
behavioral patterns as well

341
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,720
people that are that have addictions

342
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,579
people that need more money for whatever

343
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:15,180
reasons for reason people that are

344
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:18,000
lonely a very human thing these are all

345
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,399
gaps and needs that the third actor can

346
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
spot and try to see

347
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,279
and since I have conducted this profiles

348
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,459
on high value targets again these are

349
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,060
the sum of the data points that we have

350
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:35,639
found we can collect on individuals

351
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,100
only from social media profiles yeah the

352
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,019
locations where do they go where do they

353
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,120
frequent do they go to the gym every so

354
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,800
often do you think attacks only happen

355
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,199
during office hours

356
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:48,120
no they also happen at the gym they

357
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,279
happen at the golf club they happen

358
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,420
annually at conferences during travel

359
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:56,820
you have this danger that's suddenly

360
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,639
comes in and starts talking to you

361
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,800
we see what their connections are who

362
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,660
are they key people who do they trust do

363
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,000
they have a family are they lonely they

364
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,820
have nobody did they just divorce

365
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,620
all these are the points that are

366
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,380
collected and could be weaponized

367
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,060
against them in one way or another and

368
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,079
then of course you have the whole

369
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,820
psychological profile you see these

370
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,639
individuals are they extroverted again

371
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,459
there is no problem with you having an

372
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:25,920
online presence

373
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,260
but the point is you need to know where

374
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,180
to draw the boundaries when you

375
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,279
communicate with others especially when

376
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:34,920
it comes to practicing certain cyber

377
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,180
security Habits Like downloading

378
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,980
attachments or disclosing sensitive

379
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,079
information

380
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:44,940
because I know this sounds a bit too

381
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,399
much it is too much

382
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,639
people say against State actors with

383
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,440
spots if you're an extrovert if you're

384
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,940
willing to talk to others which is

385
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,980
perfectly fine they will try to exploit

386
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,680
it though what are your interests what

387
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,760
do you want what do you miss

388
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,800
they go like that

389
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,019
but let's go back to sensitive

390
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,720
information because I feel this gets a

391
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,519
bit overlooked at times

392
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,160
and yes there is a digital layer to what

393
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,380
happens with information but there is

394
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,000
also the human layer of what happens

395
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,399
with information the people that know

396
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,800
about things

397
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,260
it has a very high value think about

398
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,060
business plans strategies biddings

399
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,399
negotiation strategies

400
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,800
also credentials of course also

401
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,540
passwords and access to Systems

402
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,560
Technology and giving entry but yeah

403
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,600
according to the U.S Department of

404
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,759
Defense classified information on the

405
00:16:44,759 --> 00:16:46,560
unauthorized disclosure of classified

406
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,500
information is a communication or

407
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,360
physical transfer of classified

408
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
information or controlled unclassified

409
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,399
information to an unauthorized recipient

410
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,699
and this can happen intentionally in the

411
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,759
case of a mistake or in the case of an

412
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,500
Insider thread but it can also happen

413
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,780
unintentionally

414
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,660
when an individual releases this

415
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,760
information out of you and draws them

416
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,559
out in a casual conversation

417
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,260
it has many attackers like cyber

418
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,900
criminal organizations

419
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,000
activists that oppose your company's

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,959
moves and what your company stands for

421
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
nation states with a geopolitical agenda

422
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,660
journalists that want to to get a good

423
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,299
story out of your business operation and

424
00:17:36,299 --> 00:17:38,700
corporate espionage operatives

425
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,440
again it's not in everybody's straight

426
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,419
model but

427
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:45,360
critical organizations will belong to

428
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,600
the critical infrastructure are an

429
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,220
extremely attractive Target for these

430
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,919
types of operations

431
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,059
it's like another case study Mia us

432
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,400
who was a fake profile again behind this

433
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,860
fake profile was another state-sponsored

434
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,500
fit doctor likely called kobal tipsy

435
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,419
telecommunications government defense

436
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,880
oil and financial services organizations

437
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,000
in Middle East and North Africa now

438
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,460
miyash was not the original plan the

439
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,039
original plan was simply to send out a

440
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:24,240
set of fixing emails the numbers game

441
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,820
um yeah massively to a number of

442
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,340
individuals it would eventually deliver

443
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,580
a remote access tool

444
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,039
um but this didn't work they sent out

445
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
the phishing email it was royally

446
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,960
unsuccessful and they thought okay

447
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,700
we need the plan B we need to do

448
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,580
something better what would that be and

449
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,840
it was me

450
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,240
it was this

451
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,340
sweet Persona that you see on your

452
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:53,059
screen right now

453
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,840
side note it's not only women targeted

454
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,760
men they are also males targeting women

455
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,160
it just happens to be that the ones that

456
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,160
are public right now happen to be women

457
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,679
female profiles are getting men but it

458
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:13,380
can happen to anybody it can happen to

459
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,660
all types of individuals no matter what

460
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,940
their preferences are

461
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,700
so me as again fake identity using

462
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,700
several social media accounts use and

463
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,400
she was used to perform reconnaissance

464
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,620
to collect information on the targets

465
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,140
and to establish their relationship with

466
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,840
them

467
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,500
based on specific Hobbies once again

468
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,140
see who the start the conversation based

469
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,720
on their common interest in photography

470
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,940
and then it would escalate like we said

471
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,340
before to other profiles to different

472
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:50,160
communication methods

473
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,020
um and you should build a relationship

474
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,820
very casually

475
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,520
and once the email work the working mail

476
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,340
was provided so you would find a rules

477
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,840
she would say something like hey I

478
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,360
really want to deliver my portfolio to

479
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,760
this Challenge and

480
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,280
I would appreciate nothing more than

481
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,160
your opinion can you quickly take it I

482
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,100
have like a 10 minute window to submit

483
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,140
it I was so stressed out to send it out

484
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,280
and now I'm running late with my

485
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,380
deadline uh yes but I'm at work it will

486
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,000
only take five minutes I just want your

487
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,559
precious opinion

488
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,320
the targets downloaded it was like an

489
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,660
extremely successful attack they

490
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,720
downloaded the the attachment and the

491
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,179
remote access tool was delivered to

492
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:35,780
their machines

493
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,820
what a mess

494
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:43,020
and how do we defend against this threat

495
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,500
as a general rule there are no rules and

496
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,220
no one is exam that goes to say that oh

497
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,580
everybody needs to know

498
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,940
basic cyber security

499
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:59,580
uh habits good cyber security habits and

500
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,120
apply them from from the services the

501
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,280
call center that has certain access

502
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,919
information to the high value targets to

503
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,980
the people higher up in higher hue

504
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,200
we talked about elicitation how does

505
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,760
this work yeah we say that schedule

506
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,620
conversation but

507
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,799
there is a technique behind it

508
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,840
a hesitation is an effort in which

509
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,059
seemingly normal conversation is

510
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,100
contrived to extract sensitive

511
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,799
information about individuals their work

512
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,500
and their colleagues how does it sound

513
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,320
like three of the most popular methods

514
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,120
are flattering

515
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,539
this oh you are the only one who can

516
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,640
help me with this one thing that I need

517
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,340
and I value your opinion so much please

518
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,679
help me

519
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,020
flattery second is the familiarity and

520
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,760
the tribe insect

521
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,220
this wasn't another case hey we are both

522
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,500
in the same industry so from one it pro

523
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,900
to another what do you think about this

524
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,159
technology

525
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:01,260
I don't know I just I just cannot bring

526
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,000
myself to decide whether I want to buy

527
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,419
it for our organization have you used it

528
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:08,280
was it good do you have some something

529
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,960
else to recommend

530
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,240
I'm just so lost

531
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,700
that's an elicitation technique

532
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,400
and then the third one empathy and the

533
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,380
tendency to complain the tendency to

534
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,000
want to share our programs with others

535
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,059
which is perfectly fine but if

536
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:25,919
they contain sensitive for information

537
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,260
to ask it to the people that can be

538
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:30,059
trusted with it

539
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,059
so it goes like this oh you had a

540
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:36,139
terribly day at work

541
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,179
I know I had one too my boss I don't

542
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,280
know it's just cannot understand the

543
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,679
demands of my work but I'll tell you

544
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,419
about it but first about you what

545
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:46,919
happened

546
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:48,720
oh

547
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,179
yeah oh you have this acquisition your

548
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,820
stressed yeah we had one too what's

549
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:57,240
going on okay maybe I can help

550
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,360
elicitation technique

551
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,539
it's not unknown in the field of

552
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,380
Espionage we are seeing more Espionage

553
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,320
techniques coming and have adapting to

554
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,960
the cyber security

555
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,700
industry to cyber attacks

556
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,440
the defense counterintelligence and

557
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,900
Security Agency gives guidelines on

558
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,080
those but three main rules we don't have

559
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,780
to over complicating things three main

560
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,580
rules to avoid being a victim of

561
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,340
elicitation techniques is knowing what

562
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,400
information should not be shared

563
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,679
being suspicious of the people who ask

564
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,200
or pray around this information

565
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,460
sometimes when you don't answer the

566
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,440
first time around you will notice that

567
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,200
they persist no really tell me now I

568
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,299
really need to know

569
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,400
and you will notice that they have a

570
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,980
particular interest eventually

571
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:54,179
and yes simple do not tell people of

572
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,100
things they are not authorized to know

573
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,080
even the defense content intelligence

574
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,659
Security Agency they say they say it so

575
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,380
simply don't tell people uh that they're

576
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,600
not authorized to know things that they

577
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,620
are not supposed to know

578
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,360
high value targets the executives

579
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,700
they sometimes need to be handled

580
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,220
differently both because they have an

581
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,340
extremely high they have elevated access

582
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,039
to Information Systems of everything

583
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,299
so they are lucrative targets but they

584
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:31,980
also need to be handled differently

585
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:34,080
sometimes

586
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,140
when we work a vulnerability provides on

587
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,460
them and if you need to run

588
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,380
vulnerability profile on them how do you

589
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,419
do it what do you focus on

590
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,880
five main areas what is the criticality

591
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,559
of the role

592
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,419
are they what's their degree of

593
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:50,220
importance what happens if they get

594
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:52,260
compromised to a whole lot of things go

595
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,360
wrong after that this is what

596
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,000
criticality points you to so that you

597
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,860
can prioritize a little bit because we

598
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,440
cannot we cannot be everywhere for

599
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,360
everyone and you know

600
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,400
we are limited in terms of resources as

601
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,200
well what's their level of

602
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,820
recognizability do they have a public

603
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:11,159
profile and by the way by high value

604
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,840
targets I don't normally mean Executives

605
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
these are also the people that work in

606
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,179
sensitive projects

607
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,880
are they recognizable would you be able

608
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,220
to find information on them online would

609
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:25,500
not necessary be able to find out who

610
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,840
they are who are the key people working

611
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,600
in key positions and what is the what

612
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,940
informations out there about them

613
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,600
accessibility is the ease of approach so

614
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,760
if I know they are critical and I know

615
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,380
who they are

616
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,200
can I spot them at the conference okay

617
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,179
nice spot them at the gym can I approach

618
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,919
them online

619
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,480
do they talk do they engage with

620
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,520
strangers online would they have a good

621
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,260
chance with them

622
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:55,220
and to that place in the their level of

623
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,200
vulnerability as well do I see clear

624
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,539
weaknesses on that individuals like the

625
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:03,240
ones we talked about before do I see

626
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,980
something that I could readily explode

627
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,440
your adverses will go through this

628
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,500
process and you see they did

629
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:15,179
and last the key piece if they do

630
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,880
receive this type of attack

631
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,340
or they've been knowledgeable enough to

632
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:23,640
detect it or know how to handle it or

633
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,640
would they get lost or possibly not

634
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,320
recognize it

635
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,539
uh one important thing is that these

636
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:33,240
attacks play a lot on ignorance like

637
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,980
most social engineering attacks if you

638
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,659
don't know what the threats or danger

639
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,520
looks like you cannot protect against it

640
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,919
it's a thing how many of you have

641
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,020
educated your boards on these types of

642
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,940
threads or an instantly Security in

643
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,240
general I know that some of you probably

644
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,919
have to deal with boards and Executives

645
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:55,919
that say oh no no no no no no uh

646
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,840
ignorance is bliss knowledge is a

647
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,659
liability I don't want to hear any of

648
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,279
this I don't want to hear about the

649
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,900
threats I would never be a Target leave

650
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,820
me alone I have other things too other

651
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,320
more important things

652
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,600
to pay attention to like my profit

653
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,980
please

654
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,200
but there are also the boards that are

655
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,840
interested they want and they need to

656
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,240
know about these threads or when you

657
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,000
when you're facing resistance again

658
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,179
don't drop it we should in this is about

659
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,840
their safety the organization's safety I

660
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,020
think we should insist a little bit on

661
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,760
on getting the message through to them

662
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:36,260
on why cyber security matters

663
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,740
some others will think

664
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,260
this is a way to advance our employees

665
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,140
fall for the simplest fishing attacks I

666
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,360
cannot bother with targeted email

667
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,600
attacks as well I forget it

668
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,179
no I need to come too complicated what

669
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:55,860
am I gonna do go around and tell people

670
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,380
not to talk to strangers

671
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,260
it's not about that

672
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,400
first of all it's not obvious simplified

673
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,679
complicated threats reports that come

674
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,240
out about social engineering for example

675
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,400
they have for the sake of word count

676
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,860
they have to say that phishing emails is

677
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,299
a top threat

678
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,700
but you see that the way this fishing

679
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,880
email is being delivered also matters to

680
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,880
its effectiveness

681
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,480
so and it's also not

682
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,919
oversimplify now over complicate Simple

683
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,080
Solutions in the end of the day

684
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,720
they need to know what to protect and

685
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,640
where the boundaries are you don't have

686
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,679
to go around and tell them stop talking

687
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,600
to everybody online but you have to tell

688
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,240
them now that what should not be shared

689
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,960
and do not share it for reasons ABCD

690
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,659
I know how to exercise basic cyber

691
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,419
security habits and stick with them and

692
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:56,279
the way you deliver this message also

693
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:57,960
matters I believe the keynote speaker

694
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,880
earlier today mentioned a little

695
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,340
something about

696
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,900
providing very boring video trainings

697
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,460
that people just want to click through

698
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,320
and they eventually get totally fed up

699
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,400
with hearing about cyber security

700
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
because it's all being a drug and a

701
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,559
necessary evil a necessity they have to

702
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,260
go and click through the slides and

703
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,820
click through the videos while they have

704
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,919
other things to do

705
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,440
no you can provide something more

706
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,600
engaging for them and we should do that

707
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,880
as an industry

708
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,500
and if your employees are safe or

709
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,880
anything for them

710
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,279
simply facing image and this is still a

711
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,740
problem don't just let it be we have to

712
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,899
do something about it attacks are not

713
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:39,240
going to get any simpler they become

714
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,919
more complicated and more advanced and

715
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:42,779
we have to be able to catch up one way

716
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,779
or another as a as an industry

717
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:48,299
it's not a

718
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,360
it's not an unusual I say that might not

719
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,760
happen the probabilities are high that

720
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,080
you will encounter it so yeah

721
00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:00,000
in most case scenarios what have people

722
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,580
that fail victims to cyber attacks

723
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,200
whether this was an elicitation

724
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,140
technique somebody malicious engaging

725
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,539
them online and then falling for it or

726
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,539
spearfishing emails they say and these

727
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,679
are very common quotes by the way oh uh

728
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,320
yeah I thought that something was off I

729
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,360
was not really sure how to respond in

730
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,860
this pair of the moment I just went with

731
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,080
it

732
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,880
that's because of bad training usually

733
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,460
oh yeah I spotted it but then what I I

734
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:31,860
learned about the threads but

735
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:35,880
how do I handle it once the person is

736
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,100
pressuring me

737
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:42,299
that's bad training I others say oh yeah

738
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,000
so it happened I downloaded the file I

739
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,559
knew it was bad but I didn't report it

740
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,020
because I I think they could be

741
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,460
implicated and I didn't want to get

742
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,659
fired

743
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,600
what a bad message what about security

744
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,600
culture it's Such a Pity if your

745
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,980
employees think the thing that's

746
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,320
reporting it we jeopardize their curries

747
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,860
instead of saving their organization

748
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:08,059
that has to do with again

749
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:10,620
awareness but also your cyber security

750
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,940
culture

751
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,940
other other people say I was under a lot

752
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:17,480
of time pressure and my manager was not

753
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,700
appreciate that verification call

754
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,740
why does your manager think that it's

755
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,600
not important to verify certain requests

756
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,000
you see you see the quotes and you spot

757
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,520
the weaknesses that you need to work on

758
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,799
I don't expect anybody to have the

759
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,600
perfect plan and not to have any

760
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,760
weaknesses but these are things we need

761
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,179
to work on security is a process

762
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:45,059
but we have to do something about this

763
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,340
process and not just let things be

764
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,940
and yes I oh it did not even cross my

765
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,640
mind that I could actually be a Target

766
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,919
I'm not that important

767
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,080
there is a lot of bad training there is

768
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,299
also a bad cyber security culture or

769
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:02,520
just doing like 15 minutes per year on

770
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,260
what social engineering attacks are and

771
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,460
how they work

772
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,659
in an effective way

773
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,399
if I had only five tips for the

774
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,460
employees they would be yes technology

775
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,220
is still important it does matter to

776
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,140
minimize employee decision making and

777
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,179
use the principle of least privilege

778
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,279
when possible but it's not going to be

779
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,799
enough because we see that retractors

780
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,740
Target them through private channels

781
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,140
so then on top of that good quality

782
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,299
training that actively engages people

783
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,580
that doesn't have them sit passively

784
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,200
behind the screen and just clicking

785
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,159
through clicking through clicking

786
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,380
through but actively engages them and

787
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,760
makes them interested in what's

788
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,679
happening because they are personally

789
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,679
implicated that would go a long way and

790
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,179
seriously if you're going to spend that

791
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:50,760
money on awareness training make it

792
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,500
worth it get something that's

793
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,340
Interactive

794
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,100
in extend this will help you reinforce

795
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,840
and security mindset within your

796
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,380
organization you will have a trainer and

797
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,960
Advocate coming and building that

798
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,940
mindset within your employees and saying

799
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,399
when in doubt go to this guy right here

800
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:13,380
who's in your security department and

801
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,240
can talk to you these people are not

802
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,299
strangers they can also communicate with

803
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,039
you I hope you do

804
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,779
and

805
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:24,000
and ask

806
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,860
and in the air I was on a practical

807
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,380
level it helps to run simulations around

808
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,740
exercises and reinforce good practices

809
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,860
for people to know how to in to detect

810
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:37,320
and respond to an attack

811
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,720
if you want to take it a step further do

812
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,460
conduct the vulnerability assessment

813
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,399
open source intelligence is essential to

814
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,799
cyber security both on a corporate level

815
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:48,779
and an individual level for high value

816
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:51,600
targets if you can have a vulnerability

817
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,640
assessment done on them internally or if

818
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,159
you turn external whatever you prefer

819
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,860
based on those five factors we saw

820
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,080
before it's worth it it can go a long

821
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,860
way and you can take the results of that

822
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,539
assessment put them in the report put

823
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:08,520
them in the training that they take and

824
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,540
I guarantee you they will be so much

825
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:15,179
more interested to see that training

826
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,339
that has a vulnerability assessment done

827
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:21,119
on them in a diplomatic and non-usatory

828
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:22,918
manner they will be so much more

829
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:25,980
interested to hear what's happening than

830
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,719
thus getting an out of the box classic

831
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,219
standardized cyber security awareness

832
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,659
training that has

833
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:36,000
some things that relate to them some

834
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,739
things that don't relate to them and in

835
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:39,960
the end of the day I want to do other

836
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,239
things

837
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,480
the good news

838
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,280
neuroplasticity I'm so thankful for this

839
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
part of my studies

840
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,179
so we learned that

841
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,899
our brains are capable of creating new

842
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,420
behavioral Pathways that can become

843
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,839
automatic so for everybody that is

844
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,359
totally frustrated and defeated with the

845
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,020
fact that oh we've done so many security

846
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,820
trainings and the materials just don't

847
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,040
get through this just tells you you need

848
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,540
to find a different way to communicate

849
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:15,060
the material neuroplasticity says that

850
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:19,020
you can teach Old Dogs new tricks you

851
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,660
can create new a new neural Pathways and

852
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,599
if you do it in an engaging way

853
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,480
eventually people will be able to create

854
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,300
automatic mental Pathways they see the

855
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,520
trigger they see the red flag and they

856
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,160
automatically think okay I've heard

857
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,560
about this before I should be careful

858
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,079
let's

859
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,300
stay on the safe side

860
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,800
that's the whole point of

861
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,780
neuroplasticity these things will

862
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,760
eventually become automatic and your

863
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,800
people won't have to spend mental energy

864
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,480
on them I've seen this happening

865
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,920
thankfully there is hope

866
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:57,720
this is a topic that in general explains

867
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,900
both deep and wide

868
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:04,320
we only have a few minutes here but if

869
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,060
you are interested I definitely

870
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,579
recommend you read the excitation guide

871
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:11,160
from the defense counterintelligence and

872
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,980
Security Agency they talk about the

873
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,099
elicitation techniques you could I lent

874
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:19,079
parts from these guys and put them in

875
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,180
your awareness training if you want

876
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,460
or if you're interested in the keychain

877
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,320
and more details about General Social

878
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,420
Engineering attacks I also wrote a more

879
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,180
a length year article that you can also

880
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,820
get some information from

881
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:35,520
overall I hope you take it seriously I

882
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,800
know it's difficult I know it's a

883
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,300
process Nobody's Perfect it's fine

884
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,339
but don't just let it be and don't give

885
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,380
up on your people thinking they are just

886
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,760
useless

887
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,400
there are things we can do

888
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,780
thank you very much for being here

889
00:36:53,780 --> 00:37:00,389
[Applause]

890
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,320
and I think we can take a few questions

891
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,020
while we still have five minutes yes

892
00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:13,079
hi there's one thing I was really

893
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:14,160
interested thank you for the interesting

894
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,300
talk by the way but there's one thing

895
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,940
you said that I want to hear if you

896
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,560
could explain why this is you said that

897
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,240
we should expect more of these attacks

898
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,260
in the future

899
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,640
what are the mechanisms that are driving

900
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,280
that what are the mechanisms of that are

901
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,660
driving an increase

902
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,820
the mechanisms are driving the increase

903
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,020
there they seem to uh reward that they

904
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,560
get the fact that they are successful

905
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,420
makes their doctors say that okay this

906
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,500
is something that works more

907
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,020
consistently so I won't be spending time

908
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,420
and resources on attacks that have a 50

909
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:48,540
rate of success when I can just get this

910
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,400
type of attack that has a way higher

911
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,400
rate of success and I can do more things

912
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,660
with it

913
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:57,660
yes we have been observing it we hear

914
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,940
more and more cases like three or four

915
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,980
years ago we didn't have as many cases

916
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,320
as we have today with people being

917
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,060
approached through social media and

918
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:09,720
getting Pride I to complain for whatever

919
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,240
reason about their companies we see a

920
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,280
lot more of this I think I think they do

921
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,440
it because they say it works and they

922
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,640
see they can do a lot through it

923
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,619
yeah I I got a question I got them in

924
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:24,780
microphone sorry

925
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,420
um I am a pen tester and when I work to

926
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,160
assess vulnerability on the system it's

927
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:32,579
usually not the the one who projects uh

928
00:38:32,579 --> 00:38:35,579
the project but some platforms that are

929
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,500
used to development integration and so

930
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,220
on

931
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:41,940
uh my question is when you do the

932
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,440
vulnerability assessments on human

933
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,780
beings there is not a platform on which

934
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,940
you can test whatever you want because

935
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:51,119
you can do some eventually damages uh

936
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,579
including psychological damages if you

937
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:55,079
try to threaten

938
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:59,099
or try to flirt with someone that is

939
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:02,640
married or I don't know so I believe

940
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,940
that you draw a line somewhere

941
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:09,420
that's real attackers don't so how do

942
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,220
you deal with that and where is the the

943
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:14,520
line you most certainly draw a line you

944
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,760
cannot approach it this is a a fantastic

945
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,859
point of view exactly because we deal

946
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:21,780
with some ethical lines here but this is

947
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,619
why you draw the risk profile and you

948
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:27,359
have the people you explain to the

949
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,520
people why this is important for them

950
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,260
they have to give you their approval on

951
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,000
running a test and using their social

952
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,280
media and they do believe me the ones

953
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,420
that feel uh that understand the threat

954
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,460
and they know what it can mean for them

955
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,740
if they trust the service provider

956
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:46,200
they're going to say please

957
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,660
but of course you ensure confidentiality

958
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:51,119
of course you ensure that you have a

959
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,359
trusting relationship and that you treat

960
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:56,760
them with dignity and respect

961
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,079
but it is it is happening

962
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:03,720
the vulnerability profile uh the risk

963
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,540
profile these things do not you do not

964
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:09,480
have to engage with um with the Target

965
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,920
in a way that involves them

966
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,480
psychologically but you just take out

967
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,099
the information you find online from

968
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,960
their own digital footprint and you tell

969
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,440
them look uh this is one attack Vector

970
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,440
my abc these vulnerabilities this is how

971
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,980
we have been observing three doctors

972
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,720
exploiting this information what do you

973
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,700
want to do you want to eliminate them do

974
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,160
you want to also gain the knowledge that

975
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,060
you might encounter ABC types of attacks

976
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:40,099
this is usually how we go about it

977
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:51,960
they know they will not be they know

978
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,839
they will be researched but not engaged

979
00:40:54,839 --> 00:40:57,020
with

980
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,160
no because you don't ask them to respond

981
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,320
to it you ask them to to give you

982
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,300
permission to go through their digital

983
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,500
footprint

984
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,960
and show them what could be used against

985
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,520
them

986
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,480
so there is

987
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,500
now I'm not gonna chat with them I I

988
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,980
know that if I chat with them and I use

989
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,140
ABCD trigger points they are likely to

990
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,359
respond and this is how we approach it

991
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,320
but you do not have to pair it with them

992
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:37,980
yes I wondered while trying to protect

993
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,220
your company for example

994
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,359
there is

995
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:45,119
we might have a risk maybe to change the

996
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,940
mood inside the company because while

997
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:51,060
saying to people okay be aware

998
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,180
of the question you are asked

999
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,700
they will change their behavior also and

1000
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:59,339
maybe your company might become an

1001
00:41:59,339 --> 00:42:01,200
company less

1002
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,260
friendly regarding the outside and also

1003
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,500
inside there is a

1004
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,140
valid question what happens when we uh

1005
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,140
when we rain threads on our people and

1006
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:15,300
tell them don't don't engage online with

1007
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,260
strangers but this is exactly where the

1008
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,800
danger yeah lies you do not want to tell

1009
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,140
them remove your social media profile

1010
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,060
don't talk with anyone online no it's

1011
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:30,660
what the what we talked about

1012
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,220
right here from the defense

1013
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,900
counterintelligence and Security Agency

1014
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:36,000
talk with them talk with everybody have

1015
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,220
your online profile but

1016
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,859
nowhere to when to draw their boundaries

1017
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:43,320
and what boundaries to draw what does

1018
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,060
that person that is talking with you

1019
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,000
what shouldn't they know about your

1020
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,180
company and maintain that boundary

1021
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:53,640
in a healthy way

1022
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,040
that's what it is about because of

1023
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,859
course many of us need to have many

1024
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:00,540
companies as well they need to have an

1025
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,940
online presence they need to engage with

1026
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,680
customers online or with Partners

1027
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:08,099
business partners but the boundaries

1028
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:11,640
this is a my last point we talked about

1029
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,940
not over complicating our Solutions in

1030
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,339
the end it is about maintaining

1031
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:20,960
security best practices

1032
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,740
thank you

1033
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,460
yes we can have one more

1034
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,859
you choose

1035
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,619
I'll take one thank you very much for an

1036
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:36,480
interesting talk it's good to be back at

1037
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,819
that slide do you have any evidence that

1038
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:42,839
that works do are people able to set

1039
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,900
boundaries and maintain them once

1040
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,920
they're approached with the right

1041
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,560
trigger points aren't they facing with

1042
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,079
professionals who can try out n

1043
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,000
different trigger points with different

1044
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,099
online fake personalities until it

1045
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:57,980
finally Works

1046
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:00,839
uh yes there is evidence that this works

1047
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,240
because people end up reporting it and

1048
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,859
saying hey I've been receiving these

1049
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:06,300
communications and I feel extremely

1050
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,280
uncertain about it and then

1051
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:11,180
they go and ask their cyber security

1052
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:14,280
department which comes and asks us

1053
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,220
sometimes I also we have evidence that

1054
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,579
it works now of course you can have

1055
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,859
persistent threats that try to find this

1056
00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:26,339
one angle that will work but it comes

1057
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:29,040
down to how

1058
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,819
a perceptive the target is how

1059
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:35,099
knowledgeable they are in terms of

1060
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:36,359
spotting

1061
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,940
it is about risk management in there and

1062
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,480
increasing your defense probabilities

1063
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,300
against cyber threats you hope that they

1064
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,980
will keep recognizing suspicious

1065
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,319
activity when it happens also sometimes

1066
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:51,480
when you have the state doctor trying to

1067
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,260
pry from every young different profile

1068
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,960
these individuals end up realizing that

1069
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,540
okay I must be

1070
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,020
pretty valuable for them and now

1071
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:05,579
I don't want to have to deal with this

1072
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,359
anymore and decide to must block

1073
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,640
everybody for a bit

1074
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,579
so there is also that happening but it

1075
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:17,000
works

1076
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,579
okay one thing it won't work with

1077
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:22,200
everybody because

1078
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,720
people are people but it's about raising

1079
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,259
your probability

1080
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,800
yeah okay thank you very much

1081
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,280
was very interesting and thank you for

1082
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,619
the questions we'll have 10 minutes

1083
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:40,859
break before the next talk so feel free

1084
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:41,819
to

1085
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:45,560
to work around if you want
