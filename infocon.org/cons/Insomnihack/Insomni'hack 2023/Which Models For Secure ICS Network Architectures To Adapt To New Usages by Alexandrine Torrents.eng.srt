1
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:06,779
well good afternoon everyone so today I

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,240
will work about talk about secure ICS

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,400
Network architectures and especially how

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,460
they can be adapted to new usages such

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,220
as cloud iot or machine learning but

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,800
maybe a question to start with how many

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,080
of you have already worked in uh

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,859
industrial control system security

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,500
okay not a lot and how many of you maybe

10
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,098
know about the Purdue model

11
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:34,980
okay not a lot so I'm gonna start with

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,760
um a small introduction about ICS and so

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,579
industrial control system so first where

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,579
do we find industrial Control Systems uh

15
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,059
well pretty much in a lot of different

16
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,680
Industries and sectors such as transport

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,039
Aeronautics nuclear automobile military

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,600
different defense also utilities

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,260
but what is an industrial control system

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,120
so basically it will have an

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,920
interconnection with the physical world

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,920
so you will have sensors and actuators

23
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,439
which represents the actual physical

24
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,500
world and they will be interconnected

25
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,180
with what we call the production Network

26
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,780
and especially PLC which stands for

27
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,780
programmable logic controller so they

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,759
interact with the sensors and actuators

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:26,659
and they send command to open a valve

30
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,939
Turner motor or something like that

31
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,380
then the PLC would be connected to the

32
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,360
supervisions supervision network of the

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,540
scada network so basically here you have

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,520
um like the windows world because you

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,520
have um Windows workstations uh Windows

36
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,979
servers with the supervision application

37
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:49,560
so you have different consoles to

38
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,040
supervise what you have on the plans and

39
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,280
you also find maintenance laptops to go

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,040
and program the plcs on the field for

41
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,119
example

42
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,579
and so this is a combination of these

43
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:04,920
two networks the supervision Network on

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,600
one hand and the production Network and

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,580
the internet on the other end that we

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,679
call the ICS the industrial control

47
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:12,660
system Network

48
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,959
and as you may know the ICS would be

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,540
interconnected most of the time to other

50
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,060
networks and starting with the corporate

51
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,420
network of the company and probably also

52
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:27,180
be connected to the one of the company

53
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,340
and have interconnections with the

54
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,020
Internet or the cloud or external

55
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,879
partners

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,340
so that it's about the introduction and

57
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,440
let's deep dive in in the presentation

58
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,620
so I will tell a story about two very

59
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,220
different secure ICS architecture

60
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,819
but what is a secure architecture

61
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:48,360
um

62
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,739
well

63
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:51,720
um here an introduction about their

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,300
Purdue model so basically it's a

65
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,120
conceptual model where we place the

66
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,519
different components I've just presented

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,920
so different levels basically at level

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,720
zero you have the sensors and the

69
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,440
actuators at level one you will find the

70
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,780
plcs at level two you will you will have

71
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,700
the windows world the supervision

72
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,440
network with your scada servers your

73
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,879
engineering workstations and your

74
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,540
operator consoles at level 3 actually

75
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,659
does not exist at each plant but it's

76
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,900
the kind of orchestrator of your system

77
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,659
you can find that in manufacturing

78
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,040
plants for example when you have

79
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,659
different production lines and you need

80
00:03:33,659 --> 00:03:36,720
to orchestrate different production

81
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,340
Network

82
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,879
then usually depending on the Purdue

83
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,220
model you are using that can be a level

84
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,239
3.5 which is the bmz and then you have

85
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,299
their Enterprise Network at level four

86
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:52,280
so

87
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,959
basically everything that is below level

88
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,940
3 is considered part of the industrial

89
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,400
control system

90
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,459
so this is the Purdue model and this is

91
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:05,519
um uh actually what we call a secure ICS

92
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,819
architecture and actually in 2019 in a

93
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,739
conference dedicated to Industrial

94
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:13,680
control system there was a panel called

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,738
is the Purdue model dead well actually

96
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:18,540
some people thought it was still

97
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,060
accurate today and others thoughts it

98
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,460
was not relevant anymore especially when

99
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,100
considering Cloud so traditionally there

100
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,259
has been a rigidity to what a secure

101
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:30,120
architecture is

102
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,940
and here is an example of free gdt the

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,139
DMZ

104
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,120
so imagine you need an interconnection

105
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,400
with your industrial control system and

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,520
so your OT Network well it's simple you

107
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,639
can put a proxy server in the DMZ and

108
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,699
only allow incoming communication to the

109
00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:48,720
DMZ

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
so it used to work but does it still

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,900
make sense to them well maybe not in all

112
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,120
cases so let's see how we can think

113
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,220
about the future of ICS Network

114
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,520
architecture having a minor specific

115
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,160
motto no limits

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,440
and so let's take an example so I've

117
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,620
been working for various companies that

118
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,919
have a large variety of control systems

119
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,040
uh historical businesses such as power

120
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,820
plants so nuclear chemical or refineries

121
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,120
but also new businesses such as solar

122
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,060
and wind farms and now these various

123
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,820
businesses can be found within the same

124
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,280
company so for this companies the

125
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,160
existing ICS cyber security policy needs

126
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,699
to be adapted to the new usages and

127
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:41,759
businesses but how can we Define cyber

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,740
security requirements and rules that

129
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,440
would apply to the same company so in

130
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,120
this presentation we will compare and

131
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,860
contrast the requirements and

132
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,580
corresponding ICS Network architecture

133
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,979
of two different businesses within the

134
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:57,960
same company

135
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,539
but first an assumption so in this

136
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:01,880
presentation

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,979
I will only discuss about common and

138
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,720
control system because usually when we

139
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,360
talk about ICS we have three different

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,360
kinds of um let's say systems monitoring

141
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,759
systems common and control systems and

142
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,639
Safety Systems so to make my

143
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,699
presentation easier I will only told

144
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,600
here about common and control systems

145
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,759
so let's present in more details our two

146
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,639
use cases so first the historical

147
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:32,880
business the power plants are Refinery

148
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,300
so here we usually have large plants

149
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,520
that are on a single geographical

150
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,880
location with many people working on

151
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,060
sites these systems are designed to

152
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,819
operate locally so on a single physical

153
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:51,479
location and autonomous autonomously

154
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:54,120
there are only a few interconnections

155
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:57,020
and usually they are not Essentials

156
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,360
to the industrial process itself

157
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,120
you have usually a high volume of assets

158
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,919
on the network and they are pretty

159
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:06,960
standard assets like I just presented

160
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,660
before so plcs sensors actuators and the

161
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:12,180
windows workstations and servers and

162
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,039
here the industrial process is usually

163
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,620
complex with many different command and

164
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,080
control requests

165
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,500
then we have our new business the solar

166
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,960
and wind farm so here you we usually

167
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,720
have a lot of very distributed

168
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,240
industrial sites that are communicated

169
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,860
through the internet

170
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,560
so these are really small sites without

171
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,139
any human presence most of the time and

172
00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:40,080
only a few assets on the network mainly

173
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,300
data loggers or inverters

174
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,259
and these systems are usually operated

175
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,860
from the cloud so um concerning command

176
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,520
and control you will only have a few uh

177
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,280
requests and mainly a start and stop

178
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,060
requests remotely and these systems are

179
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,940
also mainly about energy management and

180
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,840
optimization

181
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,819
so would you have the same architecture

182
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,979
and the same cyber security requirements

183
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:14,220
for both cases well probably not

184
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,759
so let's start with the historical

185
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,560
business and secure architecture so here

186
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,479
for the power plant or Refinery we will

187
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:24,660
have standard ICS Network architecture

188
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,580
so following the Purdue model I

189
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,460
presented earlier so we have an

190
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,860
industrial site on a single geographical

191
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,679
location and we have our

192
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,779
OT Network which is a dedicated

193
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,120
OT network with the different assets

194
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,219
I've already presented so the sensors

195
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:44,459
actuators plcs some hmis the scada

196
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:47,100
servers and the different workstations

197
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,440
you can also have segmentation within

198
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,240
the ICS Network and actually it's

199
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,720
recommended but actually not always

200
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,980
implemented on the field

201
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,560
and this OT network will need to have

202
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,899
interconnections with the it Network and

203
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,360
so how do we do that with the DMZ

204
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,279
between the the two networks and we have

205
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,380
two firewalls one between the OT Network

206
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,560
and the IT Network and one and the DMZ

207
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,839
sorry and one between the DMZ and the IT

208
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:13,800
Network

209
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:17,040
and in this DMZ uh what do we have uh

210
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,440
well for example a rebound server for

211
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,320
remote access an update server an

212
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,380
antivirus server and maybe also some

213
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,480
file exchange server or other

214
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,620
application servers hosting um

215
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,720
using used as proxy

216
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,500
then these industrial site is usually

217
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,779
connected to the ones or the wide area

218
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:43,080
network all of the company and connected

219
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,839
to the data center of the company and

220
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,779
it's in this data center we can find

221
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,260
Central Services DMZ and also an

222
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,899
internet DMZ and actually most of the

223
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,440
time it's the main or even the only way

224
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,920
to access the internet so actually the

225
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,240
remote access will go through this

226
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,800
architecture so going through the data

227
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,660
center of the company then go on site

228
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,519
through the DMZ and access the OT

229
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,399
Network

230
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:16,680
so what are the ICS cyber security

231
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,140
requirements for this architecture well

232
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,959
pretty standard DMC between the I.T and

233
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,480
the OT Network protected by firewall so

234
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,040
one firewall between

235
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,620
OT and DMZ and one firewall between DMZ

236
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:31,680
and it we have no direct communication

237
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,920
between the I.T and the OT Networks we

238
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,399
also have protocol break in the DMZ so

239
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,279
we use relay servers for example and

240
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,560
lastly we have no local internet access

241
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,680
on the OT Network so the internet access

242
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,440
goes through the it Network

243
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,200
so would this architecture work work for

244
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,839
the solar and Win Win Farm case

245
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:57,180
so let's try to apply the same

246
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,240
architecture principle for this use case

247
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
so what do we have here we have our main

248
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,839
operator sites with our OT network but

249
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,480
here on this network we on we only have

250
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,120
workstations and the rest of the

251
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,820
industrial process is actually elsewhere

252
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,339
and I will go back on that but then you

253
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:19,079
have actually the same interconnection

254
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,820
with the network data center of the

255
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,620
company and the same remote access

256
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,399
solution but where is the rest of the

257
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,800
industrial Network well if it's

258
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,720
geographically distributed and you have

259
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,260
several industry remote industrial sites

260
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,079
and maybe here a constraint before we go

261
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:37,980
further

262
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,660
um so actually to interconnect Those

263
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,860
Distant sites we wanted to implement

264
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:47,160
mpls pretty standard but we met with

265
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,920
Telecom operators and as I said that the

266
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
mpls was not technically uh possible for

267
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,760
20 percent of the sites so actually here

268
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,200
we had to use

269
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,140
um the internet to interconnect our

270
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,339
sites

271
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,339
so what do we have and remember in this

272
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:07,920
example we have small sites with only a

273
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,200
couple of assets on the network but if

274
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,120
we follow the same Principle as

275
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,360
previously we will have a DMZ

276
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,600
um in to interconnect with the rest of

277
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,000
the network a firewall between the OT

278
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,540
Network and the DMZ another firewall and

279
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,120
internet gateway between the DMZ and the

280
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,300
internet we will have probably VPN IP

281
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,760
sectors connected to the data center of

282
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,620
the company because it's the only way to

283
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,980
reach the main operative sites and since

284
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,500
we cannot allow direct communication we

285
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,700
will have relays in the DMZ

286
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,139
and actually here we miss the scada

287
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,300
server so imagine here the scada servers

288
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,339
are hosted in the cloud so here are

289
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:55,920
similar constraints a DMZ a first

290
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,380
firewall second firewall ipsec Channel

291
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,240
and a relay

292
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,940
well

293
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,100
does this really work let's consider

294
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,260
maybe one of the main Communication in

295
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,860
this architecture obviously and the main

296
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,959
operator site needs to communicate with

297
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
the industrial sites and the cloud with

298
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,040
the scada server needs to communisticate

299
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,380
with the OT Network and they will

300
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,600
probably use a mod boost communication

301
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
modbus I don't know if you know this

302
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,560
protocol but but it's a well-known

303
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,800
industrial protocols but without any

304
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,540
security no authentication no encryption

305
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,459
so this communication will have to go

306
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:38,579
through all the it network of the

307
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:41,220
company and it will have to go through

308
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,660
also some DMZ but can we really have a

309
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,120
DMZ and Implement a protocol breaker

310
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,120
with the modbus communication and do we

311
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,260
really need to use the it Network to

312
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,720
make two industrial sites communicate

313
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,560
with each other maybe not and also in

314
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,200
this now you you may have noticed we

315
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,440
have two different firewalls for each of

316
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
the small sites well maybe if you have

317
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,120
if we have only a couple of sites it

318
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,639
could be visible but imagine you would

319
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,980
need to interconnect 300 small sites

320
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,839
like this well you see it does not scale

321
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,220
so

322
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:26,820
um actually let's try a blank page and

323
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,800
see how we can think about another

324
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,800
architecture that could be uh secure

325
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,300
so

326
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
um what do we have here our

327
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,160
OT Network geographically distributed so

328
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,279
several remote sites without any human

329
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,120
presence the main work site with the

330
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,120
only workstations and the scada servers

331
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,579
hosted in the cloud so remember internet

332
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:53,699
is used as a transport mean to make the

333
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,920
assets communicate with each other

334
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
so one secure architecture solution

335
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,680
would be to virtually create a one

336
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,380
leveraging sd1 technology

337
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,720
so remember our meeting with the Telecom

338
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,600
operators well with them we said that we

339
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,500
could implement sd1 but what is sd1

340
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,560
software defined wide area network so

341
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,079
you will virtually create your one

342
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:23,220
through a network of VPN tunnels mostly

343
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,800
VPN ipsec channels over any physical

344
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,899
networks you so you can have very

345
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,240
different physical networks internets

346
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,579
radio satellites different operators

347
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,220
Network and still build virtually and

348
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,820
logically your wide area network with

349
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,540
this network of VPN IP sectors

350
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,139
so um with that in mind we will have

351
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,339
some sd1 edges at each location so the

352
00:15:50,339 --> 00:15:52,740
the sides the remote sites and also the

353
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,839
cloud which is the infrastructure as a

354
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:55,680
service

355
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,620
so different VPN IP sectors and here so

356
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,500
you can make the main operator sites

357
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,839
talk with the remote sites the cloud

358
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
talk with the remote industrial sites

359
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,959
but the remote sites are not supposed to

360
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,120
talk with each other so there won't be

361
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,540
any direct VPN IP sector not in this

362
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,560
architecture

363
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,079
and then inside the VPN tunnels of

364
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,519
course you can Implement Network

365
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:23,160
filtering and only allow legitimate

366
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,920
communication such as modbus flow I

367
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,260
talked about earlier

368
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,420
and so with this sd1 energies of course

369
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,060
you have the the firewall embedded in

370
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,660
this devices and you can also Implement

371
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,139
detection by activating the IDS

372
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,639
functionality on the firewall for

373
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:42,839
example

374
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:45,300
then what do we have next on this

375
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,480
architecture we have a DMZ uh hosted

376
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,639
probably uh in the cloud and you have

377
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,060
different zones in this DMZ protected by

378
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,160
different firewalls and here it's a DMZ

379
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,339
directly between the OT Network and the

380
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,740
internet so the remote access will go

381
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,160
through this um connection as well and

382
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,740
so if we take a look at the central ttmz

383
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,500
we will see the Central Services where

384
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,740
we can find as previously the Bastion

385
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,859
server update an antivirus server and

386
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,299
actually here for the update for

387
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,179
nonivirus Server they can be connected

388
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,040
directly to the internet to the official

389
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,339
websites of the render probably by

390
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:29,100
implementing a URL whitelisting with

391
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,840
with the proxy

392
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,299
and you could also have here and

393
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,580
consider interconnections with external

394
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,720
partners and so you could add additional

395
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,480
flow analysis and restrictions in the

396
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,419
central DMZ which for example relay of

397
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,900
pro or proxies for standard

398
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,539
Communications and protocols such as

399
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:54,780
https or SFTP and if you need to

400
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,120
interconnect with a partner and use

401
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,980
industrial protocols you can have a

402
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,559
network prod for an industrial protocol

403
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:03,660
analysis

404
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,480
but where is the 80 Network in this

405
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,220
architecture because we still need an

406
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,260
interconnection with the IIT network but

407
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,780
it won't be down on the main operator

408
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:15,299
site here the interconnection will be

409
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,340
directly in the cloud with a dedicated

410
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,200
firewall

411
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,120
um between the DMZ and the IT Network

412
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,919
and you probably will have another

413
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,860
dedicated Network for the it Network

414
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,600
so basically what are the main

415
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,960
differences with this architecture

416
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,080
with the with the previous one sorry we

417
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,960
have the OT Communications between the

418
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,820
site directly and we do not go through

419
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,580
the it Network anymore we have a DMZ

420
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,820
between the OT Network and the internets

421
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,460
directly and we have only one Global DMZ

422
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,780
for the whole

423
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,460
OT Network

424
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,740
so let's sum up the key requirements so

425
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,740
we have our VPN ipseconders between the

426
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,539
industrial sites that are communicating

427
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,660
through the internet so using our sd1

428
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,840
Network we have a global DMZ between the

429
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,660
OT Network and the internet and we do

430
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,640
not need to go through the it Network

431
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,880
anymore we have firewalls with

432
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,400
restricted firewall rules at each

433
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,559
location so the main sides the different

434
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,620
remote sites as well as the cloud and we

435
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,260
have a network probe in the DMZ for flow

436
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,179
analysis especially for industrial

437
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,760
protocols which cannot be used with

438
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,980
their relay or proxies generally

439
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,840
so to sum up for this solar and wind

440
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,760
farm

441
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,419
architecture we have a

442
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:42,360
multi-connectivity using the internet we

443
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,700
are leveraging the sd1 technology to

444
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,740
create a fully distributed industrial

445
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,620
network over the Internet with a large

446
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,799
Cloud strategy and here we adapted the

447
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,539
Purdue model and we placed the

448
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,700
components based on their functionality

449
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,340
and not where they are physically

450
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,860
because I don't know if you noticed

451
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,840
earlier but the internet tends to be

452
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,780
represented as a level 5 in the Purdue

453
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:07,679
model

454
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,559
however be careful because this

455
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,780
architecture is riskier than the

456
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,720
previous one and it will be important to

457
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,120
maintain a good security level but it's

458
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,520
difficult and drifts can be observed

459
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,640
over time especially when you consider

460
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,880
the sd-1 edges you could edges yes you

461
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,860
could have a misconfiguration and have

462
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,200
your site directly Exposed on the

463
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,220
internet

464
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,380
so you will have to you will need

465
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,539
several requirements that needs to be

466
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,559
respected so first end-to-end control of

467
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,299
the communication between the different

468
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:45,120
industrial assets and also you need to

469
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,760
secure your Communications based on the

470
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,100
level and the business need so do you

471
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,980
need the VPN tunnel do you need Network

472
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,740
filtering and how fine-grained filtering

473
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,380
rules within your tunnel do you need

474
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,960
relays do you need the encryption for

475
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,360
the communication do you need to add

476
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,039
detection

477
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,860
but rigor is key in this architecture

478
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:11,400
and the cyber security Basics will need

479
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,919
to be respected finally for industrial

480
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,080
control system

481
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,500
so um to come back to our example so we

482
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,539
needed to have a specific cyber security

483
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,840
requirements for our company and apply

484
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
to all architectures so we've seen that

485
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,820
this architecture can be considered as a

486
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,360
secure one for the solar and wind farm

487
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:35,520
however it might be too risky for our

488
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,620
historical business so the power plants

489
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,659
and earlier we said that the other

490
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,320
architecture was a bit too much for the

491
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,960
solar and wind farm use case so could we

492
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,299
build something around risks to build

493
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,280
our strategy

494
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,799
and so let's try to build a nice yes

495
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,980
classification methodology so here the

496
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:58,200
goal would be to classify an industrial

497
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,400
control system and not especially a site

498
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,679
because you may have different systems

499
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:07,799
on a single site so we will put each

500
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,780
industrial control system on a risk

501
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,059
Matrix and try to differentiate their

502
00:22:12,059 --> 00:22:14,520
criticality so we use a standard

503
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,000
risk-based approach and actually we took

504
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,159
the ANSI which is a French cyber

505
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,400
security agency ICS classification

506
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,220
methodology as a base and we adapted it

507
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,720
to our context so we have the impact and

508
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,179
the likelihood so regarding the impact

509
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,960
here we use the standard HEC impact

510
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,240
scale of the company that is adapted to

511
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,760
all businesses and we have several types

512
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,000
of consequence such as human environment

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,299
image or financial and we will use the

514
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:51,299
global impact the global backstory will

515
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,220
be the maximum of each of the type of

516
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,539
consequence

517
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,120
then we have the likelihood and here we

518
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,360
will have different factors to consider

519
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,000
first the attackers level so are we

520
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,600
talking about non-targeted attacker a

521
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,940
private organization a state-sponsored

522
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,320
organization

523
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,600
we will also consider the functionality

524
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,940
so are we talking about monitoring

525
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,460
system a common and control system a

526
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,900
safety system

527
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,059
we will also consider the connectivity

528
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:23,400
so are we on a single geographical

529
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,500
location are we using

530
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,299
um distributed network using a private

531
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:33,120
Network such as mpls so are we using a

532
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,340
public networks

533
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,260
and we will also consider the level of

534
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,020
access control so the level of

535
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,580
identification and Authentication

536
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,740
so for each of this Factor we will get a

537
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,020
number and then we have a formula to

538
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,500
calculate the likelihood and then we

539
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,720
will have our risk metrics and we will

540
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,440
place the industrial control system on

541
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,960
The Matrix and it will give us the

542
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,299
classification and in our example we

543
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:04,440
have four classes of classification

544
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,799
and it's important when you build such

545
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,919
methodology to consider also regulations

546
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:12,419
to have maybe some minimum

547
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,140
classification depending on your systems

548
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,360
so let's try the classification on our

549
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,580
two system examples

550
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,880
so first the impacts for for the power

551
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,760
plant and the refinery here and we have

552
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:31,080
for example a civil site with ihec risks

553
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,720
so we have eye impact so let's say three

554
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,659
and for the solar and when some here we

555
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:39,600
have no HTC risks and actually not a lot

556
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,880
of risks the highest impact would be a

557
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,340
financial loss due to a production stop

558
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,679
for example so maybe here the impact

559
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:48,299
will be only two

560
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,820
then we're getting the likelihood so to

561
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,799
ease the case we will consider we have

562
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,720
the same attacker levels the same access

563
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,240
level and the same functionalities with

564
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,860
the connectivity which will make the

565
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,760
difference

566
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,220
and so regarding the connectivity on the

567
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,960
power plant and Refinery we have a low

568
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,640
connectivity because we have an

569
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,080
industrial Network and a single

570
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,419
geographical location and only a few

571
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:11,760
interconnections with the 80 Network so

572
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,200
with the formula we will get a

573
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,840
likelihood of two and for the solar and

574
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,820
wind farm as you saw and we have a high

575
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,440
connectivity because we have a

576
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,780
geographically distributed industrial

577
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,260
control system and we are using a public

578
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,260
network so with the formula we will get

579
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,659
a like load of three

580
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:33,659
so with that we can place our industrial

581
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,520
control system on The Matrix and we get

582
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,159
a class 3 system for the power plant and

583
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,380
the refinery and the class 2 system for

584
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,419
the solar and wind farm so you see when

585
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:44,220
that we end up with two different

586
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,700
classifications for our systems and so

587
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,880
we may consider different requirements

588
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,360
depending on the class of the system so

589
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,520
for example for a class 3 system we

590
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,659
could forbid the use of cloud we could

591
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:03,900
have only a private Network used and for

592
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,240
Class 2 Network we could allow uh and

593
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,760
under certain circumstances and Cloud

594
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,120
Communications sd1 technology with a

595
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,520
strong VPN and network filtering with

596
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,779
detection

597
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:17,900
Etc

598
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,080
but can it be then simple unfortunately

599
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,779
no but let's take a step back on our

600
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:27,600
example what was the main decision

601
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,480
factor for the secure architecture it

602
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,000
was connectivity and impacts because for

603
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,980
the power plant and the refinery we had

604
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,039
an IHC risk so interconnections were

605
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:41,220
limited no Cloud no distributed Network

606
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,980
and no public network and for the solar

607
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,200
and wind farm we had low risk and high

608
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,140
distributed network but is there any

609
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,700
additional factors that could be

610
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,340
considered to help with the

611
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,400
classification and our requirements well

612
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,799
we could consider for example multiple

613
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,919
expositions because in my example I only

614
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,679
talked about the the cloud but we could

615
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,559
also um

616
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,880
consider interconnections with

617
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,740
applications from the corporate Network

618
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:13,200
and the systems needs to be considered

619
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,679
as a whole and for example since we are

620
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:18,539
talking about the same company you've

621
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,299
seen that in the two scenarios we have a

622
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:25,740
global Central Services DMZ well could

623
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,620
could we mutualize this DMZ for the

624
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,100
whole company or is maybe the risk of

625
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,779
compromising the power plant Refinery

626
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:39,539
through the solar and wind farm Maybe 2i

627
00:27:39,539 --> 00:27:42,020
and we can also consider regulations

628
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,840
physical access device access control

629
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,080
and data confidentiality as well

630
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,500
but in the end a big pragmatic and do

631
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,240
not stick to a formula you should

632
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,520
consider key factors and make your

633
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,580
classification accordingly

634
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:02,460
and also another interesting thing would

635
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,860
be to Build architecture patterns so for

636
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,799
your company you could identify the full

637
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,840
use cases

638
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,539
um build a reference architecture based

639
00:28:12,539 --> 00:28:16,460
on the risk analysis and this

640
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,039
architectures patterns we need to um be

641
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,620
regularly updated because business needs

642
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,779
and Technical capabilities evolve

643
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,159
regularly

644
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,380
so you could have some Global cyber

645
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,200
security requirements to respect

646
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,080
depending on your ICS classification but

647
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,299
then have a different architecture

648
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,880
patterns for each of your new use cases

649
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,659
with some specific requirements

650
00:28:42,659 --> 00:28:45,480
and so let's go further on that and with

651
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,580
their architecture patterns and let's

652
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:50,279
build a naughty use case catalog for the

653
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:53,039
company we saw the adapted cyber

654
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,220
security Frameworks

655
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,740
so why do we need the catalog first so

656
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,720
I've already talked about it a bit but

657
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,539
let's deep dive here so with this use

658
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,340
case catalog it would be more concrete

659
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,919
than a cyber a simple cyber security

660
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,919
policy so I'm not saying it will replace

661
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,840
anti-alization in the Cyber CPT policy

662
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,820
but actually it will be concrete and

663
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,700
answers business operational questions

664
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,159
and provide operational guidelines

665
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:26,220
directly to the industrial sites and

666
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,020
it's also important to provide

667
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,659
ready-to-use tools to local teams

668
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:33,000
because usually they have limited times

669
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,120
time sorry resources and also a few

670
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,779
cyber security skills and it will allow

671
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,520
you also to have consistent

672
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,880
architectures and cyber Security

673
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,799
Solutions across your company so it will

674
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,679
avoid local initiatives and maybe build

675
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,779
a non-secure architectures

676
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:56,760
so we will you will need to list first

677
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,580
the different use cases for your company

678
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,399
and build a deep dive for each of the

679
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:04,919
use case and so you could have three

680
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,580
different parts for each of the use case

681
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,460
first a description of the use case then

682
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,919
a network architecture diagram and

683
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,740
finally some technical guidelines to

684
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,059
respects

685
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:22,020
so let's take a few examples so four

686
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:25,080
here in my presentation so first let's

687
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,440
consider remote control of industrial

688
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,659
applications so a bit like my previous

689
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:33,480
example let's imagine a geographically

690
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,820
distributed industrial control system

691
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,919
with different sites communicating

692
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,880
through the internet with a central

693
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,260
supervisor insights

694
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,480
a second use case here where you can

695
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,380
have iot sensors on your industrial

696
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,980
Network connected to an application in

697
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,899
the cloud for monitoring and predictive

698
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:00,419
maintenance for example

699
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,399
a search case when you could have a

700
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,559
remote maintenance operations so an

701
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,779
external partner responsible for the

702
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,640
maintenance and operations of your sites

703
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,360
having to connect remotely to your

704
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,159
industrial site to perform some

705
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,919
Administration actions

706
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,820
and a first example here with maybe a

707
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,760
more machine learning with a Cloud

708
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,159
solution for energy optimization for

709
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,740
example and so this application is

710
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,440
hosted on the cloud and is directly

711
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,059
connected to your industrial control

712
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,480
system but here not only for monitoring

713
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,720
um well first information gathered from

714
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,580
the industrial sites but with the

715
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,620
application from the planet analyzes the

716
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,740
data and is also capable to send command

717
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,500
and control requests to your industrial

718
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,720
control system

719
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,539
so today we will focus on the first one

720
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,700
and the fourth one and I will present

721
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,159
you what it could look like in the use

722
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,799
case catalog so first example for the

723
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,360
remote control of industrial

724
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,820
installations so a brief description so

725
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,700
um we have geographically distributed

726
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,559
industrial sites and we have common and

727
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,740
control which is managed from a central

728
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,380
OT site so here we can consider that

729
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,620
it's a an extended OT Network

730
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,320
and a few technical characteristics so

731
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,080
here's the site communicates through the

732
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,240
internet and we have ot to OT

733
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,480
communication so mostly Industrial

734
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,279
Communications I mentioned earlier

735
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,340
modbus but we could find also a OPC UA

736
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,440
or any other industrial protocols

737
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:44,039
between the central sites and the plcs

738
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,899
on the remote sites and we have no local

739
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,000
IIT Network on the remote sites it's

740
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,500
just a small network with only

741
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,539
industrial assets

742
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,640
so then we could have our Network

743
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,580
diagrams so we are a bit like my sd1

744
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,600
example

745
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,940
um as previously but a bit smaller with

746
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,179
just a Central site with their assets

747
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:08,340
and only a couple of sites but we still

748
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,380
have a DMZ and a VPN ipsec tunnels and

749
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,140
so then we could have some technical

750
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,260
guidelines like this so I won't read

751
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:22,860
everything but you get an example so we

752
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,860
um we need a DMZ between Dot and the

753
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:27,960
internet we will Implement a network

754
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,899
filtering over the different tunnels and

755
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,799
only authorize a white list of data we

756
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,460
will have also IDs sensors and give some

757
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,080
specific guidelines about the the

758
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,880
filtering that we are allowing between

759
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,039
the sites

760
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:49,340
then second example so with the energy

761
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,919
optimization solution so here um again

762
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:55,679
it's a Cloud solution using machine

763
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,559
learning to automatically send a command

764
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,840
and control requests to the scada server

765
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,679
and in terms of technical characteristic

766
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,919
characteristics sorry so we have the

767
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:08,899
application

768
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,540
hosted on a partner Cloud it's not the

769
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,580
company who has this application it's an

770
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,800
external partner

771
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,540
um with this solution we need to install

772
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:23,399
somewhere in the company Network device

773
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:26,399
um that will be directly communicated uh

774
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,320
to uh the OT Network and actually

775
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,139
communicate directly um with the plcs

776
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:34,260
using for example modbus protocol and

777
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,060
this partner device will also be

778
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,239
connected to the partner Cloud using a

779
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,379
standard https communication

780
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,739
so again a network diagram with the

781
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:48,960
device so here you see that we decided

782
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,580
in this example to have the partner

783
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,239
device in the DMZ between the partner

784
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:57,300
cloud and the OT Network we have an

785
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,000
https proxy and some firewalls in the

786
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,080
architecture

787
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,940
but then if we want to have the

788
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,740
technical guidelines we can have

789
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,160
specific slides and requirements so here

790
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,280
we specify that the personal device

791
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,560
needs to be installed in a DMZ between

792
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,859
the industrial Network and the internet

793
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:18,780
it states that we need a protocol break

794
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,780
in the DMZ and we need to filter the

795
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,300
different Communications using a

796
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,420
firewall so here we have https with the

797
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,060
cloud and modbus with industrial site so

798
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,920
we consider that we have the protocol

799
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,079
break with this partner device

800
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,440
then here since we are talking about

801
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,359
command and control it's pretty

802
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,240
dangerous you might think to allow an

803
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,040
application hosted in the cloud and

804
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,900
especially an external partner

805
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,060
application to send command and control

806
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:50,820
requests uh to your industrial control

807
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:53,300
system and actually directly to the PLC

808
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,240
so here you could have additional

809
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,400
requirements uh to um well make sure

810
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,640
that you cannot do anything to harmful

811
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,859
to the industrial control system and

812
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,920
maybe here Implement filtering at the

813
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,380
application Level

814
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:13,140
with your um by putting a dedicated

815
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,240
firewall after your partner device

816
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,280
before the communication with the OT

817
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,980
sites and so if we take modbus as an

818
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,560
example we could add the application

819
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,400
Level make sure that for example no PLC

820
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,119
programmation would be possible by

821
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,160
blocking communication with the specific

822
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,619
Administration function

823
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:38,579
we could allow uh read requests on the

824
00:36:38,579 --> 00:36:42,980
all PLC address range and regarding the

825
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,500
right request we could

826
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,720
um authorize only some specific

827
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,560
addresses of the PLC to be written and

828
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,720
also have some specific

829
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,520
information about the data that can be

830
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:03,420
written and have some some specific

831
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,599
thresholds for the data to be written

832
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,940
and then it's pretty pretty basic

833
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,440
encrypting communication with the

834
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,260
internet and maybe again some detection

835
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,200
mechanisms

836
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,839
so that was for the example but what are

837
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,760
the key success factors for such a

838
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,760
catalog well three steps uh in my

839
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,980
opinion first the fact that it's really

840
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,380
important to co-construct the catalog

841
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,440
with with the business it's also very

842
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,960
important to communicate the catalog and

843
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,619
promotes it at all levels within the the

844
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,599
company and make sure that people on

845
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,240
sites know about this catalog and of

846
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,339
course keep this catalog updated

847
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,160
regularly and add new use case if you

848
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,859
have new use cases

849
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:53,640
another important thing about such a

850
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,220
catalog it's really important to have

851
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,160
Technical Solutions to be provided it's

852
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,300
good to have a catalog but we need to

853
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,940
go from Theory to practice and actually

854
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,099
provide Technical Solutions to

855
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,900
Industrial sites because like I said

856
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,300
previously they do not have uh always

857
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:15,380
the the resources and the skills

858
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,880
and these Technical Solutions needs to

859
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,980
be anticipated so when you build such

860
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,560
catalog it's important that you have all

861
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,500
stakeholders involved and especially the

862
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,440
Architects to make sure that it's

863
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,220
feasible to implement such Solutions

864
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,300
otherwise you will probably have to

865
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,760
start everything from scratch

866
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,119
then um how could we manage the

867
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,760
different architecture patterns in our

868
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,480
company and especially which Central

869
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,579
infrastructures because many companies

870
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,859
have chosen to centralize their

871
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,900
resources and especially their OT

872
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,200
Solutions and so have a centralized

873
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,500
OT DMZ it can be a different level the

874
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,619
entire company or sometimes it's a

875
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:05,700
regional DMZ so what do we have here in

876
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:08,880
such Central infrastructures

877
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,940
um like you've seen in their previous

878
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,859
Network diagrams we can have antivirus

879
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:16,380
update servers remote access solution

880
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,599
maybe an active directory as well to

881
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:22,260
manage identities proxies Etc and the

882
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,660
benefits of such centralization is a

883
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,339
better knowledge and control of the

884
00:39:26,339 --> 00:39:28,820
industrial assets and also the

885
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:31,740
uniformity of the designs and solutions

886
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,859
across the company

887
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,859
but then maybe a question about uh

888
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:39,960
mutualization because when we talk about

889
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,780
uh centralization it implies asking the

890
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,420
questions of the mutualization of the

891
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,940
infrastructure infrastructure sorry so

892
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:50,040
going back to what I said uh earlier

893
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,619
with our two uh examples so I've

894
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:55,920
mentioned uh two different options one

895
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,380
option where the company would decide to

896
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,740
have only uh one Global uh info Central

897
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:03,300
infrastructures for the whole company

898
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,839
and option b with two different zones

899
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:10,260
depending on the site criticality

900
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,500
well here we go back to our risk-based

901
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,440
approach because here you need maybe to

902
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,660
build a decision tree for your company

903
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,820
based on the different industrial sites

904
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,859
and businesses you may have so how many

905
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:25,500
different zones you would need and how

906
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,160
you would classify the different sites

907
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,520
and decide which zone will be used for

908
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,960
which industrial control system

909
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,000
so final takeaways for the presentation

910
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,060
so we've seen that control systems can

911
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,920
be very different and just security

912
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,619
rules and architectures can be different

913
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:49,320
so the historical ICS secure

914
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,960
architecture is not uh specifically

915
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,960
applicable to new usages and the Purdue

916
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,800
model needs to be adapted and so here

917
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,020
are some key factors to have in mind for

918
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,880
an architecture decision

919
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,520
first what does the control system do

920
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,760
and what are the business needs then

921
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,740
what would be the impact and especially

922
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,920
in terms of HCC if there was any attack

923
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,940
on this system and maybe a third key

924
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,740
factor which is my level of exposition

925
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,839
so in terms of Transport means for

926
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,200
example but also in terms of

927
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,839
applications and other systems connected

928
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,640
to this application

929
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,859
so it would be really important to

930
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,800
document your use case for your company

931
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,260
because it will help your classification

932
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,859
and architecture decisions and so um I

933
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:42,300
think it's good for companies to

934
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,400
consider launching a task force to

935
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,920
support a project and Industrial sites

936
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,320
and build secure architectures for new

937
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,599
usages because they will happen whether

938
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,460
you're here or not

939
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,859
and maybe a final thought

940
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,200
um how can we find the right balance

941
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,240
because having different secure

942
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,359
architectures for each of your use cases

943
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:06,119
within the company is good but only up

944
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:08,160
to a certain level of manageability

945
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,380
because you will have to maintain all

946
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,839
these architectures and solution so

947
00:42:12,839 --> 00:42:15,000
unfortunately you cannot have as many

948
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,540
architectures as control systems thank

949
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,660
you

950
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,599
thank you

951
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,339
do we have any questions

952
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,099
hello hey

953
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:40,079
um thank you for the presentation it was

954
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:42,060
very interesting I really liked it I

955
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,079
have two concerns about your model

956
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:51,680
um with one Central DMZ

957
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,020
um imagine a company that has multiple

958
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,680
sites all over the world Like Us South

959
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,819
America China Europe you name it

960
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,140
um

961
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,720
have you considered if having uh one

962
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,720
Central DMZ doesn't mean a lot of

963
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:11,339
latency

964
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:15,000
with in communication with that wouldn't

965
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,480
a model with I don't know one DMZ per

966
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,220
continent

967
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,119
um be a better idea in here yeah

968
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:25,140
um

969
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,460
plus I see one advantage of uh

970
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,060
traditional Purdue model over your model

971
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:34,020
um

972
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,940
because if you have sites all over the

973
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,180
world and you have one DMZ per site

974
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,140
than if there is a connection breakdown

975
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:44,460
then there is a chance the site can

976
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,880
still operate in your model it can't

977
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:50,780
actually in my present

978
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,819
a very different

979
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:55,619
answers depending on the industry for

980
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,660
example because here I mentioned the

981
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:00,500
solar and wind found that we have also

982
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:03,680
other kind of distributed

983
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,560
ICS in utilities for example and maybe

984
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,599
it's not the same risk and so you won't

985
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,060
allow what I've just presented there for

986
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,520
other kind of industry and maybe to

987
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:17,040
answer your first question as well

988
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,900
um so yes of course it depends on the

989
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,660
company to have either one big Central

990
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,359
DMZ or several spread across different

991
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,339
continents but also what's important

992
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:28,520
here to have in mind is that

993
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:31,440
usually what you have in the DMZ is not

994
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,619
essential to the production so so it's

995
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:38,520
not uh it's it's if you lose the DMZ

996
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,960
it's not supposed to block your

997
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,960
production and so that's why also in my

998
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,579
um

999
00:44:43,579 --> 00:44:47,160
design with the solar and wind form case

1000
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:51,000
uh I was um I really wanted to have the

1001
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,460
OT sites directly in communication with

1002
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,099
each other without going through a big

1003
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,960
architecture so if sites need to

1004
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,220
communicate with each other they will

1005
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,380
have a direct

1006
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,880
tunnel between the two

1007
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,660
to avoid what you just said

1008
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:07,619
yeah

1009
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:09,839
I have a question um I'm more on the

1010
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,220
left hand side oil and gas companies

1011
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,079
which I'm not working for in cars but my

1012
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:15,180
organization has lots of control systems

1013
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,060
and I see more more demands that even

1014
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,319
your engineering stations your

1015
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:22,040
operational stations uh

1016
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,780
provisioned like with standard I.T we

1017
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,400
see that we're running control system in

1018
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,200
Docker containers we see that we're

1019
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,579
running virtual machines for Control

1020
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:32,579
Systems we see that we program plcs from

1021
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,400
git repositories and so on so um we're

1022
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,140
using machine learning for predictive

1023
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,180
maintenance on so how does this fit into

1024
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,859
your model it does not fit in the Purdue

1025
00:45:40,859 --> 00:45:42,900
model because it's normal or less

1026
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,060
bridging all layers how does it fit in

1027
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:48,300
yours yeah it can fit as well and for

1028
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:52,140
example if you take a soft PL fees where

1029
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,300
you do not have the hardware device

1030
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:57,540
anymore but it's uh virtualized using

1031
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:59,880
Code assist for example it will still be

1032
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,400
put in my model at the level one of the

1033
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,140
Purdue model it will just have a

1034
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,119
different device

1035
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:08,099
so you need to adapt the purview model

1036
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:11,520
with the new solutions that exist on the

1037
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,099
markets but in the end does the same

1038
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,660
thing your protective means don't work

1039
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:17,280
anymore if I'm talking about Docker

1040
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,800
containers nobody in my organization

1041
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,540
will rewrite the docker container from

1042
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,760
scratch they will come from outside so

1043
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,040
um they download it from Docker maybe or

1044
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:28,680
the the the the the virtual machines

1045
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:31,140
come from outside so um yeah how does

1046
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,780
that fit in yeah so actually here if you

1047
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:37,079
are using it Solutions you can also use

1048
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,319
a I.T cyber security good practices also

1049
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,359
for OT

1050
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:44,460
you should do the same thing

1051
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,920
because people tend to think that OT

1052
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:49,680
cyber security is really different from

1053
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,500
I.T security but not that much in my

1054
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,859
opinion uh however you can have very

1055
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:58,319
automation uh solution to prevent an

1056
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,900
attack for example having controls

1057
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,960
directly directly on on PLC and make

1058
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,420
sure that even if someone is in the

1059
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:09,420
network you cannot directly reprogram

1060
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,940
the the PLC and having a good practices

1061
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,720
developing the the PLC but for the rest

1062
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,520
uh I mean

1063
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,160
um most of the protocols are still an

1064
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,500
encrypted and unauthenticated so one of

1065
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,660
the best way to protect industrial

1066
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,180
control system is by the network but if

1067
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,180
you change all the devices and use more

1068
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,339
I.T systems maybe you will get rid of

1069
00:47:32,339 --> 00:47:34,800
the old industrial protocols that are

1070
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,900
unsecure by Design and you won't have

1071
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,040
these issues anymore

1072
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,180
I'm not offering other questions because

1073
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:47,099
we don't have much time left so thank

1074
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,360
you very much alexandrina

1075
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,499
[Applause]
