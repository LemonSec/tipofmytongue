1
00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:08,700
thank you very much ale

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,400
it's nice to be back actually welcome

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,920
Luzon

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,379
good I'm going to talk about crazy

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,240
incentives and how they drive secure

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,279
into No Man's Land what do you mean by

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,080
that I mean incentives are very often

8
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,460
misaligned with security

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,019
so we start working away we struggle we

10
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:33,660
invest time and resources and instead of

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,300
going forward we're going backwards or

12
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,899
in the wrong direction so despite hard

13
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,420
work we're not getting Security in

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,200
return

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,660
and I'm going to start to think about

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,120
this concept I realized very often it's

17
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,340
incentives the drive is in the wrong

18
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,239
direction we're not aware of the

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:55,860
incentives of people working with us

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,620
we're not aware of the incentives of

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,260
vendors selling us their products we're

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,260
not even aware of our own incentives

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,020
so what I'm going to do

24
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:10,320
is walking you through a couple of

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,820
examples

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,780
uh let's Dive Right In

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,840
this is from a video stream from Naomi

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,420
Wu a real sexy Cyborg on Twitter I think

29
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,060
she walked around in Gansu or Shanghai

30
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,880
in January or February and posted the

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,460
video and people went crazy immediately

32
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,020
because what is happening here what do

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,259
you see you see mostly young women

34
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,479
flocking to an undercrossing to to

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:37,799
streaming

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,780
at first this looks like a sweatshop

37
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,420
however they're all volunteers they want

38
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,060
to do this they want to be there they

39
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,680
want to stream there why is that it's

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,420
not the beauty of the scenery it's also

41
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,520
not the good company what is happening

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,000
is they have incentives to game the

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,740
location feature of the streaming

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,799
software they want to stream from a

45
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,180
certain location from a good

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,700
neighborhood instead of being outside

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,340
town where nobody would follow them they

48
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,038
were on a stream from exactly this

49
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,879
position that's why in the night in the

50
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,099
evening they flock together in an under

51
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:17,099
Crossing so they have an incentive to

52
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,560
game the location feature and the result

53
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,780
is European being puzzle going crazy

54
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,480
over the video but this exploded so

55
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,239
quickly so what we see here is

56
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,879
incentives at play that are very funny

57
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:32,780
results

58
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,099
um as Alice said I'm Christina Fellini

59
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,379
I'm a Swiss security engineer I have a

60
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,480
background in medieval history so this

61
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,060
is what I did uh before I turn to

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,739
security this is where I get my helmets

63
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,319
from I'm a co-leader of the Ovis mod

64
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,180
security Coral set a web application

65
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,099
viral project I'm going to talk about

66
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,340
that as well I happen to be the program

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,400
chair of the partnering conference Swiss

68
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,920
cyber storm happening in October you see

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,500
you have great company conference at the

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,760
end of the winter and you have another

71
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,920
great conference in Bern in October

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,680
please join us in burn on October for

73
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,019
Swiss cyberstorm apparently I'm aware of

74
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:11,940
many helmets and also working in

75
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,700
e-voting security talk about that at a

76
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,640
previous

77
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,260
keynote and now I'm going to talk about

78
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,720
incentives I'm taking this off because

79
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,640
it's a bit heavy in the end

80
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,500
so incentives

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,599
first what is an incentive I turn to

82
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:32,400
Wikipedia what else would I do and

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,620
Wikipedia tells me in general incentives

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,220
are anything that a persuade a person to

85
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,959
alter their behavior I guess we can

86
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,019
agree on that if we continue with the

87
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:45,959
definition a bit we get to higher

88
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,959
incentives amount to Greater levels of

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,440
effort and therefore higher levels of

90
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,879
performance

91
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,099
streaming in the under Crossing you get

92
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,200
this you make an effort to drive there

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,379
maybe to freeze in the winter for higher

94
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,540
levels of performance that's the view

95
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,440
count

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,280
uh performance already points to

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,260
economics

98
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,659
incentives is an economic term it's

99
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,459
definitely not a cyber security term

100
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,680
this is not a term that our industry

101
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,100
coined incentives is an economic it's a

102
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,358
business term

103
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,080
and this already shows you we have

104
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,419
different incentives here we have

105
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,120
economic incentives and we want to have

106
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,639
security and send this into two are

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,259
absolutely not aligned with one another

108
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,960
obviously if they're misaligned

109
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,900
higher performance means better sales

110
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,100
for a company selling you the snake oil

111
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:50,280
or stupid tasks that we execute and the

112
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,460
result in higher level of friction more

113
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,759
work for us but not security as a

114
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,820
follower as a result ultimately we just

115
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:02,460
heat the climate by running more jobs in

116
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,240
our computer without much results in

117
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,180
terms of security think antivirus

118
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,460
running on a Windows desktop and I'm not

119
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,199
even saying that this is not necessary

120
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,419
I'm just saying it's a lot of investment

121
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:19,139
of electricity and CPU cycles for

122
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:21,180
relatively little gain

123
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:26,759
keep things up optimal incentives mean

124
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,180
that we get a maximum of security for a

125
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,400
minimal investment of resources I mean

126
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,860
this is what we actually would like to

127
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,580
get ideally we don't have friction that

128
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,100
means we have the incentives

129
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,080
pointing over there

130
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,020
and we follow these incentives and we

131
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,320
get the same amount of security that we

132
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,860
expected so if you follow bad incentives

133
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:56,100
that lead you in a different direction

134
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,800
and you're a security engineer working

135
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,960
in a blue team so in defense

136
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,419
set up then you're not doing your job

137
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:06,240
properly maybe without even being aware

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,340
you just follow incentives you're not

139
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,199
aware that the incentives actually

140
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,259
leading you away from security and if

141
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,900
you implement the wrong incentives that

142
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,580
fail to support the security of your

143
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,780
users

144
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,419
then shame on you because you're placing

145
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,740
incentives so people are getting

146
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,720
bad security instead of what you're

147
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,120
supposed to give them as a defense

148
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,840
engineer then shame on you uh

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,259
Twitter announced a month ago that they

150
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,780
would stop doing text message to factor

151
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,419
authentication for non-paying users

152
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,639
so whoever tried

153
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,419
um

154
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,759
to convince their mother-in-law like I

155
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,180
did or some somebody else to enable

156
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,520
two-factor application will realize the

157
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,560
text message two-factor applications a

158
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,720
weak form of two-factor authentication

159
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,400
but at least it is a little bit of

160
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,479
security

161
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,060
so they have a relatively small often

162
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,340
people are relatively small security

163
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,280
interest small incentive for security

164
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,080
but text message you can kind of

165
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,660
convince them if you make an effort and

166
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,940
they get a bit of security out of this

167
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,699
and Twitter or Elon scrambling for money

168
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,680
is now stopping that but Elon is

169
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,259
actually doing he's doing a b testing on

170
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,800
the strength of the security desire of

171
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,880
his

172
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,360
users he TR he presents them with a

173
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,960
joist if he wants security you pay me

174
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,180
and if you want to save money

175
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,599
then you lose security or your upgrade

176
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,280
to the Google Authenticator or other

177
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,259
authenticator apps and that is simply

178
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:45,360
too complicated for a lot of people and

179
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,919
I didn't manage to explain this to my

180
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,740
mother-in-law so

181
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,180
Elon absolutely made a choice by placing

182
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,319
incentives a front of his users asking

183
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,220
them to choose security or money

184
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,680
this was enacted this week so we don't

185
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,900
have the number actually I'm also not

186
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,539
sure we're getting to get the numbers

187
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,960
and however it's perfectly clear

188
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,419
that if we want to save money you're

189
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,360
going to drop security

190
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,400
and if you want a security that means

191
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,440
more money for Twitter but I think it's

192
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
more likely we're getting less security

193
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,740
for users shame on you Elon shame on you

194
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,899
some of the examples I'm going to to

195
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:36,240
present here will not be quite obvious

196
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,059
and I think that is a problem with the

197
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,679
Elon Musk and Twitter example is very

198
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,020
obvious where the incentives are here

199
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,120
it's not so clear

200
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,820
and I have rounded up a couple of

201
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:50,040
examples where we really need to think

202
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,019
very hard where are the incentives

203
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,240
actually how are we driven by them how

204
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
are users driven by these examples this

205
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,980
is a necessary Port I have a bit of a

206
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,660
knack for NASA's report it's not a good

207
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,060
one it's small print don't try to read

208
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,500
this but it says critical security

209
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,680
vulnerable is 44. substantial high

210
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,620
security vulnerabilities 309.

211
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,680
for 309 high security vulnerabilities

212
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,779
I think that is a strong impact I mean

213
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:17,700
if you read a report like that that's a

214
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,839
strong message

215
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,180
and the incentive that you're feeling or

216
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,180
I'm feeling is let's jump to action this

217
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,940
is actionable every critical security

218
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,880
vulnerability here is is meant to be

219
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,920
fixed isn't it maybe you want to patch

220
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,959
this you want to get secure you want to

221
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,140
invest a lot of time and resources

222
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:39,060
namely if audit is around the corner

223
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,560
this happened to a friend of mine that's

224
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,540
how I return on Twitter unless this

225
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,180
reports last week he was handed 229

226
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,920
NASA's report by a customer customer

227
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,540
didn't care about secured for several

228
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,779
years now audit was coming back and here

229
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,360
as a security consultant received the

230
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,060
220 pages and that's this report please

231
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,000
fix this for us you have four weeks

232
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,580
uh

233
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,080
now

234
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,959
if you jump to action and start on page

235
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,820
number one or after the executive

236
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,980
summary in page number two you're doing

237
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,399
a bad job here unfortunately uh second

238
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,980
screenshot is actually from from the

239
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,240
report my friend received uh NASA's

240
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,060
proposes to ensure that the proxy

241
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,640
modules are disabled on a given server

242
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,920
the problem is that server was a proxy

243
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,560
server

244
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,500
so NASA's effectively

245
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,140
tried to convince my friend please

246
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,420
disable the central functionality of

247
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,360
that server so you're secure I mean this

248
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,279
is a classic false positive this is

249
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:47,880
stupid advice nasus has been around for

250
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,800
more or less 20 years

251
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,019
proxy technology on web server has been

252
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,420
around for 25 years at least

253
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,240
and nessus is still not in a position to

254
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,920
find out whether a server is a proxy

255
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,779
server or not Italian work on proxy

256
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:03,240
survey it's a one-liner it's so easy if

257
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,279
it has a backhand configure chances are

258
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,019
it's a proxy server

259
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:08,880
and Nest is not able to do it was nice

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,620
of an as it tells you how it found out

261
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,839
the proxy modules are enabled this is

262
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:14,880
the second slide here there is the

263
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,920
command if you look at the command it

264
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,260
looks really sophisticated while awk and

265
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,360
stuff wow crap that's really nice it's

266
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,220
the wrong config file

267
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,680
nessus takes the default conflict file

268
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,360
chances are the server is running a

269
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,220
different complicated this is too stupid

270
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,620
to identify the real config file people

271
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,000
pay money for this I'm surprised

272
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,800
what are the incentives here

273
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,560
the incentives tell you work through the

274
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,100
spreadsheet check off the findings and

275
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,620
you gain insecurity this is what NASA's

276
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,899
promises to you but this route is

277
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,980
actually time wasted fighting symptoms

278
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,360
instead of fixing the core problem what

279
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,920
is the core problem here we have

280
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,740
hundreds of security vulnerabilities we

281
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:01,920
have bad policies and bad processes

282
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,500
processes that's the core problem here

283
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,380
and the individual high security finding

284
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,060
the server that is not patched is only a

285
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,820
symptom of that so you can run after all

286
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,260
these symptoms try to fix them but

287
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,420
you're not adding anything because two

288
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,399
weeks afterwards you'll have new

289
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,860
security vulnerabilities the processes

290
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,260
are completely wrong and nasus is

291
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,660
contributing to the problem nasus is not

292
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,519
providing you with the solution and I'm

293
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:28,500
not saying there is no job for nesses in

294
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,540
this game I think if you have a perfect

295
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:33,899
setup and everything is fine the nurses

296
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,200
can come in and reassure you yes good

297
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,380
job tap on the shoulder nicely done the

298
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,120
problem is of course if NASA tested to

299
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,680
disable the proxy server then it's no

300
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,500
good so too many false positive and too

301
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,079
much friction working through false

302
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,480
positive not good

303
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,519
next

304
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,899
idea or example

305
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,500
this is a random headline I found on the

306
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,279
internet

307
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:05,820
and it says that overfill 40 million

308
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,339
cyber attacks are blocked daily says a

309
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,079
report if you read the small print

310
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,320
actually says 14 million attacks on 1200

311
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,220
websites amongst two 12 billion requests

312
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,560
on a single day by a super strong

313
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,980
sensors by some random security company

314
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,839
these are not attacks ladies and

315
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:27,839
gentlemen these are bullets

316
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,639
what is an attack and what is a bullet

317
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:31,320
we have an industry that is not quite

318
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,360
sure what an attack actually means but

319
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,519
that is an individual HTTP request here

320
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,980
so 40 million

321
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,100
requests very intercepted but that's not

322
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,720
an attack it's like going to war and

323
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,600
Counting bullets there's no point that

324
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,880
is irrelevant information they make a

325
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,100
headline out of this because they profit

326
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,360
from inflating the numbers I mean they

327
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,220
place an incentive and you get action

328
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,040
get to work now buy our stuff because

329
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,940
wow 40 Millions attacks daily detected

330
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,940
by us we come to you and detect all

331
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,459
these attacks hitting you but it's

332
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,839
actually quite irrelevant I would be

333
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,639
interested how many of these

334
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:17,940
requests were actually dedicated attacks

335
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,220
by persistent threat attacking these

336
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,880
1200 website but that information is not

337
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,760
in the article and I'm pretty sure the

338
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,500
product is not able to give me that

339
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,899
information who has an interest inflate

340
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,000
number who's typically inflating numbers

341
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,940
spam detection software very high number

342
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,279
right the more spam you detect the

343
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,199
better bigger licenses you can say there

344
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
are license models around for every spam

345
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,339
message detected you get mores you have

346
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,699
an interest to get more spam somehow to

347
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:53,399
make money firewall administrators tend

348
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,220
to block a lot of Ip packages raising

349
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,279
the number of attacks it's only an IP

350
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
package and then right application

351
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,760
firewall operators people like me

352
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,459
somehow we have a tendency to inflate

353
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,560
the numbers because every request that

354
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,180
we're blocking is

355
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,440
an attack

356
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,740
when it's perhaps only a bullet good

357
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,399
even bigger numbers here is a report I

358
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,260
found online which came out in February

359
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,800
I believe yesterday in February a cycle

360
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,920
taxiary and they will talk about 300 000

361
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,740
New pieces of malware are created daily

362
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,560
yeah this is what happens when you

363
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,839
create them in an automatic manner

364
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,199
mean you run and it generates malware

365
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,240
for you that doesn't mean that it's

366
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,820
going to be deployed this is the

367
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,279
business these criminals are doing

368
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,740
so let's take a step back a step back

369
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,079
and remember the security resources are

370
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:50,760
always Limited

371
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,779
every dollar and every hour spent on

372
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,019
nonsense is a dollar without a return on

373
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,540
investment it's friction it's heating up

374
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,220
the climate if you want

375
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,380
so if you buy a license for some

376
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,019
commercial software based on a shitty

377
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,480
Report with inflated numbers

378
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,760
you're actively burning dollars in a

379
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,839
dumpster fire don't fall for such a trap

380
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,760
and shame on you if he creates such

381
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,199
reports with inflated numbers

382
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,120
consciously

383
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,980
or in a careless way because you think

384
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,500
every IP package bro blocked is actually

385
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,940
an attack

386
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:30,480
so we have an incentive to gain more

387
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,540
Bouche through inflated numbers and the

388
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,480
result is company resources misassigned

389
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,060
they flow to the highest number

390
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,639
or management stops trusting the reports

391
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,920
you tell me which one is worse of the

392
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,540
two options

393
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,040
so

394
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,279
we're getting close to dashboards now

395
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,339
these inflated numbers dashboards have a

396
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,820
tendency to show you inflated numbers as

397
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:59,000
well

398
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,920
in fact I've been suffering from

399
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,559
examining too many dashboards

400
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
why is that I'm working on a dashboard

401
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
myself I've been working on dashboard

402
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,160
all through 2022

403
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,619
and why is that because I've yet to see

404
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:16,199
a decent dashboard I've been in this

405
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,179
industry like 20 years or so doing a lot

406
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,919
of web application firewall web servers

407
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,439
security engineering and I've never seen

408
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:24,059
a good dashboard

409
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:26,400
here are two examples the top right is

410
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,319
the infamous Norse dashboard that came

411
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,919
out like 2016 or so it is animated so

412
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:34,799
what you see here is IP addresses

413
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,740
sending IP packages across the globe and

414
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,539
then they hit data centers and they

415
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,000
explode and it's really cool it's nice

416
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,340
Ice Candy and then lots of lists and

417
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,380
it's all animated and it grabs your

418
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,240
attention and you get the feeling this

419
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,220
is actionable for you this is something

420
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,140
where you have to do something about

421
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,179
this but that's not the case it's the

422
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,700
only show it's only eye candy

423
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:59,340
consequently Norse died a year or two

424
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,500
afterwards

425
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,080
nice video but that's not security what

426
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,120
you're getting here the lower left

427
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,580
corner is from the kibana documentation

428
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,820
this is an example dashboard that kibana

429
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,380
is proposing to you

430
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,080
and you should implement this is how you

431
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,500
could set up kibana to look nicely and

432
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,480
it doesn't have a lot of data I mean

433
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,880
it's a document it's documentation but

434
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,580
you get the idea already I mean the

435
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,799
numbers are too small but there seem to

436
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,580
be spark lines on top then we have bars

437
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,460
on the left the two very monolithic

438
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,700
blocks that's actually bar charts and on

439
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,600
top right and the lower right corner we

440
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,020
have two Donuts or modern variants of

441
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,080
pie charts so the the green areas on the

442
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,860
left

443
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,140
I mean what is the information I mean

444
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,760
there's no information it's just a block

445
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,280
of color doesn't tell us anything but do

446
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,559
the pie charts me and I'm explaining you

447
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,500
descent to lower the lower one here the

448
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,500
better colorful donut it Maps

449
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,440
colors to numbers that don't tell me

450
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
anything you cannot read the numbers but

451
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,179
khaki color means to 200 002 147 and

452
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:19,080
then the blue is 20002476.

453
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,900
that is information value in this and

454
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,400
this is in the documentation this is

455
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,080
what kibana is proposing for you to do

456
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:30,600
now what is the idea behind the

457
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,340
dashboard why do you want to have a

458
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,600
dashboard I mean it's nice you can show

459
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,860
it to management you can show it to your

460
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,179
friends and look at all the nice numbers

461
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,039
how many servers are doing and all the

462
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:39,419
attacks that we're getting look at all

463
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:41,480
these bullets flying in our Direction

464
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,620
the promise of the dashboard is

465
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,740
actionable actionability tells you hey

466
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,020
this is the information where you get to

467
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,860
work

468
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:53,460
and then you improve security

469
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,919
and a I don't understand what this is

470
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,200
telling me and B there is nothing I can

471
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,660
do based on these color blocks around

472
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,700
the pie charts I think pie charts are

473
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,380
really bad where usually if displaying

474
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,900
information I'm in a hate relationship

475
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,240
with pie charts I give you a next

476
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,520
example

477
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,140
um

478
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,100
yeah let's let's dive into this what is

479
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,260
the promise um

480
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,260
no I have to repeat this the point is

481
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,320
that dashboards tend to give you not

482
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,840
actionable information but ready

483
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,000
information actionable information would

484
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,299
be something you need to do something we

485
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,520
have an intermittent problem

486
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,340
focus on this problem and you improve

487
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,660
security

488
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,940
that is most of the time not what the

489
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,679
ACT what the dashboard is playing you

490
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,080
certainly not these dashboards here

491
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,660
but they're instead doing is displaying

492
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,980
to displaying you ready information

493
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,960
they have at their fingertips that they

494
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,200
can easily display to you to distract

495
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,960
you actually the result is distraction

496
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,200
the incentive is they do you a nice

497
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,660
dashboard and the result is you're

498
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,760
distracted by you're looking at the

499
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,980
dashboard the attackers continue to

500
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,660
attack you and you're not even seeing it

501
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,960
because the wrong information and

502
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,419
something that people in web application

503
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,320
firewall dashboard typically show is the

504
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,140
total number of attacks and total number

505
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,299
of bullets if you want hitting the

506
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,100
application that is completely

507
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,980
irrelevant who cares if you have a roof

508
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,260
on your house do you care how many

509
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,120
raindrops it stopped

510
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,940
are you interested in the number of

511
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:41,760
raindrops stopped per roof tile

512
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,480
do you want to see the metrics of the

513
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,659
average raindrop count stopped per hour

514
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:51,000
grouped by month

515
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,820
who cares about this it's

516
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,960
completely irrelevant

517
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,659
next one

518
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,700
this is an element of a typical of

519
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,440
application firewall dashboard

520
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,179
it's the rule alert so web application

521
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:07,919
viral work with rules and they

522
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
identified malicious requests and then

523
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,860
they blocked them and then they do

524
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,440
dashboards well it'll tell you hey this

525
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,659
is in for this is important this is what

526
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:17,640
I did this is where you put your

527
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,100
attention I mean obviously the top line

528
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,340
here must be the most important

529
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,580
information and the Top Line says we

530
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:30,299
have 1259 alerts on the rule host header

531
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:33,240
is a numeric IP address

532
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,620
that is

533
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,900
where they focus your in your head off

534
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,320
this is where dashboard proposes

535
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,240
incentivizes you to put your brain share

536
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,120
look at this this is important now as it

537
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,760
happens who triggers that rule it's

538
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,100
misconfigured local answers using the

539
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,740
host header the HTTP host header they

540
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,799
use it with an IP address when the RFC

541
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,299
actually says it has to be a fully

542
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,100
qualified domain name

543
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,460
it's sloppiness is misconfiguration if

544
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,559
you don't like this configurable opens

545
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,539
correctly and if you don't nothing bad

546
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:07,620
happens

547
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,159
uptime agents same behavior and then

548
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,320
people scanning the internet trigger

549
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,140
this rule yes it's an alert but who

550
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,919
cares that's not Danger somebody doing a

551
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,440
cheap scan of the internet is no threat

552
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,900
to you if that person is a threat to you

553
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,080
then you have far bigger problems

554
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,360
the threat to you are those people who

555
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,400
know how to set a host header correctly

556
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,919
so they don't trigger this rule

557
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:39,000
so what this dashboard element shows us

558
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,720
has a lot to do with Survivor bias

559
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,679
wrong incentives you probably notice

560
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,880
graphic it's quite famous in the

561
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,919
security industry it's a private second

562
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,039
world war this is a bomber an Allied

563
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,280
bomber and forever bomber returning from

564
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,860
the bombing mission in Germany they will

565
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,480
count the bullets and put them on the

566
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,440
graph

567
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,120
so every Red Dot is a bullet in a bomber

568
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,419
who survived a bombing Mission over

569
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:11,700
Germany perhaps

570
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,220
if you jump to conclusions quickly

571
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,640
you would go let's improve the armor on

572
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,980
the bomber where we have the red dots

573
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,140
isn't that natural I mean this is where

574
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,059
they have been hit we need to improve

575
00:24:24,059 --> 00:24:26,220
the bomber in these regions and that's

576
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,860
completely wrong

577
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,120
the point is

578
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,059
the bombers are already surviving hits

579
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,559
in that area

580
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,500
the problem is the bomber hit by bullets

581
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,159
that didn't return and chances are these

582
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,159
are the bullets that hit divide areas

583
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,460
those bombers didn't return so what you

584
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,980
need to do is improve the armor in the

585
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,220
area but there are no red dots here so

586
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,080
it's the other way around

587
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,220
by focusing on the wrong information

588
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,340
you're following the wrong incentives

589
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,799
and that's exactly the problem

590
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,860
with dashboards it's survivorship bias

591
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,159
it tells you what happened already the

592
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:13,080
stuff that you blocked it's the rain

593
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,299
that has been stopped by the roof the

594
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:17,039
one thing I'm interested in my roof is

595
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,860
where are the leaks I'm not interested

596
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,780
in the rain that it stops I'm interested

597
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,120
the rain that it didn't stop that is

598
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,240
ruining my house that is the problem

599
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,120
so there are two

600
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,059
pieces of information that are really

601
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:36,000
interesting here

602
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,080
a only request the target existing

603
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,020
service endpoints are relevant

604
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,179
people scanning the internet

605
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:47,159
are scanning everybody they're not

606
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,620
scanning your endpoints what is going to

607
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,820
happen with these requests they're

608
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,400
getting a 404 most of the time

609
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,960
they're not hitting your application

610
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,059
anyway so why do you care it's

611
00:25:57,059 --> 00:25:58,919
completely irrelevant

612
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:00,360
they're get they're triggering these

613
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,620
rules

614
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,440
on the dashboard but they wouldn't mean

615
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,440
no harm to you they're no problem and B

616
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,799
the real danger are requests by IP

617
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,880
addresses

618
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,760
that have triggered alerts

619
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,159
but they continue to improve their

620
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,120
attack

621
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,220
and then they bypass the rule set on

622
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,679
subsequent requests they're no longer

623
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,840
being blocked and then they start to hit

624
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,539
relevant endpoints these are the dangers

625
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,880
requests this will be actionable hey

626
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,260
look this is somebody who draw who run

627
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,539
into the firewall we blocked him on the

628
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:39,120
first two four six attempts but then he

629
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,279
got his act together and suddenly hit

630
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,020
the backend application now we need to

631
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,580
do something about it that is a real

632
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,799
attacker that is a persistent attacker

633
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,159
and I failed to see a dashboard ever to

634
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,200
give me this information and that would

635
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,220
be actionable and really important

636
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,380
so the incentives are look at the

637
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,620
seemingly interesting numbers and maybe

638
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,440
shiver in front of all the attacks on

639
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,520
your screen

640
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,260
and the result is while you look at

641
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,120
irrelevant track record

642
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,419
the attackers bypass the web application

643
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,159
firewall leaving no Trace

644
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,880
good

645
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,860
let's talk about bug Bounty Hunter I

646
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,000
think it's time to talk about Buck

647
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,100
bounty hunters do we have stock bounty

648
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,020
hunters in the room

649
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,918
don't be shy

650
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,659
we don't have bug Bounty oh there is one

651
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,779
at the very end hello

652
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,799
okay let's laugh a bit about Alex

653
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,900
uh our pen testers in the room

654
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,700
yeah they're far more pen tested that's

655
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,440
one of the problems far more pen testers

656
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,539
the backbone journals we get to you pen

657
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:50,460
testers immediately after the bug Bounty

658
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,820
hundreds that a deal good so background

659
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,740
300s have been around for a couple of

660
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,900
years please appreciate the hoodie photo

661
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,760
found is one of the photos have not been

662
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,799
used in any present sales presentations

663
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:04,440
before I even paid money for the photo I

664
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,700
like it so much it's so cool

665
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:10,500
so background has been around for a

666
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,820
couple of years at least in Switzerland

667
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,880
and we see tenances now in the market

668
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,039
there was a promise around Buck bounty

669
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,440
hunting I'm very much in favor of bug

670
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,179
Bounty Hunter as well I promoted that a

671
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,179
lot and now we're seeing how maybe we

672
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,640
don't really get what we expected from

673
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,640
this new technique maybe something else

674
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,980
is happening maybe it's still a net

675
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,720
positive but they're definitely

676
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,000
incentives at play here that are not in

677
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,520
favor of security and you see where I'm

678
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,240
taking this already

679
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:45,179
is our back bounty hunters interested in

680
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,620
security

681
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,779
we said probably yes yeah that's why

682
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:50,159
they work in security and that's

683
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:51,539
certainly one of the incentives how they

684
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:53,520
start to background in the first place

685
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,440
and the question margin Point our

686
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,419
background is interested in Securities

687
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,000
of the companies that they're probing

688
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,179
off the programs that they're working

689
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:07,260
for now Italy yes however in reality I

690
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,600
think the bounties are spoiling back

691
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,360
bounty hunters real quickly it's like

692
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,299
nice people entering an investment Bank

693
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,179
money spoils them really quickly I think

694
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:20,279
after a couple of months or years

695
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,799
they're more interested in personal Fame

696
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,440
that's how red teamers work anyway they

697
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
want to be the greatest hackers in the

698
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,440
world I mean think that's natural for a

699
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,120
red teamer so they're interested in

700
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,880
personal Fame personal Fame is directly

701
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,020
tied to monetary incentives

702
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,940
higher bounties means you're cooler than

703
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,880
the other guy so it's five digits

704
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,500
bounties that they're after

705
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,419
and how do you get five digits bounties

706
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,220
it's about automation of the bug

707
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,500
discovering optimizing ultimately it's

708
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,260
specialization the bug Bounty Hunter has

709
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,960
a strong incentive to specialize in

710
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,399
certain areas

711
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,980
as I came to see I have a limited Vision

712
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,059
on this I think it's cross-site

713
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,799
scripting a lot of bug bounty hunters

714
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:04,380
are specializing in cross-site scripting

715
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,779
because it's relatively easy to automate

716
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,480
and it promises big payouts it's a

717
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,240
growing industry nameless in Switzerland

718
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,720
more and more programs pop up it's like

719
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,640
mushrooms in Autumn more and more

720
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,399
programs but relatively few Buck

721
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,020
boundary Hunters around it seems only

722
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,820
Allah in the room is a buck Bounty

723
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,740
Hunter so there is a high demand for

724
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,440
buck Bounty Hunters by so many programs

725
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,940
and relatively little bug bounty hunters

726
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,880
program you struggle to get them onto

727
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,980
your program and then these guys are

728
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,440
specializing in a niche or in a certain

729
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,679
area and that means you get sporty

730
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,880
coverage

731
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,159
and the promise of the buck Bounty was

732
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:50,159
you had thousands of hackers probing

733
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,380
your servers and they left no stone

734
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,659
unturned and ultimately they will

735
00:30:54,659 --> 00:30:56,820
discover every weakness but what you're

736
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:59,580
getting now is five professionals

737
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,620
hitting you with all cross-site

738
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,659
scripting around and the rest of your

739
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,640
application is probably not covered

740
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,260
properly

741
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:11,419
let's turn to penetration testers

742
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,559
as I said I've been in this industry for

743
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,500
quite a long time and I've never seen

744
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,539
correct me if I'm wrong

745
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,179
open for feedback but I've never seen a

746
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:24,059
penetration test or killer project

747
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:25,380
no

748
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,899
you always write nice reports they

749
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:29,520
always have critical vulnerability

750
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,740
findings but whenever I read these

751
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,360
reports I mean I like these people I

752
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,640
liked it I'm I'm really a fan of

753
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,440
penetration test reports because it's so

754
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,360
interesting I learned so much I can

755
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,760
improve my setup and so on but I always

756
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,640
get the feeling it's very well balanced

757
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,840
the executive summary very often goes

758
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:52,080
you've done good work so far however we

759
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,880
realized that there's still a couple of

760
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,100
weaknesses in your application however

761
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,020
if you continue the good work then you

762
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,399
can make this work I mean you can do

763
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,899
this it's challenging but you can do

764
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,580
this and then we'll come back and do a

765
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,580
retest of your application

766
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,000
so I think the backbone add the

767
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,340
penetration tester has a very strong

768
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,159
incentive in a follow-up contract

769
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,559
and the result is

770
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,840
that the penetration test will not turn

771
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,140
every stone a penetration test is scoped

772
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,779
anyway so there is a contract but

773
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:27,299
there's a post to look at

774
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:30,059
but it's no where holistic will be too

775
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:33,659
expensive anyway and the result based on

776
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,640
this incentive for the next contract to

777
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:38,360
be nice that's right it's a nice

778
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,260
executive management summary is

779
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,679
a nice Contra and a nice report the

780
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,080
guarantees a follow-up contract

781
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,240
penetration tests tend to call this a

782
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,159
partnership a long-term partnership but

783
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:54,720
I think a long-term partnership is a

784
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,480
nice word for follow-up contract let's

785
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,640
continue to do business because I tap

786
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,380
your shoulder and you give me money for

787
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,120
it it doesn't mean it's not security but

788
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,360
it means you'll get a limited view of

789
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,179
the security of your online service the

790
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:14,460
penetration tester does not have an

791
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,399
interest to rip you apart by telling you

792
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:19,860
about things you've never heard of and

793
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,360
they're completely undermining security

794
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,039
of your setting you better stop working

795
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,679
today and drop that project

796
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,600
it's not how this works

797
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,200
the result is again spotty coverage

798
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,200
in the reports so no matter what you

799
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,360
seem to be doing need a penetration

800
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:39,539
tester nor bug bounty hunters give you a

801
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:41,519
comprehensive coverage of your online

802
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,080
service and their security in fact

803
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,600
nobody can give you a substantial

804
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,419
assessment of the services or the

805
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:51,000
security of your services the incentives

806
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,460
are simply playing against you and your

807
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,799
requirements and only time will tell but

808
00:33:55,799 --> 00:33:58,679
you're secure or not

809
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,320
good

810
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,059
let's look at the anthem breach probably

811
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,059
don't remember that was in 2050 15.

812
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:08,219
there was the biggest e-health patient

813
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,699
data data breach

814
00:34:10,699 --> 00:34:13,379
the incentives here and play are

815
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,460
business

816
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,980
they build bigger and bigger and larger

817
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,960
baskets and then they put all the eggs

818
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,320
in the same the incentive being

819
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,379
centralized digitalized

820
00:34:24,379 --> 00:34:28,080
consolidate to get better Revenue higher

821
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,159
margins

822
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,960
however the result is of course a

823
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,899
cluster risk and when the database is

824
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:36,540
exploited you lose all the eggs or all

825
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,480
the patient data obviously and if you

826
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,879
look through the newspaper article this

827
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,560
one is from Wall Street Journal the

828
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,560
affected product let me quote them are

829
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,080
called Anthem Blue Cross Anthem Blue

830
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,060
Cross and Blue Shield Blue Cross and

831
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:53,099
Blue Shield of Georgia Empire Blue Cross

832
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,080
and Blue Shield Amerigroup care more

833
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,380
UniCare these are all different brands

834
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:01,619
on the markets and they all came back to

835
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,339
the same database that was hacked

836
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:09,440
the incentives of business work contrary

837
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,079
to security very directly here

838
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,700
now a funny rumor is that Anthem

839
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,380
actually had a cyber insurance with a

840
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,300
coverage of 100 million and they used

841
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,460
all that money for the notification

842
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,660
process

843
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,540
so really bad for anthem

844
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,320
good crisis communication the incentives

845
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,480
are twofold

846
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,560
uh this example came up on Monday uh uh

847
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,380
Swiss pen testing company pentagrid

848
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,940
revealed that wizeka credit card company

849
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,859
of Switzerland had a weakness on the

850
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,180
server you could look up credit card

851
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,420
statements of companies without being

852
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,160
the owner of this data this is Heidi

853
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,260
news talking about it it was popularized

854
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,200
by the Republic uh Swiss German online

855
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,400
magazine on Monday and for the company

856
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,500
viseka they did not communicate this

857
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,960
certainly not with the end users however

858
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
they also informed the banks that are

859
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,260
connected to this user really really

860
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,940
late

861
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,660
um

862
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:10,320
so in crisis communication namely in I.T

863
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,960
security I think there are two

864
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:15,180
contradicting incentives to play one is

865
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,000
be proactive

866
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,940
be transparent about your problems talk

867
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,880
about it put everything on the table so

868
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,560
people can make up their mind and don't

869
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,180
downplay anything

870
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,700
however the second incentive would be is

871
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,619
a completely different strategy be

872
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,800
secretive be reactive don't talk about

873
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,560
it and don't admit anything that they

874
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,119
cannot prove to you

875
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,660
the promise of the second scenario is

876
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,079
nobody will find out and no problem

877
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,599
unless of course newspapers start to

878
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:50,339
talk about and then everybody will tell

879
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,660
you hey you should have been transparent

880
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,740
from the beginning

881
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,140
however I see in Switzerland the tenancy

882
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,079
to go with the second option

883
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:01,200
so far and they knew

884
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,079
media will will get this pentagrams

885
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,579
we're going to Publishers and they had

886
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:07,859
to expect me to jump on this they still

887
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:10,320
choose a not a problem

888
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,500
no problem at all and by the way no

889
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,240
customer data was ever revealed outside

890
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,760
of a single funny user in the Canton of

891
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,859
sweets and nobody knows why that record

892
00:37:19,859 --> 00:37:22,339
has been

893
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,800
leaked good

894
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,960
uh ransomware closely rated to that

895
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,339
ransomware is all the rage this here is

896
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,920
the first crypto locker from 80 from

897
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,619
1989 it's the 8th dos destroy and very

898
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:39,720
interesting you had to send a check to

899
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,060
Panama to get the decryption key

900
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,920
that business model didn't work so

901
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,599
nicely in the meantime they've replaced

902
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,180
Panama with Bitcoins and that seems to

903
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,820
work a lot nicer

904
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,520
I think

905
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,140
ransomware is interesting From rari's

906
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,180
perspective but one thing that I think

907
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,680
is very interesting is the question do

908
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,500
you pay are you not paying

909
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,260
paying means the pain goes away

910
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,079
immediately downtime is over you can

911
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,640
continue with your work unfortunately

912
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,160
the result is criminals get money in

913
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,300
their hands and they'll get much

914
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,700
stronger over time I seeing them getting

915
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,040
more and more leverage ultimately I

916
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,079
think it will be no question whether you

917
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:22,020
pay or not I think the longer this goes

918
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,839
criminal will force you to pay and you

919
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,599
cannot afford to not pay in the end over

920
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:28,680
legal

921
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,960
over legal threats or going out of

922
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,700
business immediately

923
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,940
and this question whether to pay or not

924
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,619
becomes even more interesting if you

925
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,300
look at Cyber Insurance there is

926
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,359
relatively little news about this but I

927
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,720
found this router's article where it

928
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,720
says insurers say some attackers may

929
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,520
even check whether potential victims

930
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,980
have policies that would make more

931
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,619
likely to pay out so if you manage to

932
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:00,300
get a cyber insurance policy covering

933
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,480
um covering ransomware that means the

934
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,180
moment ransomware head hits you the

935
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,400
Cyber Insurance takes over

936
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,619
then from a criminal perspective that is

937
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,599
really attractive because they get to

938
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,700
talk to the professionals they get to

939
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,619
talk to people to know how to transfer

940
00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:19,440
Bitcoins to cyber insurance company and

941
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,480
they also don't have to do presentations

942
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,220
where they present their business model

943
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,800
and the service offerings to the victim

944
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,660
so from

945
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,119
from attacker perspective it's very

946
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,180
interesting to attack somebody who knows

947
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,820
what the shot is somebody with a cyber

948
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,320
insurance

949
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,579
and from the perspective

950
00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:43,260
of the victim the thing gets more

951
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,460
complicated

952
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,820
that means the Cyber Insurance promises

953
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,780
coverage for your loss for your damage

954
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,000
but somehow there seems to be incentives

955
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,060
around that means you're probably more

956
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:59,579
likely to be attacked by having the

957
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:01,140
Cyber Insurance certainly if you

958
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,780
announce it or there have been cyber

959
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,060
insurances have been hacked so the

960
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,700
customer database was stolen and there

961
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,400
were datas where they had

962
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,960
uh

963
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,320
very subsequent attacks resulted from

964
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,859
the loss of the customer database

965
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,180
good

966
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,680
we started 10 minutes late

967
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,119
still have time I'm getting into my last

968
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,700
example now it also happens to be the

969
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,180
biggest one

970
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,980
good

971
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,420
this is come coming back to web

972
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,480
application firewalls this is like the

973
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,920
only topic I really know anything about

974
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,579
it the rest here was all somehow things

975
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,619
that sprung to my mind when web

976
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,060
application firewall I've been working

977
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,400
this for many many years and what is a

978
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,020
web application firewall for repetition

979
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,240
it is something you place in front of

980
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,119
your bank of your online shop that does

981
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,880
a first line of defense it inspects the

982
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,920
HTTP traffic and if it encounters

983
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,540
something suspicious malicious traffic

984
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,740
it blocks it and stops the attack from

985
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,720
being from hitting the backend

986
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,720
application it's like the first line of

987
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,300
defense an additional layer of security

988
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,520
in front of your application if done

989
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,099
right that contributes to security if

990
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:22,859
done wrong it's a lot of pain without a

991
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,980
return on investment my business case is

992
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,260
making sure you do have a return on

993
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,420
investment

994
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,859
good

995
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,380
there is a market of maybe 100

996
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,200
Commercial offerings around globally

997
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,720
including content delivery networks and

998
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,020
on cloud services and there is a single

999
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,880
open source offering the over Smart

1000
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,619
Security Coral set the project I happen

1001
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:49,200
to run in my spare time co-run in my

1002
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,140
spare time so as a commercial vendor you

1003
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,660
have two options 100 Commercial vendors

1004
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,099
around the day they had to ask

1005
00:41:56,099 --> 00:41:58,200
themselves the question

1006
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,740
do we want to create a rule set on our

1007
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:04,380
own do we want to build something to

1008
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:07,079
detect all kinds of attacks and sell

1009
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:10,440
this to our customers or do we integrate

1010
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,320
the single open source offering into our

1011
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,119
solution two-thirds of the market went

1012
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,280
with the second option one third of the

1013
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,320
market continues to develop their own

1014
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:24,180
rules set now this is a matrix based on

1015
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,640
a blog post by dormold macconlin it's

1016
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,859
two or three years old and he would look

1017
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:32,060
at commercial Cloud Web application

1018
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,859
firewall offerings

1019
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:38,160
and then vertically he would fire a text

1020
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,680
against them he would test their

1021
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,359
performance their security performance

1022
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:45,060
and then in the columns you have the

1023
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:47,700
different commercial offering first line

1024
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,839
we're only looking at the first line

1025
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:50,760
remote command execution remote command

1026
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,740
execution is very bad if you happen to

1027
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,440
execute this and it works then you have

1028
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,540
a root shell on the server that is not

1029
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,339
nice you want to defend against remote

1030
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:02,940
command execution mind you having the

1031
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:04,280
vaf

1032
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,079
ignore a remote command execution

1033
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:08,520
doesn't mean you have a root shell

1034
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,220
immediately it just means that the first

1035
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:14,280
line of defense failed you still need a

1036
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:16,800
weakness in your application so even if

1037
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,420
it's very red here that doesn't mean

1038
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,200
you're immediately

1039
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,480
exploited it just means that the promise

1040
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,359
of security was not delivered you

1041
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,819
purchased a commercial solution and it

1042
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:32,460
didn't work First Column is AWS buff

1043
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,020
that's what you get very cheaply from

1044
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:36,599
AWS it has a performance of four percent

1045
00:43:36,599 --> 00:43:39,180
of the attacks in the remote command

1046
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:42,720
execution category are blocked 96 of the

1047
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,300
attacks will bypass the AWS web at least

1048
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,260
two years ago next column is AWS

1049
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,119
Fortinet rule set so WS you can have

1050
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
commercial additional rule set the

1051
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,380
fortunate one is two and a half times

1052
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,540
better than the default one now we're up

1053
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,619
to 10 so only 90 bypassed above and then

1054
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:03,720
comes the third con column that's a

1055
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,720
stark contrast now we're over at the

1056
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,240
competition at Azure and in the second

1057
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,460
line you have in Brackets the core rule

1058
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:13,980
set that is my project Azure is based on

1059
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,960
Coral set they didn't develop their own

1060
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,900
rules primarily they use the open source

1061
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,000
solution and they get a green column now

1062
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,740
they're up to 71 they're seven times

1063
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,560
stronger than Fortinet by using the open

1064
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,420
source solution next one is Barracuda

1065
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:28,800
that's a company that's doing their own

1066
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:29,819
rules

1067
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:30,359
um

1068
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:33,180
again and then Alibaba I don't know what

1069
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:34,680
they're doing exactly but the fact that

1070
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,359
they have two green items means probably

1071
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:38,520
also based on CRS somebody told me they

1072
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,680
are but I've never seen hard date on

1073
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,680
this then you have Google cloud armor 73

1074
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,260
and in the final column cloudflare off

1075
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,920
also based on CRS everything green with

1076
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,720
the exception of the Alibaba cloud is

1077
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,440
known to be CRS and uh documented as

1078
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,760
being based on series I don't know

1079
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,859
exactly what cloudflare used to be doing

1080
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:01,680
two years ago uh in the remote command

1081
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,859
execution category I think they disabled

1082
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:06,780
rules and I also know for a fact they're

1083
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,400
improved in the meantime so now that

1084
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,740
might be green in the meantime but they

1085
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:12,599
disabled rules so the open source

1086
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:14,579
offering gave them detection capability

1087
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,800
and they disabled it

1088
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,140
and that leads us to the question why

1089
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,140
would they disable it and why would the

1090
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,780
commercial offerings or the commercial

1091
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,900
offerings being based on in-house rule

1092
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:31,619
set perform so much worse than the ones

1093
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:33,300
that use the open source offering why is

1094
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,000
the open source offering stronger than

1095
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,300
something commercial good let's look at

1096
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,220
the story

1097
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:43,859
that might might explain this once upon

1098
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:45,780
time there was a boy you probably know

1099
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:48,000
the story and the boy had it was a

1100
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,980
Shepherd actually he also had a remedy

1101
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,740
Shepherd and in his heart for diversity

1102
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,980
reasons and he would take the Sheep to

1103
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,420
the forest you know where I'm taking

1104
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,119
this and the Forester was a wolf

1105
00:46:00,119 --> 00:46:04,140
very bad so the boy screamed raised the

1106
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,599
alarm called The Hunters with the idea

1107
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,700
the hunters will come hunt down the wall

1108
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,980
for make mince meat out of the Wolf

1109
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,599
and it would be a big party in the

1110
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,579
village and everything was nice and it

1111
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,800
had no problem in the future our problem

1112
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,660
is it was a false alarm

1113
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:22,020
the boy called The Hunters but there was

1114
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,520
no wolf

1115
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,220
same happened the next day

1116
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,319
same happened the day afterwards false

1117
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,480
alarm snowballs the hunters gave up on

1118
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,220
the boy I mean the real wolf struck

1119
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:38,480
the real wolf struck

1120
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,020
I'll show you this one this happens

1121
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,599
good coming back

1122
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,339
whoop

1123
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:49,560
I think the story is very

1124
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,960
sad it's also very bad I think the way

1125
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,579
we're traditionally telling this story

1126
00:46:53,579 --> 00:46:56,700
is retelling the wrong way

1127
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:58,980
if you're a boy with a with sheep

1128
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:01,140
in a forest it's really hard

1129
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:03,079
there is a lot of missing information

1130
00:47:03,079 --> 00:47:06,359
the forest is dark it's very dense and

1131
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:08,579
the Wolf is very cunning so you don't

1132
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:09,359
know

1133
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,280
you hear something maybe you see

1134
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,839
something you don't know what is

1135
00:47:12,839 --> 00:47:14,579
happening exactly and you fear for your

1136
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:18,000
sheep so you call the hunters despite

1137
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,339
not knowing for a fact you're not really

1138
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:21,960
sure and you don't want to wait until

1139
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,000
the wolf has one sheep between his his

1140
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,760
Jaws you want to be early that's why you

1141
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,960
raised the alarm

1142
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,359
I think the boy has very bad press in

1143
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:32,579
this story but in fact I think the boy

1144
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:34,740
is in a very bad position

1145
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:38,099
and truth be told this is my story

1146
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:40,560
as an open source buff developers we're

1147
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,060
the boy the raising the alarm too early

1148
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:47,099
reprovoking false positives

1149
00:47:47,099 --> 00:47:48,599
and this is the cost of doing business

1150
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,640
why are we doing this because the

1151
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,700
incentives are aligned for us to produce

1152
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:55,800
false positive honestly if I produce a

1153
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,839
false positive that's really bad I'm

1154
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,640
sorry for the users I'm sorry for the

1155
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,859
customers maybe somebody was checking

1156
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:03,420
out an online shop and then a false

1157
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,940
positive happened business didn't happen

1158
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,819
company didn't sell something they lost

1159
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:11,040
money consequently and they complained

1160
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,839
to me and say look I'm really sorry for

1161
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:15,060
you but you need to handle this and you

1162
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:16,560
have to work around this here is the

1163
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,359
documentation to help yourself this is

1164
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:19,980
what I'm telling you ultimately I'm not

1165
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,500
affected or if I'm affected it's very

1166
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,680
very indirectly for my business

1167
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,980
however for a commercial company

1168
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,560
situation looks very much different for

1169
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,619
a commercial company if somebody is not

1170
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:36,720
able to do business despite the product

1171
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,520
they will get a call immediately hey

1172
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,400
look our CEO failed to log into our

1173
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,980
platform today and he was really pissed

1174
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,720
and you guys need to get your act

1175
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,700
together because if you don't we're

1176
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:50,339
stopping to pay you for the Sheep No we

1177
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:52,200
stopped to pay your license

1178
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,140
every false positive is a direct threat

1179
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,420
on the business model of a commercial

1180
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:01,440
vaf vendor it's very very bad to have a

1181
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,300
false positive for a ref vendor

1182
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:07,859
how about false negatives

1183
00:49:07,859 --> 00:49:09,839
for me I come to security conference

1184
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:11,339
we're going to do a coffee break

1185
00:49:11,339 --> 00:49:12,960
afterwards I want people to walk up to

1186
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,000
me and tap my shoulder and say hey I try

1187
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:17,220
to get past your CRS rules at last week

1188
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:20,040
oh boy it was tough I was working the

1189
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,720
penetration test and they had disabled

1190
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,940
the wife it was so strong good job

1191
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,160
that's what I'm into this game this is

1192
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,839
what I want to hear

1193
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,060
the last thing I want to hear people

1194
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,400
walking after me ha I run a penetration

1195
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,220
test into office that's a joke

1196
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,800
for you doing all the hours you spend in

1197
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,839
your spare time was no match for my

1198
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,180
attack skills that's the last thing I

1199
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:44,819
want to hear I want to make a very very

1200
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:48,119
strong wife that is not allowing for any

1201
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,280
false negative these are my incentives

1202
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:53,040
that's how the open source buff tries to

1203
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,140
be as strong as possible

1204
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:58,578
and the commercial buff

1205
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,859
tries to get out of the way of customers

1206
00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:04,560
they have a very strong incentive to

1207
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:07,740
avoid false positive and maybe a sect

1208
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,859
Falls negative we can in the coffee way

1209
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:14,339
explore the false negative situation

1210
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:16,619
in a commercial setup I think it's even

1211
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:18,960
more pervert than this but I don't want

1212
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:20,760
to dive into that in the presentation

1213
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,380
too long

1214
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,740
so time to wrap this up

1215
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,560
or time to come back to here now we have

1216
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,020
an explanation while the ones using

1217
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:33,900
commercial rules perform much weaker

1218
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,359
than the ones using open source rule set

1219
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:38,099
and then in case of cloudflare they

1220
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:40,500
looked at this and realized hey this is

1221
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:42,540
causing too much business problems so

1222
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,540
let's take out a few rules of the strong

1223
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:49,380
open source offering incentives are at

1224
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,240
play here and we need to look at the

1225
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,240
incentives to realize where do we get

1226
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,760
the strong product that delivers

1227
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,920
security and where do we get something

1228
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,220
that is a nice checkbox security

1229
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,839
interesting enough that is a graphic you

1230
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,819
don't see in the gardener report or the

1231
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:08,520
Forester bath quadrant the last thing

1232
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,260
they're looking at it is valve

1233
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:11,280
performance

1234
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,460
good time to wrap this up I see two

1235
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:16,440
levels of bad incentives

1236
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,020
and overly relaxed attitude ignorance

1237
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,319
negligence carelessness leads to bad

1238
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:25,800
incentives to users for users

1239
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,660
they tricked them into weak decisions

1240
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:32,299
that ultimately undermine security

1241
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,700
think bad dashboards eating your brain

1242
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,800
shares with nonsense because the guy

1243
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,020
developing the dashboard didn't think

1244
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,700
from your eyes from operating

1245
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:43,079
perspective what is actually important

1246
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:45,960
what is actionable what information is

1247
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,319
useful it was just carelessness on the

1248
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:50,839
second level however

1249
00:51:50,839 --> 00:51:53,460
people are deliberately following or

1250
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,680
setting crazy incentives for immediate

1251
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,160
gain Financial benefit through bad

1252
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,960
incentives they're consciously

1253
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,720
prioritizing Financial benefit over

1254
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:07,079
security of users and their data I see

1255
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:10,859
that one was a play here and Elon Musk

1256
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,020
shame on him

1257
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,079
so what we do about this I think it's

1258
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,319
our job it's your job to raise the alarm

1259
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,319
when you see incentives that are not

1260
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,240
aligned with security in the projects

1261
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,800
that you're working on you see people at

1262
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,660
the table who seem to have different

1263
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,660
incentives than the security goal that

1264
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,460
you actually have in mind you need to

1265
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,280
step back and think about incentives

1266
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,619
when you make your business decisions or

1267
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,839
technical decisions what are my

1268
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,880
incentives what are the vendors

1269
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,619
incentive what is the Consultants

1270
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,300
incentive what are the incentives of my

1271
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,700
boss of the ceso the security officer

1272
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,220
everybody at the table and if the

1273
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,240
incentives and security don't align then

1274
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,040
you need to cry wolf

1275
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,599
early enough

1276
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,500
thank you very much

1277
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:10,559
so we started a bit later than expected

1278
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,540
but it's almost coffee break can we take

1279
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,819
one or two questions Allah

1280
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,800
one question

1281
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,319
of course there is one question at the

1282
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,380
end out the back

1283
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,000
[Music]

1284
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,680
uh yeah I've I've actually got a comment

1285
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,359
not really a question because you showed

1286
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:30,059
us the wav companies and stuff yes I

1287
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:31,559
personally don't really believe it about

1288
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:34,680
dwarfs but um yeah uh so we're sure we

1289
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,119
are seeing this comparison between Maps

1290
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,980
the problem is I look at the blog post

1291
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,859
uh from the guy who posted it uh and

1292
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:43,260
there is no reproducibility in it yes so

1293
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:45,240
if we are doing such such a research

1294
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,240
please uh well post your scripts that

1295
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,700
you are doing uh the research with uh

1296
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,920
and getting the results out of uh

1297
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,079
because otherwise how can we really know

1298
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,000
whether this thing that we are seeing

1299
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,920
here is actually you know good or not

1300
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:00,960
like if you look at the examples they

1301
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,619
used in this uh research they for

1302
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:08,040
example sent to uh to some uh like an

1303
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,740
application hosted on AWS BB and one of

1304
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,200
the webs there uh some payload that is

1305
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,000
you know a command uh command injection

1306
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,339
payload for like PHP applications but

1307
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:19,740
what if your app is not really PHP then

1308
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:22,260
the market it as uh you know false

1309
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,380
positive or whatever like you're not

1310
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:27,839
detecting this and is that you know good

1311
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,700
probably not

1312
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,640
um and if you would like post uh or like

1313
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,140
publish your research like how did you

1314
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,839
do this do this then people can also you

1315
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:39,180
know improve yeah and point taking I

1316
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,380
mean trauma's Macon should have

1317
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,240
published uh the test scripts he used

1318
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,579
for this he didn't uh the reason I'm

1319
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:47,099
using this because he's third party I

1320
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:49,260
can reproduce this I'm getting more or

1321
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,960
less the same results uh for these tests

1322
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:54,599
but I'm obviously biased nobody would

1323
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:56,280
trust my numbers so at least he's

1324
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,760
thoroughly

1325
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,260
no I'm biased I mean I'm the wrong

1326
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,819
person to do that research you should do

1327
00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:07,440
the research and publish your results I

1328
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,980
mean nobody will trust my results anyway

1329
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,839
because I I have skin in the game

1330
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:15,780
obviously I'm the wrong person but

1331
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,040
somebody should do this properly he's

1332
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,140
just happens to be the only guy who did

1333
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,839
did a comparison and I think uh I mean

1334
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,339
Gardner and Forrester should do that

1335
00:55:23,339 --> 00:55:24,780
research I mean that's what they're

1336
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,079
selling anyway but the last thing is is

1337
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:30,540
a comparison of the performance of the

1338
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:32,220
products the garden and forests are

1339
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,200
recovering they're looking at nice

1340
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:36,599
dashboards and stuff and and machine

1341
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,579
learning artificial intelligence but

1342
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:41,700
ability to detect an escal injection is

1343
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,040
no criteria for them I think they should

1344
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,220
do that research yeah

1345
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,620
[Laughter]

1346
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,359
thanks um other questions

1347
00:55:54,359 --> 00:55:57,319
or remarks

1348
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,140
yeah there is one thank you

1349
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:03,000
I mean if I'm not getting any any bad

1350
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,559
feedback for this presentation then I

1351
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:06,059
will be disappointed it wasn't

1352
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:07,920
aggressive

1353
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:10,440
I got this feeling after this

1354
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,540
presentation that we cannot like Trust

1355
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,180
commercial vendors somehow because I'm

1356
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:17,160
always also I'm working as a security

1357
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,140
engineer and we constantly check for new

1358
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:21,240
vendors you know starting from vaf to

1359
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,059
static code analysis Dynamic analysis

1360
00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:25,559
and you know there are different vendors

1361
00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:27,480
and they try to sell you like oh how

1362
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,160
great we are but here we see that it's

1363
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:30,720
always the money

1364
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,720
is a huge incentive and how or what

1365
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,520
would be the good way to differentiate

1366
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,559
really understand are they

1367
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:41,160
really interested in giving us a good

1368
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,980
security product but rather than just

1369
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,920
keeping us you know on a three-year deal

1370
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:49,640
and then after that and so forth yeah

1371
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,180
honestly

1372
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:53,099
um I think a very strong negative

1373
00:56:53,099 --> 00:56:55,260
opinions on that as you've heard I'm an

1374
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,260
open source Enthusiast and I always in

1375
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,640
favor of

1376
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,040
and make up your mind yourself get

1377
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,720
knowledge and then you look at the

1378
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,480
program evaluate them but maybe not

1379
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,160
everybody can do that and maybe it's not

1380
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,079
as negative as that but I think what is

1381
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:12,180
definitely worthwhile is looking at

1382
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,800
incentives just take a step back and

1383
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,500
take a couple of minutes why are they

1384
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,260
doing this like that why is a spam

1385
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:21,599
detection software selling me a license

1386
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:23,700
on the number

1387
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:27,480
of spam detected why is

1388
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,059
um a log platform selling uh a license

1389
00:57:32,059 --> 00:57:35,460
based on the lines of of locks that

1390
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,619
they're logging so their incentive is

1391
00:57:37,619 --> 00:57:39,780
obviously to log more

1392
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:43,740
but is that security uh I think that

1393
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,839
when you look at these deals and

1394
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:47,220
offerings

1395
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,160
uh try to understand their incentives

1396
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,079
and then you see hey look no they have

1397
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,520
the right thing in mind and we know this

1398
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,660
company for a couple of years it's a

1399
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:56,700
good partnership yes we do follow-up

1400
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:58,559
contracts but we really benefit from

1401
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,200
this or do you see hey they just want to

1402
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,440
sell a license shiny leaflet and yeah

1403
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:05,760
I'm probably not the best partner to

1404
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,260
talk about discussions because I have a

1405
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,599
fair negative you in that but But

1406
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,339
ultimately amounts only a security

1407
00:58:11,339 --> 00:58:13,260
consultant myself so I have my own

1408
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:17,900
incentives to pay my bills ah

1409
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,180
the questions

1410
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,980
is there a demand for coffee in the room

1411
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:26,040
oh yeah another comment so regarding

1412
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:28,500
like uh fantastic stuff and like the

1413
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,020
incentive of you know cash and like not

1414
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:32,400
giving you a negative feedback because

1415
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:33,900
we want to work with you or something

1416
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,540
like that uh an interesting interesting

1417
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:38,520
aspect of that is that when you have a

1418
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,160
like an adversarial pen test or an audit

1419
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,440
or something like that so like you as a

1420
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,020
company pay another company to audit not

1421
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,480
your software but another software yeah

1422
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,000
and that's a really nice situation to be

1423
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,339
in like doing such an audit but you know

1424
00:58:53,339 --> 00:58:55,319
that's not enough uh that's an option

1425
00:58:55,319 --> 00:58:56,640
yeah and I haven't been in that

1426
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,380
situation but true then suddenly the

1427
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,059
incentive shift I think that's an

1428
00:59:00,059 --> 00:59:03,359
interesting puzzle good

1429
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:05,520
so let's go for the coffee then thank

1430
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:06,260
you for attention

1431
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:10,429
[Applause]
