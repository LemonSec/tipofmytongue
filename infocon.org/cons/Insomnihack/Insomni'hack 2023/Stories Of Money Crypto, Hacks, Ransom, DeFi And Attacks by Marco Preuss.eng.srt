1
00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,280
um I'm Marco I'm with Kaspersky I'm

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,219
researcher and manager at the Global

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:14,340
Research and Analysis team

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,120
um

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,400
the Global Research analysis team just

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,600
quick

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,359
um where the team globally distributed

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,140
what the name implies of course

9
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:28,080
mainly focusing on researching apt's

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
highly sophisticated attacks targeted

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,759
attacks look everything which is like

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,520
kind of interesting and needs more

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
digging into uh infrastructures

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,860
investigations and so on

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,559
after last year's talk in Geneva here

16
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,780
it's insomnia hack where I was talking

17
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,440
about exactly that like apt groups and

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,420
connections and things like that

19
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,420
this year I was thinking why not going

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,940
into a topic which is

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,640
getting more and more interesting more

22
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,500
and more important more and more people

23
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,440
getting into this fear

24
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,100
um while I still feel that the

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,420
information days in terms of security

26
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:14,040
attacks and things what's happening it's

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,159
kind of fragmented so from my

28
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,619
perspective I thought let's compile the

29
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,040
deck a talk to give the people from my

30
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,540
understanding what I think everybody

31
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,360
who's interesting in crypto and related

32
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,900
or even active in that sphere uh should

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,180
know should be aware of at least as a

34
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,479
baseline in order to understand and be

35
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,659
protected protect themselves I'm also

36
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:42,119
giving some hints so I'm going a bit

37
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:44,040
through usually I don't do agendas it's

38
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,299
just for you to briefly uh follow the

39
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,439
overall scheme I start with a few basic

40
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:53,820
things and the beginning is

41
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,640
understanding and then going from the

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,399
personal perspective a bit more into the

43
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:02,820
network side of things going to final

44
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,960
conclusions and stuff

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
threats one-on-one

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,780
there are many many different things

47
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:15,000
what could happen and let's stay first

48
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,540
at the moment at the personal side at

49
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,819
the user's side

50
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,760
from there every chest categorize it

51
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,340
into a brought it down into three

52
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:29,099
different categories first one crypto

53
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,379
checking

54
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:32,099
um

55
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:34,620
can either be persistent like on the

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,800
machine or web-based

57
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,459
um

58
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,860
right here

59
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,140
that usually implies that you have some

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,019
piece of metal or code running trying to

61
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:48,599
use the resources of the machine for

62
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,920
mining crypto it's a quite old scheme

63
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,920
um not always relevant it really depends

64
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,459
on the crypto itself

65
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:00,000
and

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,599
over the time there also are some quite

67
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,360
legitimate users of these kind of

68
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,060
schemes we're like getting rid of ads

69
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,480
but using this kind of like mining

70
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,739
resource usage in order to pay for web

71
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:18,420
service usage

72
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,480
so it's kind of an old scheme

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,599
um but still it's happening

74
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,019
an interesting and even though it's not

75
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,379
stealing any crypto from you personally

76
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,540
uh it may not be always good for your

77
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,319
Hardware of course

78
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
that's a simple thing here

79
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,840
which

80
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,080
oh my God

81
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,659
crazy PowerPoint sorry

82
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:50,940
the next thing which is

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,459
quite interesting because this is more

84
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,459
going into directly stealing things are

85
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:59,220
everything related to to theft

86
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,220
uh Steelers key loggers fake apps stuff

87
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,379
like that targeted attacks I leave a bit

88
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,959
out because I have a more a deeper look

89
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,080
at that a bit later

90
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
um

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,959
yeah one nice example there are many of

92
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:18,540
these schemes which popped up over the

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,660
time uh either on local machines

94
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,820
different operation systems but also on

95
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,280
mobile this is just one example of the

96
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:29,160
many many many out there people trying

97
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,960
to

98
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,900
um push fake apps in order to get to the

99
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,360
funds of the people using these kind of

100
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,120
software here for example an ethereum

101
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,880
wallet so if you would install it

102
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,280
um you're not the owner of that crypto

103
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,520
anymore which is

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,240
not not The Wanted thing

105
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,919
and the third part cryptoscam

106
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,220
and that's highly active especially if

107
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,979
you're also going into social networks

108
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:03,060
and stuff

109
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:06,240
uh either it's fishing or trying to just

110
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,240
grab your attention basically

111
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,000
making you believe you're missing some

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,360
unique opportunity once in your lifetime

113
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,639
fishing sites for all kind of different

114
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,280
main exchanges which are out there

115
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,800
these are just a few examples for like

116
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,699
Kraken binance and so on they always

117
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,960
come and go just in order to get

118
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,460
credentials and information in order to

119
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,639
get access to the people's funds stored

120
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,720
on these exchanges

121
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,220
hint

122
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,340
that's always a good thing if you don't

123
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,620
leave your crypto all the time on an

124
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:55,919
exchange if you're active in the sphere

125
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,240
but we come to that later as well

126
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,860
and the other thing what I mean with

127
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,060
like

128
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,720
tricking people into believing you're

129
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,240
missing your once-of-a-life chance to

130
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,600
get like one bazillion Euros whatever in

131
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,120
terms of crypto can happen on Twitter

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,440
Reddit is this example here on Twitter

133
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,539
uh so there is from my perspective no

134
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:23,880
real social network which is not

135
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,979
affected with that and it's always like

136
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,520
hey here free giveaway or we have this

137
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,340
fund going we're sharing between the

138
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,580
community and stuff like that

139
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,600
um

140
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,860
you you've easily spot this usually but

141
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,440
if you're not aware that this is a scam

142
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,479
for example if it's a well-known person

143
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,539
which is used for the scheme uh quite

144
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:50,220
often it was him but there are many

145
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,460
other examples as well

146
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,199
and you believe that person you follow

147
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,139
that person you think oh yeah this is

148
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,600
for the best of humanity and whatever

149
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,479
and now he's giving out free crypto yeah

150
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,300
let's be part of that and you just have

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,639
in most cases you just have to pay like

152
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,979
a small fee of ethereum Bitcoin whatever

153
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,699
kind of crypto and then you're in this

154
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,940
fund and you get back the tenth amounts

155
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,039
or hundreds amount of what you transfer

156
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:22,919
to that fund

157
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:26,039
sounds too good to be true it exactly

158
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:29,060
that's what's Happening Here

159
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,199
um

160
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,819
fake exchanges is a bit more advanced

161
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:39,800
um these are real kind of your real

162
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,840
functioning exchanges

163
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,180
where you create an account

164
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,180
and then they say oh yeah you can start

165
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,479
here and it's super easy low fees or no

166
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,240
fees at all and whatsoever just to

167
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,460
activate your account and be able to

168
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,080
trade crypto

169
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,020
you just have to transfer a small amount

170
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,060
of crypto to The Exchange

171
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,639
and then you're in the game and you can

172
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:07,680
do whatever you want

173
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
people who are not really familiar with

174
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,599
so I've seen this a lot of times this is

175
00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,180
just one example of the many many out

176
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,740
there

177
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,460
um

178
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,160
fall into that if they're not fully

179
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,639
aligned with what exchanges are there

180
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,300
which ones are trustworthy or not

181
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,879
um because this area still is not really

182
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,399
easy to overlook

183
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,640
foreign

184
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,579
let's take one step back

185
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,440
not only the technical aspects are

186
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,620
relevant but also a bit what do the

187
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:52,560
people see themselves

188
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,519
and for this we are together uh with

189
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,420
Arlington research did in research on

190
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,000
like a questionnaire about different

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,820
people 12 000 people different groups

192
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,760
like regular users

193
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,320
owners passive owners of crypto

194
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,500
non-owners of crypto to get a bit of

195
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,140
their understanding

196
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,260
um and feedback about crypto itself and

197
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,940
I think that's quite interesting because

198
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:25,080
over the years from 2019 uh where it was

199
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,560
done first to 2022 last year which has

200
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,320
started in 2023

201
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,500
um the awareness of crypto already Rose

202
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
tremendously

203
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,200
um in some countries like Far Eastern

204
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,500
for example it's a bit higher

205
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,420
um but generally

206
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,000
nearly one-third of people are aware of

207
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,160
yeah there is this thing called crypto

208
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,140
whatever

209
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,300
um but nearly half of people are afraid

210
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,260
to invest into of course it's volatile

211
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,080
um drawbacks and so on

212
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,899
and there's threats

213
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:06,660
not really many people are aware of

214
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,220
threats and that's that was also one

215
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,660
thing where I thought okay let's let's

216
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,000
push this topic a bit more out and talk

217
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,180
about this uh what's really going on

218
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,940
what kind of threats are there

219
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,940
um and not many people really have

220
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,920
enough information that that's also one

221
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,440
thing what I see quite often uh for

222
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,480
example on Reddit and whatever newcomers

223
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,640
come hey how can I get into crypto and

224
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,980
so on and depending

225
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,560
if they're good people or not not good

226
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,200
people replying to this threats uh

227
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,959
people can get tricked or not

228
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:43,200
which is not the best way to go so it's

229
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,220
important to like share information

230
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,600
share knowledge with everybody

231
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,700
um

232
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,100
and top concerns especially the three

233
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,440
pillars what we just had before so

234
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,860
crypto theft is is a kind of leader uh

235
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,720
followed by scam crypto chatting

236
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,940
checking not so much as I said before

237
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,839
because it may also be used for

238
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,860
um not criminal but uh legal kind of

239
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,320
activities

240
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,880
um especially in Europe also

241
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,700
blackmailing is one thing people are

242
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,300
concerned about

243
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,079
so

244
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,760
and one of the for me personally most

245
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:35,160
interesting thing is and that's kind of

246
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,279
contrary to what I initially always

247
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:41,220
thought about like people interested or

248
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,380
active in crypto about regulation so 32

249
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:50,519
percent of the people we asked supported

250
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:51,600
um

251
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,120
enforceable laws and more regulation

252
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,560
towards crypto which kind of

253
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,660
I'm not sure

254
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,200
main idea behind many crypto projects is

255
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
kind of freezer freedom decentralization

256
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,060
and stuff like that

257
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,160
um which may be tricky to implement

258
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,200
proper regulation and stuff like that

259
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,800
which usually in many areas focus on

260
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,060
more centralized kind of schemes

261
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,700
so having that set

262
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,040
let's dig a bit deeper into the rabbit

263
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,120
hole

264
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,160
um by the way just as a

265
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,140
in between disclaimer

266
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,680
I'm not talking either against nor in

267
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,180
favor of crypto

268
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,100
just for your understanding

269
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,260
it's just about sharing information

270
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,820
um targeted attacks

271
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,820
which is kind of interesting because it

272
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,279
shows

273
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,860
more advanced things

274
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,420
uh what also active

275
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:02,100
apts and advanced groups are doing

276
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,839
um

277
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,300
there are many many apt groups advanced

278
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,560
persistent threats if you're not

279
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,380
familiar with that term

280
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,360
so very very highly professional

281
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,279
groups of actors

282
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,240
um in most cases conducting Espionage

283
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,420
attacks sometimes on rare cases also

284
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,180
kind of sabotage destructive attacks

285
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,220
but there is this one

286
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,680
this one group

287
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,920
which is also actively stealing money

288
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,160
and that's Lazarus and one of their

289
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,399
subdivisions blue norov

290
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,459
um they were already known maybe you

291
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,160
heard it from the Press

292
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,920
many successful attacks against Big

293
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,040
Bangs getting out a lot of money

294
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
and because there is a lot of money in

295
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
crypto as well that's also an area there

296
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,639
trying to get into or already into uh

297
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,779
for quite some times

298
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,019
one of the more recent and quiet huge

299
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,120
investigations we did you can also look

300
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,420
it up here at secure list it's a very

301
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,839
long detailed analysis to get all the

302
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,300
technical aspects of that so I just give

303
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,579
brief overview about things

304
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:28,620
which are interesting

305
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,320
first of all blue norov Lazarus victims

306
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,040
are not locally bound to any kind of

307
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,760
region mostly they're active in Asia but

308
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,279
also Europe North America Russia and so

309
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,880
on so where's money

310
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,339
they try to get into and get the money

311
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,720
in this specific scheme and that's quite

312
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,639
interesting

313
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:56,459
let me tell the story

314
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:57,660
um

315
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,420
they first try

316
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:04,620
to stalk and monitor

317
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,440
not only individuals but also crypto

318
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,380
startups projects

319
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:14,639
um and monitor their activities try to

320
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,220
understand social interactions this can

321
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,519
go on for weeks and months to fully

322
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,940
understand how this team how this

323
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,699
company is set up who communicates with

324
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:30,240
whom about what and how what topics are

325
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,660
interesting and with all of that

326
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,699
intelligence they gathered over a long

327
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:39,060
period of time with no no direct attack

328
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,240
happened it's just monitoring it's just

329
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,959
simple silent monitoring about the peer

330
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:47,040
structure

331
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,279
with that intelligence they try to craft

332
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,180
super highly quality spearfishing

333
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,540
attacks in order to trick these people

334
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,839
specific people they selected

335
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,240
um with the direct attacks which can for

336
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,660
example be uh these kind of things Word

337
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,420
documents that's quite a very famous and

338
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,779
often used scheme they're doing

339
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,600
um agreements assess investment

340
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,760
strategies

341
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,819
um

342
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,399
topics that's the trick here

343
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,060
so you open it it's a Word document and

344
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,380
it's a maliciously crafted Word document

345
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,199
trying to get

346
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,240
um

347
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,079
from a remote source

348
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:43,259
to load script gets executed and then

349
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,720
infect the machine so it's a weaponizing

350
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,540
documents it's

351
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:52,319
quite an old cve 2017-0199

352
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,259
they try this quite often and if that's

353
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:57,779
not working they've tried to go through

354
00:16:57,779 --> 00:17:00,540
other ways but usually because

355
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,180
they have this kind of high quality

356
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,000
spear phishing attacks there is no need

357
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,459
to drop a no day

358
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:11,220
which saves them money

359
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,100
for the biggest profit very easy

360
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,240
the execution

361
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,579
um I'm not a big fan of this

362
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,520
this system works a bit different than

363
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,700
mine so sorry for that

364
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,620
um

365
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:36,000
so as I said you get especially

366
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,539
targeted spear phishing email to that

367
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:41,520
company

368
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,780
um

369
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,020
with a word okay statement what I just

370
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,840
showed you and there they doing a

371
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,220
fingerprinting which is quite

372
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,380
interesting because it's not just random

373
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,299
not everybody who gets that will also

374
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:57,600
get into the next stages so they do a

375
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,360
proper fingerprinting

376
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,500
uh check

377
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,299
um the target of course

378
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:07,260
and then either share the template like

379
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,140
the remote document or just nothing

380
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,740
sorry like that or just nothing and

381
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,020
that's it

382
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:20,039
um if they got this additional code

383
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:22,679
um the system gets infected and then

384
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,780
this recent attack that was quite

385
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,700
interesting that's also why I put this

386
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,620
here they were not only going towards

387
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:33,600
spying stealing stuff which is uh just

388
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,419
on the system but also actively going

389
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:40,260
into probably one of the most famous uh

390
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,500
wallets used out there metamask

391
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,780
so they check if that's installed and if

392
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,000
it's installed

393
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,860
um they

394
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,960
rework the code

395
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,400
which is super tricky to identify

396
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,580
you can do it if you actively look it up

397
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:01,740
and see if the source is proper Chrome

398
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,880
web store or uh if it's unpacked

399
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,740
extension because what they're basically

400
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,020
doing they're changing the locally

401
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:13,020
stored JS files of that browser

402
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,419
extension

403
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:18,720
in order to do either two of two things

404
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,080
or both after one another the first one

405
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,179
as a code injection

406
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:27,660
this is just a small subset you cannot

407
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,480
easily spot this because that file is

408
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,660
huge it's a few megabytes with hundreds

409
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,500
or thousands of lines of code the

410
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,600
background.js it's called I think uh if

411
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,820
I remember correctly from metamask

412
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,160
and what they're doing here is just

413
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,640
monitoring so they add piece of code

414
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,419
which just do monitoring so since all

415
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,320
the information about all the uh

416
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,020
Transmissions going on from metamask

417
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,820
um to their back end

418
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,580
and we believe that they have quite some

419
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,460
intelligent monitoring about crypto

420
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,580
transactions and if they have a valid

421
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:11,820
Target it was quite some crypto in that

422
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,500
wallet

423
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,860
um they will just do and they have an

424
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,980
additional piece of code they add they

425
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:20,250
add

426
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,780
[Music]

427
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,120
um to steer the tokens and here comes

428
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,860
the thing and that's always this

429
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,140
interesting part

430
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,720
um many would say like yeah no problem I

431
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,460
have a hardware wallet so I see what's

432
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,760
going on and I can sign it and I don't

433
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,220
rely on the software itself

434
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,320
yes and no

435
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,539
um they're basically waiting for the

436
00:20:42,539 --> 00:20:44,760
user to do a transaction

437
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,520
and you have to actively sign it with

438
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,160
your Ledger whatever kind of Hardware

439
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,200
wallet

440
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,299
um and just change it

441
00:20:54,299 --> 00:20:57,480
with this attack code

442
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,539
to it transfer the full funds what they

443
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:02,700
have in their wallet at once

444
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,440
you sign up because you think like yeah

445
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,660
it's a transaction I just initiated in

446
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,760
the software so I trust myself I just

447
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,100
click transfer you sign it you don't

448
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,919
check the stuff come come on hike who

449
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,919
reads all the the the hex codes on on

450
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,960
your Hardware wallet you sign it and

451
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,380
it's gone

452
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,059
that's the thing about Hardware wallets

453
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,640
they protect your keys

454
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,640
but still you're the user and if you're

455
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,820
tricked into signing something

456
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,820
no one can protect even the hardware

457
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,980
wallet cannot protect you from doing

458
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,679
that because you actively said like yeah

459
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,140
that's fine that was me it's my

460
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,700
transaction

461
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,220
do it

462
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,620
another attack

463
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,620
um also we have um this article up on

464
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,380
secure list by the way I have my contact

465
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,600
details at the last slide if you're

466
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
interested in that slide I can share

467
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,320
that

468
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,620
um what they're doing here is

469
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:10,320
um the piggyback on a regular software

470
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,860
um so you download an installer and in

471
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,020
that installer you have a regular

472
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,720
application and a malicious application

473
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,419
and that malicious application then

474
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,539
changes uh the legitimate one

475
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:27,179
but you think oh yeah it's a legitimate

476
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,039
edification no problem you see the

477
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,539
regular installation screen and

478
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:31,880
whatsoever

479
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,440
you're not aware of what's happening in

480
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,700
the back end

481
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,780
and they did this with a D5 wallet so

482
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,240
this is proper and everything but in the

483
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,640
back end there is a Steeler running

484
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,000
trying to get the information from the

485
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,880
machine and so on stealing all kind of

486
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,059
personal information from the machine

487
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:56,400
so these are just two

488
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,220
huge things what they did towards Define

489
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,720
crypto

490
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,880
quite interesting and especially this

491
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,799
part about Hardware wallets so keep that

492
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,840
in mind that's important to remember

493
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,340
um another quite recent actor knife copy

494
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:16,080
who

495
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,659
like that

496
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:19,380
um

497
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:23,760
they're active since some were 2021

498
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,940
before they mostly also use this scheme

499
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,080
of

500
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,360
um office documents

501
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:33,720
but they also included in their more

502
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,360
recent attacks binaries so for example

503
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,440
this

504
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,280
um

505
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,000
binance certification setup thingy which

506
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,880
of course is not legit

507
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,960
effect

508
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,720
but you think like yeah I need to

509
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,640
install that certification click click

510
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,760
click installed you see the uh the legal

511
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,799
notes and so on after the installation

512
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:59,760
so looks proper and everything but

513
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,640
um of course you're just fell victim to

514
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,559
a malicious binary

515
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,380
these are just a few examples of what

516
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,440
can happen and is actively happening on

517
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
the user side of things

518
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,720
maybe you spotted already against the

519
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,720
few or most of these things you could do

520
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,039
something

521
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:29,000
you have your proper security software

522
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,299
you have a super good procedure when you

523
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:35,700
get like emails or paying through the

524
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:38,039
social networks

525
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,480
um maybe not but let's just assume that

526
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,200
um

527
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,840
so against a lot of these more locally

528
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,659
focused threats you could do something

529
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:53,760
but the interesting thing about crypto

530
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,159
it's not a local thing

531
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,260
and it would be too easy to say oh yeah

532
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,299
the internet is global and social

533
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,760
networks for example are also Global and

534
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,220
social connection yada yada

535
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,919
but the specific thing is that also a

536
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,280
lot of intelligence and the real core

537
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,860
is a distributed blockchain right I mean

538
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,000
that's

539
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,500
the full core about what crypto is right

540
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,220
um

541
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,940
and one thing emerged

542
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,159
over the past

543
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,740
few years more and more because more and

544
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,260
more functionalities were added

545
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,140
to Major blockchains and that's

546
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,299
so-called defy

547
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,679
stands for um which decentralized

548
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,779
Finance basically means peer-to-peer

549
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,880
Financial Services

550
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,520
I try to stay away from passwords so

551
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,320
this is not a password talk we are

552
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,820
technicians here we're talking about

553
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:55,260
security right so let's not do that

554
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:57,900
um but still it's this is something

555
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,760
on top of a few blockchains for example

556
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:06,120
ethereum is probably one of the most

557
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,100
dominant ones in that area but also

558
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,919
Solana polygon there are some additions

559
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:13,559
to bitcoin itself but a traditional

560
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,860
Bitcoin is not considered to be like

561
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,520
that D5 kind of thing because D5 means

562
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,100
that you have for example smart

563
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,500
contracts on a blockchain that's

564
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,539
something yeah everybody when you hear

565
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:29,760
smart contracts oh yeah ethereum I know

566
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,720
that

567
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
right so it's a piece of code basically

568
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,960
a contact a a contract written in code

569
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,059
stored on a blockchain and you can

570
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,159
interact with that it's used for for

571
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,740
example for funding for landing of

572
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,440
crypto staking and that kind of things

573
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,000
um there are a few more things also uh

574
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,220
so-called d-apps so distributed apps

575
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,159
also running on a blockchain

576
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,820
which are often used for so-called decks

577
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,960
distributed exchanges

578
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,120
so what we've just seen before like

579
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,760
binance Kraken coinbase and so on their

580
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,460
centralized exchanges it's one entity

581
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,020
you go to that one website and you

582
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,380
buy or sell or trade crypto at that one

583
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,440
centralized entity

584
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,880
Dax means you have on that blockchain

585
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,440
distributed an exchange running like

586
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,480
uniswrap for example

587
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,880
and that's also a D5 application

588
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,080
basically

589
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,140
there are different understanding

590
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,000
understandings of what D5 is but let's

591
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,220
not get into this passwording kind of

592
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,340
thing

593
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,419
um

594
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:46,140
having a look at here now

595
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:50,460
um a D5 attacks itself I also added come

596
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,240
on

597
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,580
yeah

598
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:56,039
there is this nice website llama

599
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,860
um very nice if you're interested in D5

600
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,320
projects and things have a look at them

601
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,000
they also track a lot of hacks happening

602
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,220
and that was quite interesting when I

603
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,500
looked at that you see clearly that

604
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,039
especially the last year 2022 that was

605
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,200
painful for defy

606
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,539
because many many hacks happened and

607
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:21,600
we're not talking about like centralized

608
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,960
exchanges like FTX or whatever dropped

609
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,039
or volatility of of crypto but no this

610
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,480
is a tax going on on the D5 scene

611
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,460
and with quite some losses I mean when

612
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,120
we're talking about nearly six Dot yeah

613
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,419
four or five billion US dollar

614
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,059
that's a number

615
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:47,760
right I mean come on who doesn't want to

616
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:52,020
have six nearly 6.5 billion dollar right

617
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,679
um

618
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,900
yeah let's go through a few of them

619
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,000
because that's interesting because this

620
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,279
is these are things

621
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,640
you have no Direct Control about that's

622
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,299
why I say that's the network that's what

623
00:29:06,299 --> 00:29:07,740
you're using

624
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,080
and you need to trust it

625
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,080
and you need to know what's going on

626
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:17,059
and there it can get complicated

627
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,500
um let's pick a few examples and go

628
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
through a few incidents which happened

629
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,399
with a bit of technical stuff going on

630
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,399
um one or probably the biggest hack

631
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,020
happened and D5 was the Ronan heck more

632
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,740
than 600 million dollars were stolen

633
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:41,100
and the problem here was a private key

634
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,200
was compromised not only one but a few

635
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,779
like five

636
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:47,880
and they had some mistakes on the

637
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,980
configuration

638
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,880
so blockchain D5 peer-to-peer means you

639
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,020
have basically a lot of physical servers

640
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,440
running somewhere around the world

641
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,659
can be VMS whatever doesn't need to be

642
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:05,820
physical machines but you know it's

643
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:10,020
systems running the core the back end of

644
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,700
the blockchain on which these things

645
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:16,080
gets executed so and they have their own

646
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,240
back-end structure servers and out of

647
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,360
the many they have five private Keys

648
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:27,000
like the keys to validate to set up to

649
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,120
host to run to operate these machines

650
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,740
were hacked

651
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,940
and one that's the exide AO

652
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,440
um was sadly

653
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,740
misconfigured in a allow list

654
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,279
to distribute like free transactions and

655
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,559
that was basically you got the private

656
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:50,580
key

657
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,320
you had a misconfiguration in the

658
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,399
network

659
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,679
and the attackers have used that and

660
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,500
transferred of 600 million dollars

661
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,960
sounds easy but first you have to

662
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,820
understand that Network so there is

663
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,559
quite a lot of effort in doing that

664
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,640
um

665
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,960
as I said that was the biggest one

666
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,580
I also have here

667
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,299
um

668
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,940
some links to that as I said I can share

669
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,460
later on

670
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,559
the interesting point here like the

671
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,200
second interesting point besides being

672
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,020
probably the biggest uh D5 hack is that

673
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,700
nearly a month a bit bit less than a

674
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,340
month later after investigation there

675
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,020
was an official announcement by US

676
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,480
agencies that the attack was attributed

677
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,679
to

678
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,340
you guessed it right Lazarus oh yeah we

679
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,899
just talked about Lazarus before

680
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,720
interesting

681
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,380
um

682
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,419
looks like that

683
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:57,539
um a lot of text Lazarus crew Piada

684
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,419
and this here is the interesting big key

685
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,059
because that's for these stolen funds

686
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,000
got transferred to

687
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,480
um that's again the good side on a lot

688
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,460
of crypto projects

689
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,320
that would the blockchain mean you have

690
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,539
the full database of the transactions

691
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:19,020
that's not true for all crypto keep that

692
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,760
in mind that's important

693
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,000
you cannot follow other transactions for

694
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,580
all crypto there are a few which are

695
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,000
encrypted and there's at the moment no

696
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,659
real way to see into that for example

697
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,299
Monero that's often said to be like yeah

698
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:38,580
super secure and then some companies

699
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,520
said like yeah no we can monitor it yeah

700
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,840
no

701
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,580
it's still

702
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:47,700
trying to break it but it's not the case

703
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,240
at the moment

704
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,779
um another Super interesting thing

705
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,360
um it was a bit less than the Ronin hack

706
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,419
was the poly Network hack also more than

707
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:03,179
600 million US Dollars stolen so we're

708
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:06,240
talking about money right like

709
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,059
uh and there was a problem uh there was

710
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,179
a direct yeah vulnerability and the code

711
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,380
of this D5 project which was exploited

712
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,799
that the attacker caught modified the

713
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:23,580
so-called keeper on that thing uh like

714
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,100
in that uh contract that's running on

715
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,080
the um

716
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,399
ethereum based blockchain

717
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,000
and with the excess control exploit they

718
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,039
were able to grab out the money that's

719
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,539
it

720
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:39,799
600 million dollars

721
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,080
um

722
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,019
interesting and quite

723
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:48,840
often used in many many different

724
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,299
attacks

725
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:55,580
is the re-entrancy attack

726
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,100
landf me hack burgersweb but many many

727
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,919
others so really it was quite a list

728
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,200
especially last year where this attack

729
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,600
was used

730
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,379
um so I'm just explaining the principle

731
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:11,699
um

732
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,580
you set up a malicious contract and that

733
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,879
malicious contract has some changes to

734
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:19,510
regular contracts

735
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,940
[Music]

736
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,000
the attackers contract asked from the

737
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
main contract oh yeah here get me

738
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,699
one ethereum let's put it simpler one

739
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:33,239
exterior and that's okay I sent you the

740
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,820
funds send the funds

741
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,159
one ethereum here

742
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,040
and before the balance gets updated it

743
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
says like hey come on send me one

744
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,540
ethereum and it checks like oh yeah

745
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,599
there is zero ethereum here because

746
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:50,219
that's the idea of this malicious

747
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:53,280
contract I have no ethereum here and it

748
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,320
sends one ethereum and that basically

749
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,839
goes around and around and around

750
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,900
it's a logic flaw basically it's it's

751
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,420
this should not happen anymore

752
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,880
but it was actively used in many attacks

753
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,839
last year

754
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,440
that was also one of the reasons why

755
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,820
more and more D5 projects get their code

756
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,339
checked and reviewed were against

757
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:19,619
especially these kind of attacks it's

758
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:22,619
checked that if it's possible or not to

759
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,200
do these kind of super simple

760
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,380
super simple attacks I mean that's a

761
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,180
no-brainer kind of thing

762
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:33,540
it should not happen anymore

763
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,180
but that are the things you have to be

764
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,760
aware of if you're interested or active

765
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,859
in that sphere

766
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:44,579
did they check their contracts and stuff

767
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:48,140
against these kind of attacks

768
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,160
um yeah also yeah

769
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,680
another interesting thing

770
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,099
and that's a bit tricky because

771
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:00,540
um

772
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:04,560
It's tricky because how do you evaluate

773
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,680
if it's attacker or not

774
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,839
so let's put it like this flash loan

775
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,720
attack means you get a flash loan flash

776
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,720
loan you have a provider and you can

777
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,359
lend certain amount of money everybody

778
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,640
from us knows that I mean with the

779
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,240
credit card the same you go to a bank

780
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,160
basically you say oh yeah can you lent

781
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,400
me a 100

782
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,800
euros dollars whatever Bank says oh yeah

783
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,900
here is it but when you pay it back you

784
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,240
also have to pay an interest of I don't

785
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,160
know 10 euro whatever

786
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,359
um you do something with the money and

787
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,040
then you have to return it back after a

788
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,300
period of time

789
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,160
flash loans is basically a similar

790
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,280
principle but much more faster

791
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,619
so we're not talking about like days

792
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,720
weeks months years whatever you're

793
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,599
taking the loan but very short times and

794
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,200
in that cycle of the loan you're

795
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,520
requesting

796
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,440
you have to do something with the money

797
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,480
but you have to pay it back

798
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,420
if not the whole chain what you were

799
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,260
doing

800
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,900
gets reverted

801
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:16,920
so it's kind of a contract it starts and

802
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,220
only if the Finish is reached the

803
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,460
contract is fully executed if not

804
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,859
everything gets reverted

805
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:28,400
quite an interesting thing

806
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,280
so basically what could be done is you

807
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,500
take a flash loan the attacker does

808
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,540
something with it

809
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,240
arbitrust trading liquidations whatever

810
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,920
kind of things

811
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,619
can malicious Trading

812
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:47,339
changing things price oracles for

813
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,619
example and just showed in the next

814
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,720
example something which could also have

815
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,720
been based on a flash loan attack

816
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,320
and then money done and you pay back the

817
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,800
loan and you're left with money

818
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,079
simple principle if you take into

819
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,780
consideration what I said

820
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,760
the

821
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,440
so-called price Oracle attack

822
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,140
and that's one step further

823
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,440
happened to the mango Market

824
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,740
um there is I always have to add to

825
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,500
click twice to also cut the link there

826
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,740
is a nice write-up on Twitter under this

827
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:32,339
name of the guy who like did it with

828
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:33,780
like screenshots and everything and

829
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,820
explained everything so I'm just giving

830
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,460
a very brief overview about how this

831
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,359
happens so price Oracle is

832
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:45,480
um you have to find somehow a price for

833
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,180
the token

834
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,640
okay

835
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,500
the good thing is if it's done

836
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,440
decentralized because decentralized good

837
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,200
more reliable you have more nodes more

838
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,900
validators more intelligence

839
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,040
to

840
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:05,400
not allow simple manipulations

841
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,480
if you have it centralized on one market

842
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,480
you could play with it and manipulate it

843
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,200
if you know how you're doing Trading

844
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,380
so what this attacker did

845
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,040
um

846
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,800
not going into two crazy details on

847
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,920
financial side but basically he had two

848
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,980
accounts account a account B and he had

849
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,180
a simple 10 million US dollars in his

850
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:35,598
pocket

851
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,839
yes I mean how many people have a simple

852
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:43,500
10 uh 10 million years anyway let's

853
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,440
let's uh that that's how it happened

854
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:49,740
so with one account he offered perps

855
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,300
which is basically kind of a short

856
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,280
position if you would

857
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,359
uh

858
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:58,680
uh compare it to regular stock trading

859
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,579
and with his account B he bought this

860
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:05,240
purse which is basically like a

861
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,220
time-based contract

862
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,220
um that you pay this agreed amount of

863
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,880
money uh to that owner of the short and

864
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,780
stuff

865
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,460
um and everybody's

866
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,420
seeks to get his share out

867
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,700
but I count a and account B was from the

868
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,400
same person that's the basic here

869
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
so there were trading on a very low

870
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,320
limit like 0.03 whatever US dollar per

871
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,540
one token so we're talking about

872
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:39,359
millions of tokens

873
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,000
that was done he was throwing in a bit

874
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,980
of more money yeah he was quite a

875
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,099
wealthy guy it seems

876
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,859
and because it was a centralized price

877
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:54,680
Oracle like price finding mechanism

878
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:58,140
and the more money it gets in it gets

879
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:02,400
traded usually changes the value of the

880
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,980
token so what he was doing was putting

881
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,680
so much money and trades into that he

882
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,200
was able due to the centralized price

883
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,560
local Oracle to trade the my uh the

884
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,200
value up to

885
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,040
0.91 US dollars

886
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,460
um

887
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,880
which basically let his account be with

888
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,119
the perps to a value of more than 400

889
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,460
million US Dollars based on that that

890
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,560
was the flow like this centralized price

891
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,060
Oracle sorry he attracted uh just 160

892
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:39,599
million why 160 million that's a good

893
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,160
question

894
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,619
that was basically all the liquidation

895
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:45,599
which was in that market so he

896
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,160
completely killed the liquidation of

897
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,140
that market he sucked out every money

898
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,760
which was on this

899
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,640
mango Market

900
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,920
um and that's done of course you may say

901
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,980
oh yeah well what about this 5 million

902
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,619
uh in account a

903
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:03,660
there was no more liquidation but he

904
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,000
already made out of bit more than 10

905
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,140
million

906
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:10,020
more than 100 million so basically

907
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,420
there's 60 million you can say like yeah

908
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,460
that was his investment so he got that

909
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,339
claim back uh with the benefit of a

910
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:20,640
hundred that's a nice deal I mean we're

911
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,520
talking about a few minutes here

912
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,940
like that did not happen about hours or

913
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,839
days

914
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,060
that's a few minutes

915
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,320
minutes

916
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,720
like if you go and get a coffee and get

917
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,859
back this already happened

918
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:44,460
that's the tricky thing and if you just

919
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,740
combine this that's also what happened

920
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,320
at some attacks

921
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,660
um this price Oracle attack was like the

922
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,140
central price oracles with a flash uh

923
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,900
loan like you even don't have to invest

924
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,079
a lot of money yourself you just get a

925
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,880
loan

926
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,440
of course you have to pay back the

927
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,640
interest

928
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:07,440
of course

929
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,079
but if you go into any these kind of

930
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:12,240
schemes and you make like out of

931
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,040
10 million more than 100 million I think

932
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,480
paying back the initial loan and a bit

933
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,780
of interest is like not

934
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,619
the big thing right

935
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,839
but they're good news

936
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,079
it's not all bad

937
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:33,540
um the good news is that

938
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,560
um

939
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,720
there are

940
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,720
successful

941
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,780
investigations and arrests from the

942
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,940
crime and law enforcement agencies

943
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,920
um just a few examples because I think

944
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,560
that's important to know it's not

945
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,619
just things happening and

946
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:59,640
yeah they just get away with that

947
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,760
um we had this arrest I think that was

948
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,700
already beginning of this year January

949
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,520
2023

950
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,500
um were

951
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:14,660
um was mostly the French police

952
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:18,300
arrested the founder of one kind of

953
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,700
malicious crypto exchange which was also

954
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,440
involved into a lot of

955
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:24,980
um crypto fraud schemes

956
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:27,300
because of

957
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,819
I mean that's natural like people

958
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:33,540
stealing crypto or doing anything bad in

959
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,680
crypto

960
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:37,020
at some point they need to cash it out

961
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,900
right so you need to have some exchanges

962
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,280
to

963
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,839
convert the crypto back into dollar

964
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:49,400
stress francs Euros whatever

965
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,940
um

966
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,160
another and that was also interesting

967
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,920
because we were just talking about D5

968
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,780
exploits

969
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:59,819
um that was end of February so not long

970
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:03,660
ago that the French police arrested uh

971
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:06,780
one who is allegedly associated with

972
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,260
also one big exploiting of D5 protocol

973
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:13,260
that was Avalanche

974
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,000
um so also big success there very good

975
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,660
and

976
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:19,920
um I guess

977
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,040
that was kind of known

978
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,819
um that also suspect of the tornado

979
00:45:26,819 --> 00:45:27,780
um

980
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:32,640
uh crypto clean washing servers kind of

981
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:34,319
thing

982
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,200
was also arrested

983
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,420
um it's a mixer basically where

984
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:42,720
criminals put on money like crypto and

985
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,099
this mixer tries to hide the origin

986
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,619
of the owner and sends it to a lot of

987
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,240
other addresses and then the other

988
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,359
addresses are clean washed freshly new

989
00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:56,760
ones nice and then the criminals can

990
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,980
take that crypto and exchange it back

991
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,040
into real money whatever on exchanges

992
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:06,180
because it's not directly linked to the

993
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,780
initial criminal wallet address

994
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:12,180
because we we remember

995
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:15,180
the blockchain stores transactions

996
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:19,260
so you know where in fund was going in

997
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,000
most of the blockchains like ethereum

998
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,880
for example and that was an ethereum

999
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,079
mixer

1000
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:27,480
so you can trace all of that and then

1001
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,040
you have this mixer

1002
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,819
money gets in it's a contract basically

1003
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:35,579
contract again D5

1004
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:38,819
and this contract sends it to a lot of

1005
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:41,819
like it distributes it to a lot of other

1006
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:44,400
addresses so you cannot say like yeah

1007
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,460
where is what money going and if you mix

1008
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:49,319
all of that not only with criminal

1009
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:51,660
activities but also regular users who

1010
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,280
just want to protect their privacy and

1011
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,980
stuff like that how can you identify who

1012
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,800
who is now the real owner of that

1013
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,060
address where

1014
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,140
100 ethereum is it from that

1015
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,599
Ransom operator trying to mix like a

1016
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,520
thousand ethereum or is it from that

1017
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,500
small person who invested like 10

1018
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,480
ethereum in order to

1019
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,540
spice up his life and buy a new car or

1020
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:18,740
whatever kind of stuff

1021
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,700
um

1022
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,160
and

1023
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,140
this also came out

1024
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,599
which links again back to

1025
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:29,940
kind of earlier

1026
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,300
um that the US Department put three

1027
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,880
suspects of uh

1028
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,440
the

1029
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,880
um yeah North Korean military hackers

1030
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:46,880
regarding Lazarus on their wanted list

1031
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:50,700
yes

1032
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,800
we talked a lot about Lazarus right but

1033
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,900
it's interesting

1034
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,579
so

1035
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:59,220
what can you do

1036
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,240
good so first

1037
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:05,520
that's already mentioned Hardware

1038
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,619
wallets

1039
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,520
yes it's a good advice to not leave your

1040
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,319
crypto at an exchange because

1041
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,780
centralized exchanges we've seen it with

1042
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:19,079
FTX they can go down right

1043
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:21,359
people can try to get your credentials

1044
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,240
like phishing scam whatever fake apps to

1045
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,440
get into your account same thing

1046
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,560
crypto if you have and you are the owner

1047
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,240
of your own keys

1048
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,500
it's good

1049
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,780
Hardware wallet makes it a bit nicer

1050
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:39,300
because it's not on your computer so it

1051
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,339
cannot be directly stolen there are many

1052
00:48:41,339 --> 00:48:43,740
Stealers trying to get the wallet that

1053
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,839
for example from software wallets

1054
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,819
installed on a computer

1055
00:48:47,819 --> 00:48:50,520
and if you can correct it then he's the

1056
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,160
owner of the funds right cannot happen

1057
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:56,579
with Hardware wallet if you are not

1058
00:48:56,579 --> 00:48:59,180
tricked

1059
00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:02,819
update your stuff important and check

1060
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:04,260
your software what you installed

1061
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,140
especially don't trust third parties and

1062
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,960
check what wallets you have running if

1063
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,060
you have metamask in your browser check

1064
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:15,119
that it's a valid thing

1065
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:15,780
um

1066
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,720
and yeah scam

1067
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,140
there are many many Evolutions going on

1068
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,920
into that as feared based also on AI

1069
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,920
probably everybody heard about these uh

1070
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:31,800
voice band thingies

1071
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,900
um fake videos and stuff like that so a

1072
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:34,859
lot of

1073
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:37,619
options are going on here in terms of

1074
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,119
tricking people

1075
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,680
be aware of that

1076
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,560
um

1077
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:49,140
we are already

1078
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:51,900
more than 50 minutes

1079
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,780
um as you see it

1080
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:57,180
we just tipped

1081
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,940
the peak of the things

1082
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:03,240
it's a Baseline I just tried to give a

1083
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,160
first overview if we were digging into

1084
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,980
each of these things we would sit here

1085
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,380
probably for a few weeks

1086
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,300
we can do that but

1087
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,520
I mean tomorrow's weekend so I want to

1088
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,740
go home you know

1089
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,060
um

1090
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:20,579
but at least it's something to

1091
00:50:20,579 --> 00:50:21,500
understand

1092
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,319
threats are not only on the user side as

1093
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:28,500
most of us are familiar with

1094
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,180
especially when we're talking about

1095
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,119
crypto D5 stuff

1096
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,780
there is this layer you have nearly no

1097
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:41,099
control about and if you're running on a

1098
00:50:41,099 --> 00:50:43,380
contract you're using any kind of these

1099
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:45,839
things and there is a flaw in

1100
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,359
your fans are addressed at risk as well

1101
00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:50,220
so check

1102
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,559
if it's valid

1103
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,540
try to check if there are source code

1104
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:58,020
reviews stuff like that

1105
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,500
that's the only thing what you can do

1106
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,260
may sound complicated

1107
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,720
but I think we're getting there right

1108
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:08,880
by the way how many people here own

1109
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,460
crypto or interested in owning crypto

1110
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,900
sorry I need to ask this question

1111
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,780
very good

1112
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,760
order

1113
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,660
[Laughter]

1114
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,660
okay thanks uh I'm here a bit longer for

1115
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:30,119
a few questions if you have any else

1116
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:32,640
there is my Twitter Handler uh I can

1117
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,640
share my slides open for discussions if

1118
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,819
there's anything let's talk thanks then

1119
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,270
and throughout the rest of the day

1120
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:44,710
[Applause]
