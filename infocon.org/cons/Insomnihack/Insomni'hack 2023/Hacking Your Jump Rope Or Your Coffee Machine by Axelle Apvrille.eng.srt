1
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:08,820
thank you so my name is Excel I work for

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:11,940
uh fortunate and I work mainly on uh

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,179
Andrews malware and connected objects

4
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,100
and today it's going to be mostly on

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,320
connected objects

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,680
um I'm also the lead organizer of a

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,740
phone CTF which is a CTF in the south of

8
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:28,199
France and which is dedicated to

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,939
Connected objects

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:32,820
and last but not least

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,120
um I'll be talking to you today about a

12
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,500
smart coffee maker machine I don't drink

13
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,680
coffee so during all my research my

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,600
colleagues had to drink the coffee I was

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,660
brewing for that so thanks to them

16
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,579
so those are the two devices we are

17
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,600
going to discuss today you've got on the

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,399
left hand side the coffee machine which

19
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,459
is connected all in both devices are

20
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:08,280
Bluetooth low energy devices connected

21
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,299
that way

22
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:10,979
and on the other side you've got the

23
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:13,680
jump rope we'll be discussing both

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,920
both have been integrated in challenges

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,500
for phone the coffee machine it was in

26
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,880
2019 and the jump rope it was uh in 2022

27
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:29,280
in November in December sorry uh 2022.

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,240
so let's start with the coffee machine

29
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,820
well um actually it's really interesting

30
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,020
because

31
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,920
um well

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,540
I'll discuss actually that a little bit

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,200
later but you can hack in three

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,140
different points you can hack on the

35
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,340
hardware

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,079
in the communication

37
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,520
and on the smartphone okay so

38
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,680
um let's start a little bit but

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,380
um with Hardware reconnaissance in there

40
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,299
I opened the coffee machine and this is

41
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:01,979
what you see you see the buttons on the

42
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:06,600
top okay and this is the back of it

43
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,780
um with something also all the all the

44
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,140
mechanisms which control the flow of of

45
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,220
the coffee

46
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,640
and if you go beneath uh the buttons

47
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,580
well you've got a PCB and if you have a

48
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:25,440
look at what is written on the top right

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,620
um well basically you get some numbers

50
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,140
and basically it says also I think that

51
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,720
it's a waterproof one part of it and the

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,180
other part is helpful to find it on the

53
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,260
net

54
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,560
and you can find the separate part for

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,379
it sold on eBay which is pretty cool

56
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,959
because it means that if your coffee

57
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:48,239
machine has an issue well you can repair

58
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,379
it

59
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,500
um it's something like 35 Euros uh

60
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,599
depending or so this was this one I

61
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,420
think is from eBay in Italy

62
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,760
um but yeah it depends I also some it

63
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,879
was so one in Australia I think

64
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,099
and the other thing that you see in eBay

65
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,940
is that actually this PCB also works for

66
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,580
lots of different coffee machines so

67
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,099
probably they well it's suppositional

68
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,319
I'm not I'm not entirely sure of that

69
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,519
but

70
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,159
um probably it was sub constructed to a

71
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,640
company who then sold it to to multiples

72
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,420
uh coffee makers different bronze and it

73
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:30,480
works for all of these

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,060
if you have a look at the hardware

75
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,720
components on there well you see an STM

76
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,019
chip which is a nadbit microcontroller

77
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,720
and more interesting to me the other

78
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,860
chip there is uh the ble chip so

79
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,220
actually if you've got good eyes you can

80
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,879
see on the the stamp on it that you've

81
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,540
got the FCC ID you can go to the fcc.io

82
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,060
website and look for that and you get

83
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,340
all the details exactly what chip this

84
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,980
is and all the specs which are there so

85
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,018
this is pretty pretty interesting

86
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,120
um and then the other thing which is

87
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,680
really interesting when you're trying to

88
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,420
hack a device I think is do you have a

89
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,358
look at the documentation that is if you

90
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,738
were lucky enough do you have some

91
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:22,979
documentation and for the smart uh

92
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,340
coffee machine there is very good

93
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:28,080
documentation there and in the

94
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,020
instruction manual in particular you can

95
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,840
see the reset to factory settings now

96
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,960
this is really really important to to to

97
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,000
have as an information when you're

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,520
trying to hack something I had to of

99
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,639
course use it several times so this is

100
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,560
really interesting information for

101
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,800
instance

102
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,240
um more information this time in the

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,560
service manual

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,340
um this is awesome I wish that all

105
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,780
manufacturers were providing such good

106
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,540
documentation honestly look at this I

107
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,100
mean this is wonderful you've got

108
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,960
everything you need to repair it um

109
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,960
besides my uh work I'm actually working

110
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,660
at a repair Cafe down in nice and the

111
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,000
south of France and if I had all this

112
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
documentation for all the things I'm

113
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,820
trying to repair it would be really

114
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,199
great and that okay this is good

115
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,000
so what have we learned well we've

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,139
learned that

117
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,220
um the the coffee machine has a BLT chip

118
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,680
it's not a great deal we already knew

119
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,800
that okay but well okay we know that the

120
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,220
PCB is used for many different coffee

121
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,720
machines probably

122
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,360
we know how to reset to factory settings

123
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,940
so this is going to prove out to be very

124
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,479
useful and we know probably or at least

125
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:47,520
better how to repair the coffee machine

126
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,258
and this is really awesome

127
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,800
um if you are more skilled than I am in

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,479
Hardware if you have for instance well

129
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,220
uh the corresponding to the the previous

130
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,680
um Talk of Thomas well if you have his

131
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,320
skills in Hardware you can probably dig

132
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,360
in more much more on the hardware part

133
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,060
and find many more things those are not

134
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,120
my skills okay so if you are like me

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,120
like I am uh not skilled in that part

136
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,660
well you have more than your eyes to cry

137
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,220
you can do something something else

138
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,680
still is well you can hack for instance

139
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,800
in the ble communication

140
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,160
so there we can try and sniff the

141
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,060
Bluetooth communication

142
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,139
um there are basically two different

143
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:40,020
tools that I know of both are really old

144
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:44,520
it's Uber tooth and Adafruit

145
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,280
I think that Uber tooth was presented I

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,819
think in 2011 so it's pretty old more

147
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,039
than 10 years old but it's still

148
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,520
maintained and you can use them use it

149
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,620
like the other one

150
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,199
um to sniff the Bluetooth communication

151
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,819
um it's it works very well and you get

152
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:07,680
all the package which is a little bit

153
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,259
more than we really need because in this

154
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,240
particular case we are only interested

155
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,539
in one part one specific layer of

156
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,259
Bluetooth which is at the at protocol

157
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:22,020
the other issue is that um I'm not

158
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,300
actually that much at ease with those

159
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,099
sniffers

160
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,860
um I know how to use them but I tend to

161
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,720
forget all the time how I have to set

162
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
them up again it's a little bit

163
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,080
complicated you've got to flash the the

164
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,300
firmware then you've got to patch your

165
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,759
wire shark then you know all that stuff

166
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:41,340
it's doable but um I probably don't do

167
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:44,880
it often enough uh to to be really at

168
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,099
ease with it

169
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,880
so the first two parts well it's not the

170
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,160
easiest in my humble opinion or not for

171
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,300
me at least

172
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,340
of course it's the last one okay I'm

173
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,960
going to do everything from their

174
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,220
smartphone

175
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,599
and

176
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,240
um you're going to see that actually we

177
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,099
can find lots of information from the

178
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,800
smartphone and it proves out sometimes

179
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,440
to be extremely easy and handy to use

180
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,860
that way

181
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,900
so um one of the first things you have

182
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,780
to do when you are dealing with a ble

183
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,020
device is to list all the services and

184
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,000
characteristics of the device that's the

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,220
way ble is organized we're not going to

186
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,780
get into the specifics but basically

187
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,240
you've got services and in there you've

188
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,740
got characteristics which are kind of

189
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,940
empty points you can read or write to

190
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,539
if you want to list that you've got

191
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,700
smartphone applications like NRF connect

192
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,560
you've got others but they they sorry

193
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,420
they give a very good uh results are

194
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,800
there if you want to do it from your

195
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,920
laptop it also is possible uh for

196
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,140
instance I'd recommend like a cat tool

197
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,519
well it's deprecated it's been

198
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,459
deprecated for years but I know that uh

199
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,860
some of us are still using it uh very

200
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,660
much because it's really it's simple to

201
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:07,260
use and very convenient its replacement

202
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,540
is actually Bluetooth control which is

203
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,640
also excellent as well perhaps a little

204
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,519
bit more verbos it talks a lot it's a

205
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:16,980
bit too talkative let's say okay but it

206
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,260
works so you can get the lists of

207
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,779
exactly this which is all the services

208
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:24,120
that you have on your device

209
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,120
so on the smart coffee machine you've

210
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,260
got standard Services generic access

211
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,420
generic attribute and then all the the

212
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,160
other ones are specific to the coffee

213
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,600
machine

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,700
and here in this case we always say we

215
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,260
can see that the developers really kind

216
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,080
of organized the various characteristics

217
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:46,680
and uh in a thoughtful way like you know

218
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,120
you've got the errors at some point

219
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,120
things that users can

220
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,000
uh can customize in another and things

221
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,040
like that we're going to discuss those a

222
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,880
little bit more afterwards

223
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
then what we want to do of course

224
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,839
obviously is to connect to the coffee

225
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,300
machine first thing that happens you try

226
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,420
to connect and it spits out uh an error

227
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,279
telling you well it requires

228
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,060
authentication before read and write

229
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:18,440
so there you can go and have a look at

230
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,320
how security modes are defined in ble

231
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,120
and you'll see there is level one two

232
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,160
and three basically what you need is

233
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,980
level three which is authenticated

234
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,100
encryption and which is actually pairing

235
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,800
okay it's kind of the same so if you

236
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,200
want to get this well you use get tool

237
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,480
get tool you've got to say that security

238
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,580
level here

239
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,640
is high because that's what means

240
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,680
actually level three moderate I think is

241
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,839
two and low is one something like that

242
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,120
and if you're using Bluetooth control

243
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,279
it's I think a little bit more intuitive

244
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,200
there because while you just say that

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,740
you want to pair to a given device and

246
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,140
you get the pairing

247
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,300
then you try again to connect

248
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,860
and

249
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,779
um you think it's going to work and no

250
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,880
not exactly it tells you this time

251
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
attribute requires authorization before

252
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,660
read write so

253
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,820
um the first time I got the error uh I

254
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,440
read too quickly I thought it was

255
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,240
authentication and I thought damn my

256
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,480
pairing didn't work work uh it did it's

257
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,459
not that it's different authentication

258
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,120
authorization totally different okay

259
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,779
now this is a really rare in ble devices

260
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:33,240
it was the first

261
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,100
um coffee machine well smart coffee

262
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,800
machine smart uh first ble device

263
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,920
actually in the end that I saw with um

264
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,860
authorization at all okay so it was

265
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,899
particularly interesting to me to deal

266
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,579
with that because I hadn't ever seen

267
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:48,740
that

268
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,600
it's totally implemented by the device

269
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,720
itself this is not part of well

270
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,140
the bluetooth specs say that it's up to

271
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,760
the device to implement the

272
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,339
authorization the way they want sorry

273
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,720
for this but

274
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:07,140
I'm going to move it a little bit yeah

275
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,760
so how do I get authors authorized

276
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,459
so this is where I'm going to sniff

277
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,800
uh the communication but I'm not going

278
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,899
to sniff using Uber truth or something

279
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,060
else I'm going to sniff directly on the

280
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,019
smartphone

281
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:24,600
if you've got a rooted device well you

282
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,700
can actually on Android pretty easily

283
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,100
enable uh Bluetooth

284
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,660
um snooping

285
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,519
um it's really not difficult to do it's

286
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,680
like you click on various menus and it

287
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,980
works and then you get the pcap on the

288
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,200
smartphone directly you transfer that

289
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,720
and you put it in Wireshark and well I'm

290
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,380
happy okay

291
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,579
and you get that

292
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,079
so

293
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,060
well maybe at the back you can't exactly

294
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,360
read but those are just a list of

295
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,820
enumeration packets in there so it's

296
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,040
kind of enumerating all the services and

297
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,740
all the characteristics okay

298
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,980
then you get a read request on handle

299
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,300
16.

300
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,279
okay

301
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,100
then you get a write request on handle

302
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,680
14. now

303
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,860
um if you want to get authorized

304
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,959
obviously you're going to have to write

305
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,380
something okay so I thought okay uh one

306
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,820
way or another

307
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,740
um the right request is going to be

308
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,260
really interesting to me because

309
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,540
possibly this is what is going to give

310
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,120
the authorization code and prove that I

311
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,420
am somebody to be trusted okay or well

312
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,459
or that I am this uh this authorized

313
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:41,100
person and indeed it is that so in the

314
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,800
packet in here we have the authorization

315
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,760
code

316
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,339
to be sent to the smart to the smart

317
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,700
coffee machine okay now it uses just to

318
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,100
take a screenshot of that one because it

319
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,279
is changing every time uh we are

320
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,360
repairing to the device so you've got to

321
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,300
uh get this code by yourselves by doing

322
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:06,000
the the by sniffing the communication

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,040
then you get it and then you are

324
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,560
authorized for the rest of um the the

325
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,260
long possibly long session

326
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,060
and by the way

327
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,399
um normally we'll have the smart coffee

328
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,060
machine uh at fortinet's Booth uh today

329
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,339
so if you want to try and hack and get

330
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,200
your your coffee that way well you can

331
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,760
you're you're welcome to try and hack

332
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,779
the machine

333
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,300
then in phone what happened is that one

334
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,639
of the challenges was that we wanted

335
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,860
um the hackers

336
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:41,100
to um to get a 90 milliliter cup okay

337
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,480
normally ristretto is 25 milliliters

338
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,480
espresso is 40 Milli milliliters you see

339
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,800
I've learned quite a lot about coffee

340
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,060
now okay and Longo is 110 milliliters

341
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,480
okay so um you can cheat but you're not

342
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,120
supposed to you can do two risk pretors

343
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,279
and one espresso that will be also 90

344
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,260
milliliters but you were supposed to get

345
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,620
that in one cup not in three cups

346
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,399
okay so we're going to try and do this

347
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,040
so here we go in the code of the Android

348
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,500
application which is uh supposed to

349
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:20,760
control the coffee machine and we see

350
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,639
um a class which is named cup size

351
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,579
volume and this looks like you know a

352
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:29,339
good a good place to to look into and

353
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,680
you see the different ranges which are

354
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,680
acceptable for ristretto espresso and

355
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,540
lungo so if we want 90 milliliters well

356
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,880
it works for lungo it won't work for

357
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,399
ristretto and espresso because it's not

358
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,240
beyond the range okay cool

359
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,480
and now how are we going to do to to set

360
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,540
this well uh we have a look at another

361
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,980
class which is called cup size

362
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:58,740
operations the name isn't obfuscated in

363
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,220
the code so this is Handy uh and you see

364
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,680
that there's a service in the service is

365
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,660
user options and then you've got two

366
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,399
different characteristics

367
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,760
cup size and cup volume so what we'll

368
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,040
have to do is to specify we want to hack

369
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,880
lungo cup size and cut volume or 90

370
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,600
milliliters

371
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,320
now a small note there is that it's it's

372
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,459
um handy

373
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:30,300
to work on handles okay but sometimes

374
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,540
you have only the universal identifier

375
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,639
which is there so if you want to make

376
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:38,279
the matching and know what is the handle

377
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,259
well actually Bluetooth control gives

378
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:43,560
you both this is the uuid and this is

379
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,480
the handle in here and this is the

380
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,120
address of the MAC address so it's an

381
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,519
easy way if you want to work with either

382
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:53,339
well you have both information uh which

383
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,699
is cool

384
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:59,519
so cup size so it's a specific protocol

385
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,220
well a specific package format so sorry

386
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,799
but it's really extremely easy it's only

387
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,160
two bytes and for Longo well you just

388
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,859
have to specify number two and

389
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:12,020
um it will

390
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,599
customize logo cool

391
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,939
cup volume it's slightly more

392
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:19,679
complicated so it's still not very

393
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,199
complicated it's four bytes actually the

394
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,679
two for the two first ones is

395
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,020
um the volume and milliliters and the

396
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,780
last two are fixed always FFF

397
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,120
okay so we know

398
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,780
sorry I'll come back oops uh we know how

399
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,780
to uh specify the cup that we want to

400
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,660
customize and we know how to specify the

401
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,600
number of milliliters now we've got to

402
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,000
be able also to tell the coffee machine

403
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,480
okay to me my my coffee okay

404
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,000
and um here I'm skipping a little bit of

405
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,799
Parts because well we don't have like a

406
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,280
two hour session but um uh in the code

407
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,900
you see again that there's another

408
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,320
command with a specific header okay

409
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,179
which basically would tell the coffee

410
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,000
machine to brew a coffee and then you

411
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,280
specify the delay when do you want your

412
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,840
coffee do you want it tomorrow morning

413
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,880
or do you want it just now

414
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,460
and what type of coffee you want well

415
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,280
what uh what type of cup

416
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,400
so here for instance if we want our 90

417
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,280
milliliters cup of copy we'll say that

418
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,039
we want it now so the delay will be new

419
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,260
and the coffee type is going to be Longo

420
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,480
so it's going to be zero zero zero two

421
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,760
and um you send this command well with

422
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,100
to this given service which is here and

423
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,960
the characteristics to send it to are

424
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,120
written there so it's the Brew key and

425
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,159
here handle 24.

426
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,980
now um just a summary so if we want to

427
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,620
finally get our cup of coffee we've got

428
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:01,919
to pair to authorize to get well the

429
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,700
authorization code to customize the say

430
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,600
that we want to customize the lungo cup

431
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,820
um customize the volume 90 milliliters

432
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,120
and then tell it to brew uh the cup of

433
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,559
coffee

434
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,760
and

435
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
um this is where I'm gonna show you well

436
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,960
actually a video because uh I didn't

437
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,260
dare to bring the coffee machine

438
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,760
um just here

439
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,440
uh so it's this one

440
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,640
so on the left hand side you've got the

441
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,200
script and on the other one well you've

442
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,660
got the coffee machine and you see that

443
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,940
on the cup of coffee I have marks wrist

444
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:45,419
or E for espresso and the The Higher One

445
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:49,020
is a lungo and if I managed to get so

446
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,640
well if we get to the 90 milliliters

447
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,640
it's going to stop just below those the

448
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,100
longer which is 110.

449
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,960
so this is normally

450
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,360
90 milliliters approximately

451
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,520
[Music]

452
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,200
and by the way that's some that's what

453
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,640
some participants had to do to uh to uh

454
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,640
flag the challenge so that was a cool

455
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,100
that some of them did

456
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,760
so uh resuming

457
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,799
you can do actually more but that that

458
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,799
wasn't part of the CTF I mean this

459
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,260
coffee machine is amazing I love it

460
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:33,480
um you can do actually a recipe so you

461
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,940
can say I want a little bit of water

462
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:38,640
this volume then I want a little bit of

463
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,260
coffee then I wanted again a little bit

464
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:42,059
of water and you can build up your

465
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,860
recipe you can tell the temperature you

466
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,220
want it and then you can create a recipe

467
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,460
for that give it an ID and uh it will do

468
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,440
it just the way you like it because

469
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,820
that's another thing I've learned from

470
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,100
my colleagues is that nobody likes the

471
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,980
same coffee okay so okay

472
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,280
foreign

473
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,140
you can do much more and uh this is

474
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,880
where if you want to play afterwards

475
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,980
with a coffee machine I I suggest that

476
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,140
you take a screenshot of this one

477
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,140
because you can do much more you can get

478
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,539
for instance uh the control the coffee

479
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,419
machine will tell you for instance if

480
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,400
it's missing water so you've got all the

481
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,620
responses like that and you can get that

482
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:26,220
you can also set up a water hardness and

483
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:28,980
say if uh if it needs to be adjusted or

484
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,960
not

485
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,299
um there's even a ble command if you

486
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:35,280
want to do a factory reset okay so

487
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,960
plenty of other things that you can do

488
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,179
and if you feel like it well you have

489
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,760
some more technical information in that

490
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,120
document

491
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:48,000
one of the issues I thought is that also

492
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,840
um

493
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,240
um well this coffee machine is a bit

494
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,940
strange but the designer only thought

495
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,100
that one person would connect to it

496
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,280
because you can only be paired well it's

497
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,679
only possible to pair one person at a

498
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,679
given time which means that if I don't

499
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:06,960
know colleague a is paired well

500
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
colleague B is going to have to unpair

501
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,860
colleague a

502
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,559
pair again and talk to the machine I

503
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,900
mean this is never going to happen and

504
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,240
uh I'm sure you've all struggled with

505
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,720
ble pairing before uh it's a nightmare

506
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,179
um so really this is not really very

507
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:25,919
practical so I thought

508
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,620
um how can we make this available to all

509
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,720
colleagues okay

510
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,120
um in a more efficient manner

511
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,460
well simple you can just use a Raspberry

512
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:39,299
Pi and it will act as a ble relay okay

513
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:41,520
so I connected it to the Bluetooth

514
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,760
machine and then I built um well a basic

515
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,960
web interface which was uh they the my

516
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,900
colleagues would go to and uh say

517
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,780
remotely I would like my coffee I

518
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,299
wouldn't like it here where's petro and

519
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:58,340
things like that

520
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:01,260
and that's also something I've got a

521
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,360
short demo for

522
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,120
I don't have though the happy face of my

523
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,980
colleagues there to show

524
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,820
but there well my this is uh my web

525
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,640
interface it's not very nice but um I'm

526
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,140
not very good at this design that way

527
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,960
and there you push a button and you get

528
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,020
your coffee and I even implemented the

529
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,600
error feedback so if coffee is missing

530
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,100
it's going to complain and tell them

531
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,480
well yeah okay you want coffee but

532
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,640
there's no coffee okay

533
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,200
um so that's the way it works

534
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,580
so

535
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,600
um

536
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,740
this is sorry this is available also on

537
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,039
on GitHub if ever you've got the same uh

538
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,039
or a matching coffee machine you can get

539
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,860
it from here and um happily you will be

540
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,080
able to get your coffee over Wi-Fi

541
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,918
instead of ble

542
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,360
we're done with uh the smart coffee

543
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,580
machine now we're gonna do a little bit

544
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,460
of fitness with a jump rope

545
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,340
um it's basically the same because it's

546
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,020
still a Bluetooth low energy device

547
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:10,860
um just the same well as you can imagine

548
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,200
uh you can hack it on the hardware Port

549
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,240
or on the communication part but you

550
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,620
already know that I'm gonna do

551
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,418
everything here from the smartphone

552
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:24,659
um so actually

553
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:26,100
um that's something that Thomas

554
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,460
mentioned uh at some point in one of his

555
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,880
slides is that yeah do not forget to

556
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,400
have a look at the system logs of

557
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,140
Android because you can find sometimes

558
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,960
really valuable information and here it

559
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,179
turns out that actually the application

560
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,419
is logging everything that you want on

561
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,940
the the Android system logs including

562
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,820
Bluetooth packets so I'm going to show

563
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,720
that

564
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,900
and this is going to be a live demo so

565
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,480
enjoy

566
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,520
uh I'm not I hopefully I will enjoy it

567
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,840
as much

568
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,960
it might not work never know so

569
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,880
screen copy

570
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,020
I'm gonna show you

571
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,860
um

572
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,879
my smartphone

573
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,120
so there we go

574
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,059
smart

575
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,520
and now

576
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,580
the lugs and the log out so it's logging

577
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,419
everything with the tag uh with the

578
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,900
section tag in there okay

579
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,640
so I can start this I'm going to connect

580
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,140
the smart jump

581
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,779
oh

582
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:56,400
yep

583
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,159
it's working great

584
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,020
yeah I understood there we go and it

585
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,840
as disconnected so this is Bluetooth

586
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,679
there we go

587
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,880
okay so this is

588
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,140
um all the logs that you get I don't

589
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,039
even need to jump at all come and do it

590
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,860
because you'll see actually

591
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,000
let you get more ones

592
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,180
[Applause]

593
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,700
yeah sorry

594
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,600
so you get it here

595
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,179
so

596
00:26:57,179 --> 00:26:59,460
actually if you have a look at in there

597
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,179
in the

598
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,620
in the logs

599
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,900
well we'll see some of them but I'm

600
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,659
looking for

601
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,299
um by the way this is each time I was

602
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,159
jumping it tells you

603
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,100
lots of things so that was probably the

604
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,120
sixth jump

605
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,440
uh

606
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,799
uh and battery is 100 looks like okay

607
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,279
not sure of that though

608
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,440
um I'm looking for one specific log

609
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,679
yeah this one oops where this one here

610
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:40,500
this is exactly the raw packet which is

611
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,679
sent uh by bluetooth okay so this is

612
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,200
pretty interesting uh there because it

613
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,140
will help you afterwards understand

614
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,659
uh how to deal with and communicate with

615
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,620
the jump rope

616
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,240
so there you've got it

617
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,520
um as you've seen

618
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,380
well I don't know maybe you speak fluent

619
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,940
Chinese but I don't but my main

620
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,279
difficulty was there uh that you just

621
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,140
have to translate it

622
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,480
um but once you translate it it's okay

623
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,200
uh it's really relatively clear you've

624
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,919
got

625
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,320
um well battery data here the battery

626
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,919
level in that case was 70. uh here this

627
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,080
exactly translates to buy there is a

628
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,940
buzzer you'll see afterwards but it has

629
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,340
a buzzer and it will it can make a

630
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,779
little bit of noise

631
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,320
so it helps very much to continue the

632
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,059
reverse engineering because well you

633
00:28:33,059 --> 00:28:35,039
basically go in the code and you're

634
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,440
gonna copy those Chinese characters to

635
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
search and then the code and for

636
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,600
instance well here I end up in a method

637
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,460
which is called update battery and which

638
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,520
was quite logical I was uh it was saying

639
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,200
something about battery level so this is

640
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,080
fine and it tells me that so probably

641
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,360
ble live data is a class I need to

642
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,760
investigate

643
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,179
for the one with uh the Bluetooth row

644
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:03,360
packet so I copied the the characters in

645
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,080
here

646
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,260
and it ends up in a

647
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,960
in a in a method which is named parse

648
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,299
command this is also something that

649
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,279
hackers will love whenever you see parse

650
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,840
commands you know

651
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,299
uh stars in the eyes things like that

652
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:22,220
okay uh blue Le service is another

653
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,659
class which is probably interesting to

654
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,460
to look into

655
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,100
and while you look into that uh it takes

656
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,559
a little bit of time but you will get

657
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,020
the full picture which is understand how

658
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,899
to discuss with the jump rope basically

659
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,580
there are three different modes with

660
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,980
this jump rope uh the number countdown

661
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,779
mode which means that you are going to

662
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:45,240
say I want to jump I don't know 500

663
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,380
times

664
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,860
uh the time countdown mode is I want to

665
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,240
jump five minutes

666
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,640
and then the free jump mode is uh I

667
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,960
don't know what I want to do but just

668
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,840
let me jump okay

669
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,620
so this is the way to uh to uh to send

670
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,939
this command to the jump rope

671
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:10,260
so in uh phone 2022 what people had to

672
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,919
do was to try and initiate a commands

673
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,779
where they would do one thousand and 337

674
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,140
jumps okay so what they had to do is to

675
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,539
connect to the device then

676
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:26,640
um the organization of the jump rope in

677
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,580
terms of services and characteristics

678
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,740
it's much simpler than than their smart

679
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,960
coffee machine there's basically only

680
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,840
one or two important services

681
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,600
and so he gets um easily the

682
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,399
characteristic you can write to because

683
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,860
I think there's only one actually so

684
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,039
there's not lots of choices and then you

685
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,179
send the command that I I said over here

686
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:53,820
which is well some basic thing at the

687
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,740
beginning then you say oh it's number

688
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,960
countdown mode so I'm going to specify a

689
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,480
number of jumps then uh in HEX 539 well

690
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:05,760
that is uh the target number of jumps I

691
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,000
want and the last two are a CRC at

692
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,919
checksum so you just have to figure out

693
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:14,279
that it's crc16 modbus but that's uh the

694
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,279
only difficulty you have to do

695
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,960
okay and yeah I've got another demo

696
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,520
um

697
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,679
yeah

698
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,360
we don't need a phone for this one

699
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,539
so I'm going to show you how to how I

700
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,000
communicate with the

701
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,039
with the jump rope

702
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,320
directly

703
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,620
okay

704
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:50,418
um

705
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:55,340
looks my screen has frozen or what

706
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,440
oh

707
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,399
yeah it's not clicking just trying Okay

708
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,760
so

709
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,418
I'm rebooting sorry for this

710
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,740
you know

711
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:45,360
so I'm going to show you afterwards um a

712
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,299
program

713
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,279
which communicates by ble to the jump

714
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:52,500
rope and we're gonna send uh the

715
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,179
commands of their

716
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:57,659
um to start and jump uh and things like

717
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,159
that okay

718
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,260
um rebooting don't worry it's normal

719
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,640
that you're not seeing anything because

720
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,620
well I unplugged the HDMI cable

721
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,739
um

722
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,840
that looks like that's this is fine well

723
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,940
unfortunately I had set it up and I'll

724
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,980
have to do it again

725
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,019
but

726
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,820
so

727
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,080
um

728
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,720
we go in jump rope directory

729
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,460
me

730
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,860
and I'm going to try oh I need also

731
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,140
uh to show you

732
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,099
my camera okay

733
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,560
so jeez

734
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,780
e

735
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,060
so what happens is that there's a small

736
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,000
LCD screen on the jump rope

737
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,359
and that's what I want

738
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:39,500
to show you

739
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,379
yeah not too bad

740
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,020
some

741
00:34:55,379 --> 00:34:58,260
and I'll put this in there okay

742
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,859
so I'm connected we're gonna do how many

743
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,800
jumps you want

744
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,700
okay 800.

745
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:11,540
it's not working

746
00:35:13,099 --> 00:35:16,820
okay let's do it again

747
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,000
[Music]

748
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,160
okay so I should put it the other way

749
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,280
around so that you see that

750
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,839
perhaps better but you can normally

751
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,940
approximately see that it says 800

752
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,920
yeah sorry for this it's not it's it's

753
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,480
not really

754
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,380
obvious uh now I do not intend to do 800

755
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,280
jumps so we're gonna cancel that

756
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,620
canceling it

757
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,480
[Music]

758
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,660
um then you can try a time Jump and I'm

759
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,460
gonna jump for 400 seconds

760
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,220
and this is uh you see exactly the

761
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:07,859
number count down there

762
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:10,200
um then you know my colleagues were

763
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,540
annoyed with the buzzer so I had to do

764
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,760
something about the buzzer so this is

765
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,640
buzzer off and now let's try it and now

766
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,619
the free jump mode

767
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,140
no sorry I've got to cancel first the

768
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,280
other one

769
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,200
so canceled when it canceled they tell

770
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,540
me I've been I've spent like 22 seconds

771
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,259
doing nothing

772
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:33,540
okay and now I'm gonna try free jump

773
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:35,820
mode and there it tells me well okay go

774
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,520
on but you've done nothing okay I can

775
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,460
cancel that and then because I liked

776
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,220
noise I'm gonna put the buzzer back on

777
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:47,540
you've got the bow okay

778
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:54,660
okay so let's go back to the slides

779
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,500
yeah thanks

780
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,820
[Applause]

781
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,940
I'm happy nobody among the the audience

782
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,800
connected to the jump rope

783
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,220
um

784
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,920
so I'm going back to my slides and

785
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,359
we'll finish up

786
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,000
um yeah this is done now or this is not

787
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,820
totally done for a CTF

788
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,380
because

789
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,780
um how are we going to validate the flag

790
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,960
we want basically the participants to

791
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,240
know how to send the correct commands

792
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,760
but uh in return we've got to give them

793
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,619
a flag so how are we going to validate

794
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:50,640
that

795
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,339
there are various options one of those

796
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:55,500
is well to do

797
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,140
um the manual validation they come they

798
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,180
show us that they are able to trigger

799
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,640
the number of jumps and we give them a

800
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,099
flag in return it always works that's

801
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:09,060
something we can always try oops

802
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,400
um

803
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,740
we have

804
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,079
um also the possibility to have a web

805
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,660
server okay

806
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,480
um and then people would enter on the

807
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:24,119
web server that they know how to do the

808
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,339
number of jumps but it's missing kind of

809
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,619
the ble interaction so I didn't really

810
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:30,119
like that

811
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:32,339
the other thing was well well we're

812
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:35,160
gonna modify the firmware on the on the

813
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,740
jump rope and we will display the flag

814
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:40,260
but unfortunately as you might have seen

815
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,560
it's really only uh four digit uh LCD so

816
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,760
I don't think it's possible to display

817
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,040
the flag uh in there okay it would have

818
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,619
been really difficult so I ended up with

819
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:54,839
the last solution is that I would like

820
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,440
to build a fake jump rope which behaves

821
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,260
exactly the same for uh from a ble point

822
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:05,220
of view but just has no rope okay

823
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,980
so I tried that I tried that four weeks

824
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,560
um perhaps even months uh never it was

825
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,300
never working there were there are

826
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,800
plenty of different packages to deal

827
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,020
with ble

828
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,780
um I don't think that maybe I was

829
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,099
unlucky or us but it was never working

830
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:24,780
totally sometimes the packages were

831
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,880
extremely old so I even could not

832
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,740
install them any longer

833
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,740
some other times well it was working to

834
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:34,380
some points but then it was bugging then

835
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,140
probably I added my own bugs also on top

836
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,320
of it so I was like you know um thinking

837
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,859
that maybe I would abandon that and then

838
00:39:42,859 --> 00:39:47,280
I went to another CTF I participated to

839
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,820
which is hardware.io and they were

840
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,040
featured featuring a very nice ble

841
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,560
Challenge and I'm not going to ruin

842
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,880
their challenge

843
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,760
um but I thought yeah that's exactly

844
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,040
what I want to I should be using they

845
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:05,640
they had kind of a server which was like

846
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,480
a small Arduino like board and which was

847
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
doing all the which was acting as the

848
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,820
ble at per referral

849
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,980
so I asked them for the code after the

850
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,380
CTF they shared which was really cool of

851
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,839
them and I had a look and I don't know

852
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,520
why I didn't I hadn't thought about that

853
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,900
but it was really

854
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,240
um easy and straightforward just use the

855
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,859
BL ble

856
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:32,820
um uh from well Arduino esp32

857
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,040
so I bought

858
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,060
um like three different esp32 boards and

859
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,599
started designing the fake jump rope

860
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:44,820
so I reused exactly the same Services

861
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,520
the same characteristics as the real

862
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,800
board so that it really would look like

863
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,280
the real one except that for instance on

864
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,420
the jump rope there is a novel The Air

865
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,520
Service for firmware update well

866
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,099
obviously I don't I have no idea how to

867
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,800
implement that on the fake jump rope and

868
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:08,040
it's useless so I just left it but it

869
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,680
wouldn't do anything uh on the the fake

870
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,460
one

871
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,540
and I added a specific CTF service which

872
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,820
was pretty much recognizable with this

873
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,420
very strange uid that beef and here and

874
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,599
only one characteristic with the flag

875
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:28,680
okay now uh if one of the team manages

876
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,400
to to know how to do the number the

877
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,800
requested number of jumps I don't want

878
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,020
they will get the flag but I don't want

879
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,000
the next team to come in and see the

880
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
flag without having to do anything okay

881
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,520
so to prevent that the solution is of

882
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,520
course to erase the flag between all

883
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,700
teams and what we implemented was a

884
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,119
solution where only one team would be

885
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:56,400
able to connect at a given time and when

886
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,800
they were connecting or disconnecting I

887
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,520
would remove and erase the flag

888
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,480
it worked very well uh we implemented

889
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,160
um three different

890
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,420
um fake ble jump rope servers just to

891
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,640
make sure that you know well bleusb

892
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,140
allele to talk a little bit about that

893
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,640
about that

894
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,579
um we sometimes have bad surprises so

895
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,619
it's always good to have three different

896
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:24,480
items in case

897
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,000
um it is needed

898
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,300
so a little bit of advice and takeaways

899
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,940
from different perspectives

900
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,579
hackers well don't forget to inspect

901
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,339
Android logs from a developer point of

902
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:39,900
view I'm not saying that you should

903
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,180
remove all logs because some are just

904
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,720
very useful but if it's debug logs then

905
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,180
you should think about removing them

906
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:51,240
normally if you're in like you know a

907
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,160
company which is used to produce in code

908
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,200
this is really standard and there are

909
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,940
procedures to make sure that the logs

910
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,460
are removed but here we're talking about

911
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,040
connected objects and I have the feeling

912
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,319
that it's like you know a poor intern

913
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,260
who was affected to developing the stuff

914
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,359
in overnight and sometimes the

915
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,140
development is a little bit crappy

916
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,740
ble connection is always painful that's

917
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,540
um I don't know always the always the

918
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,099
case

919
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,099
um I haven't experienced too many issues

920
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:25,619
with the smart coffee machine except for

921
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:28,200
pairing but with the jump rope there

922
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,020
sometimes I get unwanted disconnections

923
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:33,780
I don't know why but this probably means

924
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,060
from a developer point of view that the

925
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,040
quality of the ble chip is not the same

926
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,680
at both ends okay or the way it is

927
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,020
manufactured in the device is probably

928
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,640
different

929
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,200
um as much as possible if you're a

930
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,900
developer I would recommend not to use

931
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,660
pairing because pairing I managed to do

932
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,339
it but there's no way that my father

933
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,319
would be able to do it I mean it's

934
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:58,319
really complicated okay

935
00:43:58,319 --> 00:43:59,339
um

936
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:02,579
daily notifications is also something I

937
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:04,319
haven't discussed but it was really

938
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,440
useful especially in um for the smart

939
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,819
coffee machine

940
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:11,640
activate all notifications that you can

941
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,140
you will get much more messages and it's

942
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,900
helpful to see the status of what things

943
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,359
are or what is happening

944
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,020
ble encryption that's also another part

945
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,980
um I have hacked pretty quite a few of

946
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,980
different vle devices none of them have

947
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,940
ever used the ble encryption it exists

948
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,119
but nobody uses it so well if you want

949
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,740
to communicate secrets that's a way to

950
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,040
do at least

951
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,200
manuals manuals well yeah they're really

952
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,420
um useful especially to get the reset

953
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,839
procedure

954
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:52,920
uh so

955
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,119
um

956
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:56,040
and you can also get some hints on the

957
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,880
hardware

958
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,800
and from the developer's point of view

959
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,240
well if you want to go green and you

960
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,400
claim you want to go green well the

961
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,819
really good thing to do is to to give

962
00:45:05,819 --> 00:45:09,480
some opportunity to people to repair the

963
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,060
device that you are giving them okay so

964
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,640
I don't know give good manual service

965
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,220
manuals that is really good uh different

966
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,740
parts where to find uh and repair parts

967
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:22,619
if you can't well maybe 3D designs of

968
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:25,079
the parts that you would like that would

969
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,960
be helpful to repair that's good

970
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:32,880
uh hacking so how now let's suppose that

971
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,880
you want to hack a new device after this

972
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,680
uh where should you start well it really

973
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,920
depends what you are good at if you

974
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,359
master the

975
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,420
um the hardware part go and start from

976
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,420
there if you don't uh if you don't and

977
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:49,680
you rather

978
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,079
um are good at Android hacking and

979
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,300
things like that like me well it's

980
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,040
obviously rather in the Android parts

981
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,420
that you should do some reverse

982
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,060
engineering

983
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,040
the other thing also which I think is

984
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,599
interesting to point out from for

985
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,160
developers is that hackers are you're

986
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,660
not your enemies hackers are not

987
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:09,780
attackers all the time and especially in

988
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,460
all the hacks that we've seen so far

989
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,040
well they were all positive hacks

990
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,940
I mean I'm not breaking anything okay

991
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,099
I'm actually making the coffee machine

992
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,859
more usable because it's now usable over

993
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,140
the Wi-Fi and I can get my famous 90

994
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,359
milliliter cup okay it's maybe useless

995
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,880
but it's fun okay

996
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,060
um but yeah it's a useful and we only

997
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,980
hack things that we like to be honest

998
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,079
otherwise it's not so or that we find

999
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:40,040
funny otherwise we wouldn't be doing it

1000
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,079
now this is a little bit more part of my

1001
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:44,160
job

1002
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,960
um I thought of well is it possible to

1003
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,240
infect either of these devices

1004
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,700
fortunately in that case it is not

1005
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:53,760
because there is nothing where we can

1006
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,060
really substance substantially store a

1007
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:58,680
malware it doesn't need lots of space

1008
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,380
and malware a few bytes or at least one

1009
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,960
kilobyte would be sufficient but we

1010
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,520
don't even have that they are really

1011
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,760
limited uh there so this is good but if

1012
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:10,619
you are designing

1013
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,740
um a connected device which is connected

1014
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:16,619
to Internet and has storage even a

1015
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:18,599
little bit of storage really pay

1016
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,119
attention due to this because they might

1017
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,300
get compromised and serve to compromise

1018
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,700
other hosts afterwards so this you need

1019
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,880
really to pay attention to

1020
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,619
and that's all thank you very much for

1021
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:34,099
your attention

1022
00:47:41,579 --> 00:47:43,500
okay so do we have questions we have a

1023
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,300
few minutes at the moment coffees are

1024
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,520
being prepared in the main room and I

1025
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,020
think it's a good idea to keep you here

1026
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:51,119
to not let you go to the coffee machines

1027
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,680
right there

1028
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,980
so let's start there

1029
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,950
wait for the microphone

1030
00:47:58,950 --> 00:48:02,129
[Music]

1031
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,260
um I haven't sent it to Nespresso in

1032
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,400
that case because it wasn't too

1033
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:13,680
vulnerability all right okay so I

1034
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,180
thought that they wouldn't really be

1035
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:16,680
interested

1036
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,599
um however if they want for instance to

1037
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,359
implement on their uh app uh the

1038
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,579
possibility to customize the volume well

1039
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:25,800
they are more than capable capable to do

1040
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,319
it so it would be possible and they can

1041
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,599
go and get it I mean it's um it's public

1042
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:33,839
also for them but yeah so the answer is

1043
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,640
no because I thought it was not a

1044
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,240
vulnerability

1045
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,780
same for the jump rope by the way I

1046
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:48,359
didn't disclose because well it's just

1047
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:50,400
using it another way but

1048
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,960
it's not really vulnerable

1049
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,299
okay thank you Excel
