1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:07,200
good afternoon everybody and uh thank

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,120
you very much for taking the time to

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,860
attend my talk

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,559
uh I titled my presentation this is not

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:15,120
a game

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,980
um and it's about what data tells us

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,080
about whether or not we're doing our

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,880
jobs and by we in this case I mean

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,900
um uh you know Security Consultants

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,160
penetration testers vulnerability

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,140
management Specialists I'm focused on

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,800
that part of the security problem

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,540
and I've been thinking about this

14
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,059
presentation for a long time and I'm not

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,879
actually a hundred percent sure

16
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:44,660
what I want to say which is a problem

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,739
since since I'm standing up here already

18
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:51,539
um but I thought I'll start with a story

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,480
that I always like to tell and it always

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,100
makes me feel comfortable and I think it

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,980
sets a sort of a context it's a it's a

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:02,100
story that comes from Africa I'm a South

23
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,500
African born and and raised I still live

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,400
there now

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,979
and uh you know we're a land of big game

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,439
we have Lions elephants rhinos we can

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,420
see them all the time it's a wonderful

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,640
part of the experience of living there

29
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,560
and there's a story that goes that in

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,640
the morning in Africa when the Sun rises

31
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,880
the Lioness wakes up and she knows that

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,460
she has to run faster than the slowest

33
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,659
antelope

34
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:30,900
in order to have a meal and survive an

35
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,119
antelope like the Springbok and that

36
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,280
thing so the lion knows she has to run

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,680
faster than the slowest Antelope the

38
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,840
antelope wakes up and she knows that she

39
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,320
has to run faster than the fastest Lion

40
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,140
in order not to be eaten and to survive

41
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,479
and so the story goes that in Africa

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,159
when we wake up everybody starts running

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,619
and I I find this a very useful analogy

44
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,840
for security right it's what we do we

45
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,340
wake up and we start running we're

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,560
running away from threats we're running

47
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
towards compliance we're running to

48
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,640
patch vulnerabilities in fact there's a

49
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,399
there's a corollary to that story about

50
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,619
the cameraman who's photographing the

51
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,500
the lion in the bush of Africa and he

52
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,239
sees this two cameramen they see the

53
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,500
lion approaching them in a very

54
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,239
dangerous way and they realize they're

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,640
in trouble so the one line so the one

56
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,440
cameraman reaches down and he takes off

57
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,720
his uh his Bush boots and he starts

58
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,220
putting on some running shoes

59
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,160
and his colleague system but listen what

60
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,780
are you doing you can't run away from a

61
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,480
lion it's too fast and the cameraman

62
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,800
says to his friend no I don't have to

63
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,360
run away from the lion I only have to

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,940
run away from you all right because the

65
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,739
Lion's gonna eat the slowest uh the

66
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:42,840
slowest runner and so we had this idea I

67
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,000
believe in security that we're sort of

68
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,280
running towards something some level of

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,620
compliance some level of benchmarking

70
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,140
some level of best practice and if we

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,760
can do it better than the threat actor

72
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,879
or better than our uh compatriots then

73
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,459
somehow we we outrun the threat

74
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:01,560
the problem is that

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,420
I don't think it actually works like

76
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,879
that I think it's it's much more complex

77
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,220
it's much more like running with the

78
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,379
bulls in Pamplona there's not one lion

79
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,900
that we have to outstrip or one other

80
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,540
Runner uh that we have to go faster than

81
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,640
and if we look at some of the numbers

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,620
around something simple like

83
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,959
vulnerability management we very quickly

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:24,300
see how overwhelming that problem is

85
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,640
Right

86
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,159
cves alone around 18

87
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,879
000 new cves per year our data suggests

88
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,400
that on average across all the hosts

89
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,099
that we do vulnerability assessment on

90
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:40,260
uh there's about you 19 unique findings

91
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,239
that's excluding the informationals and

92
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,959
all the rubbish 19 actionable things

93
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,640
the data suggests that firms are only

94
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
patching between five and ten twenty

95
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,720
percent of known vulnerabilities

96
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,239
and uh and that number gets worse the

97
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,640
bigger your organization gets so you

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,200
would think big organizations with more

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,140
maturity are better at managing their um

100
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,819
vulnerabilities but in fact the opposite

101
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,319
seems to be true the number of

102
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,659
vulnerabilities per host seems to go up

103
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:09,000
and we believe that only around five

104
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,980
percent between two and seven percent of

105
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,620
those 18 000 vulnerabilities will ever

106
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,440
be exploited in the wild so we can't

107
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,298
chase down all these vulnerabilities

108
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:20,639
just like we can't run away from all the

109
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,320
Bulls in Pamplona and the question then

110
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
is how do we choose which of these

111
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,060
vulnerabilities we're going to chase how

112
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,040
do we put our time and effort into

113
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,639
running away from the right thing

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,220
and I think and I've used these two

115
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,960
icons which you'll see coming up again

116
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,600
and again uh the vulnerability scanning

117
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,940
vulnerability assessment functions and

118
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,320
the penetration testing functions

119
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,320
redeeming functions uh have in their

120
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,960
mission the

121
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,740
um the the the responsibility to inform

122
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:55,320
the business and inform it which of

123
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,639
these things should we be running away

124
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
from right but that's not actually a

125
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,800
very simple thing to decide

126
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,419
and then

127
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,060
um I had this experience last year when

128
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,520
I was looking at some of the data that

129
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,139
we produce on from Orange cyber defense

130
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,660
I'll tell you about myself in a moment

131
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,460
um but I looked at three different data

132
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,080
sets the first was I looked at something

133
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,820
called world watch it's a security

134
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,979
advisory service that we published we

135
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:22,800
are very clever people working 24 7 and

136
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,360
they send out these notices to our

137
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,220
clients to say this is what you should

138
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,660
be running away from

139
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,820
today and of course the big thing we

140
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,919
were running away from last year was log

141
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,479
4J right everyone's running away from

142
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,500
log4j in fact we mentioned it in eight

143
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,780
different advisories right we spoke

144
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,780
about it a lot then I looked to see what

145
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,300
are we actually seeing when we scan our

146
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,060
customer States and in fact we do see

147
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,020
log4j but we only saw it on six hosts

148
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,280
incidentally out of forty one thousand

149
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,919
right so it is a big problem but it

150
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,039
actually has a small reach then I look

151
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,199
to see what our penetration testers are

152
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,020
actually exploiting in the wild up in

153
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,419
not in the wild penetration testers and

154
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:07,919
actually we only exploited that

155
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,320
vulnerability once and it made me very

156
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,400
curious about this idea of what we're

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,280
being told we should run away from

158
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,900
compared to what we're really advising

159
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,460
sorry what we really should be running

160
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,319
away from you know where the line really

161
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,539
is compared to what we're telling our

162
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:26,060
clients they should be concerned about

163
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,319
particularly through these scanning and

164
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,720
penetration testing services and that

165
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,580
reminded me oops this doesn't actually

166
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,120
work that reminded me of a presentation

167
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,199
from 2011 44con in London by a guy

168
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,819
called harun Mia some of you may know

169
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,460
him as an old friend of mine we love

170
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,080
each other very much we also argue very

171
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,720
much and harun did this presentation

172
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,240
saying penetration testing is considered

173
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,520
harmful we're actually doing ourselves a

174
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,280
disservice I recommend that you have a

175
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,020
look at it it's a very interesting topic

176
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,020
and I wish I could comment more I

177
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,699
disagreed with him of course in a lot of

178
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,240
things I was a penetration tester myself

179
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,560
but he made one of the points he makes

180
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,960
is that when we do penetration testing

181
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,960
we're not actually emulating what a real

182
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,300
adversary is doing in the wild we're not

183
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,520
acting like the real lion we're just

184
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,020
acting like the other penetration

185
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,240
testers and so all of these ideas sort

186
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,580
of started to Bumble up in my mind and I

187
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,440
I conceived an experiment a thought

188
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,580
experiment

189
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,620
but before I tell you about that let me

190
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,139
just tell you quickly about myself so my

191
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:33,120
name is Shaw Shaw Thunderbolt as I said

192
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,800
to you I'm a South African I live in

193
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,660
Cape Town

194
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,960
um and I work for orange cyber defense I

195
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,240
spent about 15 years of my life as a

196
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,979
penetration tester running penetration

197
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,259
testing teams I also ran a vulnerability

198
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,319
scanning team but I now act as the head

199
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,660
for security research at Orange cyber

200
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,240
defense where it's my job to ask and

201
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,680
answer exactly these kinds of questions

202
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,500
I have a very luxurious job

203
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,560
so the experiment that I conceived

204
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,120
it looks a little bit like this I said

205
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,460
to myself well how can we know which

206
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,840
vulnerabilities are actually being

207
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
exploited in the wild and it turns out

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,800
there's three data sets that we can look

209
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,660
at we can look at something called the

210
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,360
Kev or the Kev which stands for the

211
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,759
known exploited vulnerabilities

212
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,479
list catalog and it's a list produced by

213
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,020
the American cisa agency to advise

214
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,940
American government agencies which

215
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,620
vulnerabilities are actively being

216
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,719
exploited in the wild there's currently

217
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,419
860 vulnerabilities on that list

218
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,458
then we can look at something that was

219
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,559
published by vanti called the ransomware

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,299
top 10 which is a list of

221
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,180
vulnerabilities that they report are

222
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:47,100
actually being used by ransomware actors

223
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,459
and then finally we can look at the epss

224
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,560
the exploit prediction scoring system

225
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,480
which is a project of the first

226
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,540
organization which attempts to predict

227
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,760
and apparently does so with some

228
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,740
accuracy which vulnerabilities are

229
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,120
actually being exploited in the wild

230
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,740
right so we have a good a reasonably

231
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,899
good data set about you know what we're

232
00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:08,459
being told is actually happening out

233
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:11,339
there then I can look at our scanning

234
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,500
data and try and determine which of

235
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,300
these vulnerabilities actually exist on

236
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,339
our customers Estates right so is there

237
00:09:17,339 --> 00:09:19,560
a match between what's being explored in

238
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,760
the wild and what our customers are

239
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,339
likely to be vulnerable to and then

240
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:24,959
finally I can look at the penetration

241
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,480
testing data and try and determine are

242
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,580
we as penetration testers when we're

243
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,459
emulating adversaries in the wild are we

244
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:33,779
actually exploiting these

245
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:35,459
vulnerabilities and Reporting them to

246
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:36,779
our customers

247
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:38,700
I'm going to check my time because I'm

248
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,399
probably going to take much too long

249
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,560
right so I want to give you some

250
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,839
background to this data it's part of my

251
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,040
story because I think it was quite an

252
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,279
interesting exercise for us

253
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,899
um the first data set that I have is

254
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,519
from our vulnerability scanning services

255
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,500
so we offer like many businesses a

256
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,820
managed vulnerability scanning service

257
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,580
we use a platform called

258
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,080
um called nucleus as a kind of

259
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,180
vulnerability aggregator so it doesn't

260
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,339
matter what scanner we're using we can

261
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,140
kind of normalize these findings collect

262
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,420
them all in one place and then collect

263
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,399
information about them

264
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,820
so what we did is as follows we we have

265
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,120
various scanners our qualis rapid7

266
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,680
they're actually a few others but those

267
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,959
are the dominant ones the findings from

268
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,600
the scanners get aggregated into nucleus

269
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,880
and then what we do is the operational

270
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,620
team so the scanning team we call them

271
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,860
the VAC vulnerability Operating Center

272
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,839
they anonymize the cost

273
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,459
excuse me they anonymize the customer

274
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,440
right so they take they mask the

275
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,740
customer name the business unit uh IP

276
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,180
addresses anything that we might be able

277
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,300
to identify from the customer we do the

278
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,980
same with customer information from the

279
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,019
CRM and then we can link those things

280
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:51,060
back up together again so that we can

281
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,019
get

282
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,620
um

283
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,260
uh demographic information so how big is

284
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
the customer what industry what size are

285
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,339
they in ETC and we pull those all into a

286
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:00,660
database and for this experiment we

287
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,640
looked at just under three million

288
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,800
findings right on on hosts

289
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
uh that ends up then in just one big

290
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,579
table which is really simple you can see

291
00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:13,320
we've got an organization an industry

292
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,720
country employee size then things like

293
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,880
asset name and IP address as I said are

294
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,360
are hashed and then OS finding Port

295
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,980
finding description all the way down so

296
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,079
very simple single table that we can now

297
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,660
model to find information about what are

298
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,420
we actually reporting to our customers

299
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,100
and then on the other hand we have

300
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,200
penetration testing reports now

301
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,760
penetration testing reports I don't know

302
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,740
how it is in your organization but

303
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,300
really the golden standard for

304
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,100
penetration testing reports is a Word

305
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,079
document that's lying on someone's desk

306
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:45,360
somewhere right you'd think that we're

307
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,860
aggregating all this data in a beautiful

308
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,579
way but we're not it's all in in word

309
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:52,380
reports as word reports have a template

310
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,680
so um we can we we can sort of group

311
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,079
them together by templates and then

312
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,820
start trying to extract usable

313
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,220
information from them and the way we do

314
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,720
it is as follows we take the word

315
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,980
documents

316
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,800
and then we use some python to unzip

317
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,860
them and pause the XML and we try and X

318
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,019
we try and extract the actual finding

319
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:15,720
information from that template into an

320
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,120
XML file which then consists of the

321
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,760
details of the report who was it for how

322
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,519
long did it take Etc and also the

323
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,800
findings what was reported and with what

324
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,700
severity then we run uh NLP capability

325
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,760
called Spacey from python to do what we

326
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,980
call Natural entity recognition so can I

327
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,560
pull out of that data things like a name

328
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,480
of an operating system a description of

329
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,700
an exploit and for us most importantly

330
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,899
for this exercise a cve and it turns out

331
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,220
this ner I don't know if you've played

332
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,680
with it at all it's fascinatingly good

333
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,540
right and it can really do some amazing

334
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,100
things but there's something that's

335
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,399
really bad at also so we want to know if

336
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,079
the pen tester exploited a given

337
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,600
application if the application contains

338
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,820
the customer's name the Nei will pull

339
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,680
that out also my team's not allowed to

340
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,139
see that so the pen testers have to

341
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:08,940
spend a lot of time cleaning that sort

342
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,040
of nonsense out so that we're not

343
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,260
exposing things like customer names and

344
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,180
then we do the same trick where we hash

345
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,940
the customer name on one hand we hash it

346
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,680
out of the CRM in the other and we can

347
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,959
pull that into a database and for this

348
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,240
experiment we pulled out just under one

349
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,639
and a half thousand penetration testing

350
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,180
reports to analyze over a period of time

351
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
and that goes into a slightly more

352
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,019
complex structure where we have

353
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,060
descriptions of the project descriptions

354
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,300
of the finding and then the ner findings

355
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,519
are pulled out in a in a table of their

356
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,200
of their own and we can link that all

357
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,839
together to get a sense of you know what

358
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,519
are our penetration test is actually

359
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,459
doing for clients

360
00:13:50,459 --> 00:13:52,680
um and the ner you'll see is able to

361
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,920
identify a whole bunch of different

362
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,240
kinds of things application names

363
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,120
version names vendor names

364
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,339
Etc and for the purposes of today's

365
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,459
presentation it's able to identify with

366
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:07,220
some accuracy cves

367
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,579
in the in the data and surprisingly this

368
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,320
in that thousand five hundred reporters

369
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,100
only 57 unique cves that that were

370
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,019
referenced specifically by pen testers

371
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:22,320
in the in the data

372
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,519
so I want to give you just a little bit

373
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:24,839
of background so you understand the data

374
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:26,480
sets that we're looking at

375
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,339
as I said in the in the scanning data

376
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,339
that's vulnerability Operating Center uh

377
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:35,700
we're looking at 41 000 hosts and

378
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,200
there's a reasonable spread of those

379
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,880
hosts across Industries and business

380
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,399
sizes there's a little bit of a waiting

381
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:42,959
towards manufacturing which I found

382
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,579
surprising

383
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:46,620
um and obviously some Industries are

384
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:48,600
more represented than others but I think

385
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,040
it's fair to say that we have a

386
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,660
reasonable representation across

387
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,639
different Industries right so no massive

388
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,139
bias there

389
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:58,380
uh similarly for business size

390
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,699
um you'll see there's a reasonable

391
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,639
distribution of business sizes mainly

392
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,420
very big or very small but it's

393
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,639
reasonably representative and then just

394
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,839
some background in terms of the things

395
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,139
that we find so if we look at confirmed

396
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:16,320
findings per host what we see I'll come

397
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,880
back to this later is that there's about

398
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,420
18 or 19 findings per host and they're

399
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,360
distributed like this to my surprise not

400
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,579
that many of those findings are low the

401
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:28,920
bulk are always medium it seems like we

402
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,139
gravitate towards them the Middle with

403
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:33,540
our risk assessments but there's also a

404
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,980
significant number of what I call

405
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,500
serious findings so highs and criticals

406
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,019
so about six highs per host on average

407
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:44,220
and just under two highs per host on a

408
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,420
critical spur host on average

409
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,699
and then in terms of the time that it

410
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,740
takes to fix them this chart shows a

411
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,720
distribution of the age of the

412
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,639
vulnerability so how long from the first

413
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,040
time that we saw it until the last time

414
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,139
that we saw it across all the 40 across

415
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:02,399
all the one the two million three

416
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,279
million vulnerabilities in the database

417
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:06,720
um and you'll see that the bulk of it

418
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,240
sits around here this is this is zero so

419
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,920
these ones are brand new they haven't

420
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,079
been addressed then we get a sort of

421
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:17,160
peak head around uh 175 another Peak at

422
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,040
around 300 days and in this odd Peak

423
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,500
here is what I call the long tail those

424
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,000
are vulnerabilities just simply never

425
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,220
they never get patched right and the

426
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,019
bulk of those are mediums for some

427
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,320
reason but what we see is that about 28

428
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,180
of the vulnerabilities get addressed in

429
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,519
under 30 days

430
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,199
um about 72 percent take between 30 and

431
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,860
days or more 52 in more than 90 days and

432
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:47,160
on average it's 215 days to remediate

433
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,600
the vulnerability now bear in mind these

434
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,360
are clients who are paying us to perform

435
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,940
a vulnerability Management Service for

436
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,560
them so that you can assume a certain

437
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,959
level of maturity but still that's how

438
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,880
long it's taking us to uh to deal with

439
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,660
vulnerabilities now you would think that

440
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,319
um

441
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,000
critical vulnerabilities get more

442
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,520
attention and that turns out to be true

443
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,179
they do get about uh 35 more attention

444
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:14,400
so they're resolved about 35 percent

445
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,859
quicker than low vulnerabilities you can

446
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:18,959
see over there but that's still over six

447
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,119
months on average for a critical

448
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,419
vulnerability to be resolved by someone

449
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:26,220
who's paying us to tell them about that

450
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,419
vulnerability

451
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:29,240
uh so it's all kind of flatly

452
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,520
disconcerting information I think if we

453
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,020
look at the penetration testing data of

454
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,400
course here icon look at time to fix

455
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
because we don't have the same rapidity

456
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,760
and I can't look at findings per host

457
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,580
but I can get some uh some other

458
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,980
insights as I said just under 1 500

459
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,100
tests again we have a leaning towards

460
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,840
finance and insurance that tends to be

461
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,700
the the bulk of our client base I guess

462
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,220
but a reasonable distribution across all

463
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,100
Industries in this data similarly a

464
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,780
reasonable distribution across business

465
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,080
sizes with the bulk being big businesses

466
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,419
that's at 47 over there but other

467
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:05,460
business sizes also represented in this

468
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,600
data set

469
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,299
also a variety of different test types

470
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:11,720
we ended up

471
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,460
normalizing on this subset of tests web

472
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,020
applications external assessments

473
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,299
internal some applications some mobile

474
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,419
platform assessments some red teaming

475
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,280
which is kind of gloves off Target

476
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,100
oriented testing as opposed to kind of

477
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,280
pre-scoped testing with the bulk being

478
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,320
web applications followed by externals

479
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,780
and then internals

480
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,080
and this is what we see so what we did

481
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,940
here was to develop a metric that we

482
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:42,000
call CVSs per day so we want to

483
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,620
normalize because some pen tests are

484
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,720
short some pain tests are long some have

485
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,360
one tester some have two testers so this

486
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,700
metric what we simply do is we add up

487
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,059
the CVSs score which is the risk rating

488
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,400
score assigned to each finding we add

489
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,559
them all up and we divide it by the

490
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,960
number of mang days spent on that test

491
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,760
right so that gives us a normalized way

492
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:04,919
to compare

493
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:06,720
tests with each other

494
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,020
and what we see there is that

495
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:10,940
um

496
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,740
unsurprisingly the the highest level of

497
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,240
findings is when the test is already

498
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,520
inside right connected to the internal

499
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,620
Network they were looking at just under

500
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,880
eight

501
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,080
CVSs points per day of testing and that

502
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
goes all the way down surprisingly to

503
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,400
Red teaming where we report just over

504
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,900
two CVSs points uh per testing but if

505
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,160
you looked at the distribution of

506
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,900
findings across these different test

507
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,440
types you'd see that in the red teaming

508
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,360
we tend to have very high severity

509
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
findings just a low number

510
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,640
and with web apps and externals we tend

511
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,020
to have mostly medium severity findings

512
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,600
all right this is all just background in

513
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,400
terms of the severity between the two

514
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,520
Services uh we see that in both cases

515
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,280
most of the findings are mediums in

516
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,020
scanning are slightly more mediums than

517
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,720
in uh pen tests and but then there's

518
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,860
still a

519
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,380
um a high proportion of critical so 10

520
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,480
for

521
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,660
um for scanning and uh three and a half

522
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,640
percent for pen testing and the sense

523
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,860
that you get is that the pen testers are

524
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,740
more deliberate more considered

525
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,140
um in the assessment of risk ratings

526
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,440
right whereas the scanner will

527
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,940
blindly assign a very high risk rating

528
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,220
the pen tester will moderate that risk

529
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,220
rating I suppose with more uh temporal

530
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,980
and and localized context

531
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,160
but still 46 percent of assets of

532
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,260
findings from the scanners would be high

533
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,880
or critical and from the pen testers

534
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,340
there's 22 percent of assets of findings

535
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,620
would be high or critical

536
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,419
yeah I also thought it very interesting

537
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,179
to compare the distribution of CVSs

538
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:57,240
scores assigned across the two kinds of

539
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,640
assessment so here the green line

540
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,700
represents uh cbs's scores assigned by

541
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,000
pen testers and the purple line uh the

542
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,480
sea basis scores assigned by scanners so

543
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,820
interestingly the the pen testers will

544
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,120
sometimes assign a cvser score of zero

545
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,200
whereas the scanner will never do it

546
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,419
that stands to reason because we we

547
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:21,679
extracted the informational findings out

548
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,020
and then you see this this peak in both

549
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,419
cases around four and five so that's

550
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,100
where all the mediums are being reported

551
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,440
the majority of findings in both cases

552
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,559
are mediums but the scan the pen testers

553
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,440
are reporting more mediums than the

554
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,039
um than the scanners and then towards

555
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,780
the end here you see the pen test is

556
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:45,539
very seldom actually report High

557
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,280
criticality findings as I said I think

558
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,919
there's more consideration more thought

559
00:21:48,919 --> 00:21:51,360
goes into the severity assigned to a

560
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,340
finding whereas the scanner keeps going

561
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,620
uh up at the end but in the end the

562
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,360
shapes are actually very similar if you

563
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,740
look at them it seems like there's a

564
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,360
similar distribution of risk ratings

565
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,880
across findings for both types of

566
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,620
services one produced by a scanner and

567
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,460
one produced by a manually buy a tester

568
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,620
also sort of interesting to look at the

569
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,020
age of the vulnerabilities so this is

570
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,000
not how long it took to patch but how

571
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,320
long the vulnerabilities actually been

572
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,080
known about and I found this uh I found

573
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,000
this pretty staggering so you'll see

574
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,440
there's a significant number of

575
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,960
vulnerabilities over here uh that are

576
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,179
over five years old reported by both the

577
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,760
scanners and the pen testers and I find

578
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,860
that extraordinary that somebody pays a

579
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,860
pen tester to come in and test and they

580
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,600
have vulnerabilities on their systems

581
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,860
that have existed since you know 2015

582
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:45,059
2010 even so 47 of the cves reported

583
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,340
across both services are more than five

584
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,980
years old and about half a percent or

585
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,500
more than 20 years old now fortunately

586
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,360
we're not seeing pen testers reporting

587
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,039
those but at the vulnerability scanner

588
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:57,780
is reporting vulnerabilities dating all

589
00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:00,659
the way back to 1999 which also gives

590
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:02,700
you cause to think a little bit about

591
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,080
what we're really doing

592
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,059
all right but I want to get to the main

593
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,039
question the main question is are we

594
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:10,020
reporting vulnerabilities that are

595
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,720
actually being exploited in the wild

596
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,700
and the first data set that I mentioned

597
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,960
to you is that we can look at this event

598
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,260
here ransomware top 10 data set so this

599
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,100
is a report that's published by csw

600
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,919
securing cyware and Avanti and it gives

601
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,380
an analysis that vulnerabilities that

602
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,480
are actually used by ransomware threat

603
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,340
actors in the wild now they don't

604
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,200
disclose how they get those

605
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,940
vulnerabilities so this data set is a

606
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,520
little bit difficult for me to make

607
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,700
sense of but they publish a top 10 most

608
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,380
exploited vulnerabilities used by

609
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,520
ransomware threat actors

610
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,080
would be are we seeing those

611
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,240
vulnerabilities

612
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,740
amongst our clients so what you're going

613
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,120
to see now is I'm going to repeatedly

614
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,100
show you two graphs I'm going to show

615
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,020
you vulnerabilities across a percentage

616
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,179
of our clients so at how What proportion

617
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:01,500
of our clients are we seeing this

618
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,720
vulnerability and then a proportion of

619
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,980
our assets so you're talking kind of

620
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:07,380
breadth and depth I guess is going to be

621
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,880
the two charts

622
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,700
so we see that of the ransomware top 10

623
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,559
we only

624
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:17,640
ever see half of the top 10 ransomware

625
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,440
most exploited vulnerabilities right the

626
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,020
other other five never appear anywhere

627
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,520
in our data

628
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,460
uh the one we see the most at just under

629
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,700
18 at 17 of our clients actually is

630
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,580
log4j right so log4j appears at about 17

631
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,419
of our clients where we do scanning and

632
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,460
then it goes down from there and then of

633
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,020
course if you look at the distribution

634
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,520
across assets that's going to look

635
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,919
different uh log 4J doesn't appear on a

636
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,960
lot of assets right it's not it's not

637
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,880
hugely deployed on our customer States

638
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,720
but it is deployed at a lot of customers

639
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,860
just out of Interest what those

640
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,780
vulnerabilities are I'm not a pen tester

641
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,100
anymore so I'm I'm a little

642
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,960
uncomfortable with all these cve numbers

643
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,539
I'm looking at the at the percentages

644
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:02,100
really

645
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,260
um but that one not log4j is a uh is a

646
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,840
Microsoft Office remote code execution

647
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,220
vulnerability so this is the sort of

648
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,900
thing you would you would exploit using

649
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,120
a phishing attack or a water holding

650
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,039
attack right it's not something you

651
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,580
would exploit over the over the network

652
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,159
and that one which is the most commonly

653
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:25,320
seen across the assets is an incident

654
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,940
Explorer

655
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,640
um memory corruption vulnerability so

656
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,960
also something that you would need a

657
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
client-side exploit for right not

658
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,679
something you're going to exploit over

659
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:36,179
the network

660
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:40,559
now of those five vulnerabilities how

661
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,539
many did we report in our penetration

662
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,320
tests and the answer is exactly one so

663
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,480
exactly one of those ransomware top 10

664
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,720
was exploited by a pen tester over about

665
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,940
a four-year period

666
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,820
um in that 1500 pen test that we looked

667
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,820
at and that was log4j log4j and log4j

668
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:04,140
was exploited exactly once in one test

669
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,140
the next data set we can look at is the

670
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,779
is the Kev the known exported

671
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,600
vulnerabilities as I said published by

672
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,539
Cesar they also have their own internal

673
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,659
processes we don't know how they decide

674
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:21,120
to add something to this uh to this list

675
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,220
but at the time that we did this work

676
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,320
there were about 860 vulnerabilities

677
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,320
that were published on the Kev by Cesar

678
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,820
and are mandatory for U.S government

679
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,159
agencies to to patch right that's a it's

680
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:37,860
there's a drive down obligation on those

681
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,679
agencies to patch these 861 abilities

682
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,140
now this is obviously a much bigger data

683
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,720
set than the 10 ransomware top 10 so we

684
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,480
would expect to see them more and indeed

685
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,760
we do this is kind of how it looks if I

686
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,400
look at a distribution of those care

687
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,620
vulnerabilities across a distribution of

688
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,120
our customers right so we have to think

689
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,760
of two proportions over here I'll try

690
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,360
and explain it to you from here so 52 of

691
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,360
the Kev just just over half of those 860

692
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,059
vulnerabilities are never seen anywhere

693
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:12,600
at any client right 42 000 assets we

694
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,419
don't see half of the Kev anyway and

695
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:17,279
then it drops down we see about six and

696
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,779
a half percent of the care that two

697
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:21,120
percent of our clients five percent of

698
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,559
the care that five percent of our

699
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,539
clients and then there's this peak over

700
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:26,279
here where we see about fourteen percent

701
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,440
of the care of at about 15 of our

702
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,960
clients and those are mostly Microsoft

703
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,240
desktop vulnerabilities so it's to be

704
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,039
expected right it's a very very commonly

705
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,940
deployed software very widely in use

706
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,400
um also being exploited in the wild and

707
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,679
we are seeing it at about 15 percent of

708
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,480
our clients and then the number drops

709
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,059
down and that uh there's you know some

710
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:49,860
vulnerability basically probably one

711
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,080
vulnerability in the Kev that's seen at

712
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,059
about 44 of our customers will look at

713
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:55,440
what that is now

714
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,340
if you look at what those

715
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,039
vulnerabilities actually are

716
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,480
um you'll see there's I just took the

717
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,340
top 10 here by the way or the top 20 I

718
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,419
can't remember it's not all of them the

719
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:06,419
list is much longer obviously but there

720
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:07,679
we see

721
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,880
um

722
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,520
and log for J again in the top of the

723
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,900
list there in terms of the number of

724
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,799
clients uh that are impacted by it

725
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,080
um and if we look at the most commonly

726
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,520
reported vulnerability it's a Apache mod

727
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,940
proxy vulnerability that allows uh

728
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,559
unauthorized redirect into an internal

729
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,440
Network so not a remote code execution

730
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,200
but something that will allow you to

731
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,700
bypass a firewall or something for

732
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,539
example

733
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,340
in terms of

734
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,640
Distribution on assets is the this one

735
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,240
isn't something a vulnerability next JS

736
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,039
that allows for a redirect from an

737
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,140
untrusted domain and from a trusted

738
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,179
domain to an untrusted domain again

739
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,100
something that you would use in a in a

740
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:56,100
phishing attack for example so not

741
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,200
um not very sexy vulnerabilities not the

742
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,059
sort of things that you'd kind of you

743
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:02,340
know want to sink your teeth into and

744
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,799
get all excited about but the point

745
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,799
being from this graph is that we do see

746
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:10,260
if I just go back we do see a

747
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:12,600
significant number of vulnerabilities uh

748
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,559
48 of the Kev somewhere on our customer

749
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,080
estate and so the question is which of

750
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,440
those are we wanna are we testing uh are

751
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,120
we reporting on our penetration tests

752
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,760
and in fact we've only reported one two

753
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,960
three four five six seven of those 860

754
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,899
vulnerabilities in penetration tests at

755
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:37,080
our at our clients so a massive

756
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,480
um if you like disconnect from the 860

757
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,059
down to just seven one of which again is

758
00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:45,000
of course log 4J and this one which is

759
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,220
the one that's used the most frequently

760
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,260
but still at less than three percent of

761
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,620
our clients is a remote desktop Services

762
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,159
remote code execution so unpost

763
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:57,720
unpatched remote desk Microsoft Remote

764
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,000
Desktop probably exposed onto the

765
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,940
internet is being used to access the

766
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:06,899
customer Network penetration testers

767
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,360
and then finally we can take a look at

768
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,219
this epss model

769
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,480
and just out of interest can I check how

770
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,600
many people have engaged with epss

771
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,120
as a scoring system one really are you

772
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,500
guys being honest is it like a French

773
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,059
thing you don't

774
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:26,640
then it's it's not entirely confidential

775
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,700
I don't think if you are I I'm surprised

776
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,039
at how little we talk about this so epss

777
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,860
is a project by the first organization

778
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,140
it's an open source non-open source but

779
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,039
a free public benefit uh project that

780
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,100
seeks to use machine learning to predict

781
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,460
whether a given cve will be exploited in

782
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,360
the wild

783
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,120
and in the latest version of epss which

784
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,279
is now version three they've got a big

785
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,860
cloud-based machine that does all the

786
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,539
modeling they look at about a thousand

787
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:59,460
four hundred and something different

788
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,399
variables to make a prediction as to

789
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,980
whether a given vulnerability is going

790
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,320
to be exploited in the wild somewhere

791
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,720
within the next 30 days

792
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,399
and there is also really quite

793
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:13,440
astounding they predict their

794
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,960
predictions are almost perfect all right

795
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,659
straight up the line you can uh they've

796
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,039
published a very nice white paper on how

797
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,539
they do it and really what they're

798
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:24,360
trying to do is to allow you to make the

799
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,399
distinction between the thousands and

800
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,080
thousands of

801
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,860
um cves that are exist and the exploited

802
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:34,380
CVS and they've just recently published

803
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,539
a paper on the effectiveness of their

804
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:39,179
new model which is version three and

805
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,440
basically what they're looking at is

806
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,260
what how much effort in this comparison

807
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,860
how much effort would it take us to

808
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,460
patch 82 percent of all exploited

809
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,860
vulnerabilities right so if we wanted a

810
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,200
coverage of 82 percent how much work

811
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,500
would we have to do if we used CVSs as a

812
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,440
guide or if we used epss as a guide

813
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,440
and if you're using CVSs as a guide and

814
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,720
you want to cover 82 percent of all

815
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,120
exploited vulnerabilities then you would

816
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,419
need to patch everything with a CVSs

817
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:15,360
score of 7 or above which means patching

818
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,279
58 half of all published cves ever would

819
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,659
have to be patched in your organization

820
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:25,320
to deal with just 82 percent of the

821
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,640
vulnerabilities that are actually being

822
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,620
exploited in the wild which means an

823
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,620
efficiency of 3.9 percent so only four

824
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,419
out of every 100 vulnerabilities that

825
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:35,700
you patch would it ever actually run the

826
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,860
risk of being exploited in the wild

827
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,159
eps's version 3 on the other hand at a

828
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,460
threshold of above 0.88 0.088 which is

829
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,460
very low threshold you would only have

830
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:50,220
to patch 7.3 percent of all

831
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:53,279
vulnerabilities to get to 80 of all

832
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,320
exploited vulnerabilities and that gives

833
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,960
you an efficiency of 45 all right so

834
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,360
it's a much more efficient much more

835
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,419
accurate way of predicting what's

836
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:06,059
actually being exploited in the wild

837
00:33:06,059 --> 00:33:11,159
so we draw a report of all epss rated

838
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,200
vulnerabilities with the prediction

839
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,320
score of higher than

840
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,240
0.03 now the reason we chose that is

841
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,580
because in their own analysis they say

842
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,080
you could get a

843
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,960
um you can get perfect coverage from or

844
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,899
optimal coverage from a efficiency score

845
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:29,120
of

846
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,860
0.036 right so we went a little further

847
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,840
than that and we said let's take 0.03

848
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,600
and we drew all the vulnerabilities that

849
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:40,320
reached that rating level for the period

850
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,299
that we also have scanning data right so

851
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:43,620
we could see how many of these do we

852
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,850
find in our in our scans

853
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:46,980
[Applause]

854
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,260
um and indeed we do find them again

855
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,880
95

856
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,700
of those epss rated vulnerabilities

857
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,700
there's about 155 vulnerabilities that

858
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,980
meet that threshold for the period that

859
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:04,200
we're looking at 95 percent of them

860
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,500
don't occur at any of our clients but

861
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,659
about five percent of them do and this

862
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:13,219
kind of shows the uh shows the

863
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:15,780
distribution right so

864
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:20,399
um 20 of those cves appear at 0.37 of

865
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,418
our clients

866
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:24,060
doesn't really matter the point is we

867
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,639
mostly don't see them but we do see some

868
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,379
of them so everything under the curve

869
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,560
over here are vulnerabilities with a

870
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,960
very high probability of being exploited

871
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,000
extremely high probability of being

872
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,239
exploited that are being reported at our

873
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,699
customers on our customers Estates right

874
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:43,739
we know that they're there and the

875
00:34:43,739 --> 00:34:45,418
question of course then going back to my

876
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:48,000
original thesis is well how many of

877
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,560
these are our pen testers actually

878
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,139
reporting to our clients

879
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:54,000
uh sorry these are the ones that they

880
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,000
are so there's an open ssld dos which is

881
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,099
kind of really odd and then there's this

882
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:01,920
Windows 10 HTTP server

883
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,560
um exploit those are the ones that we're

884
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,660
seeing on our customers of States but as

885
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,339
I said the question really for us is how

886
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,780
many of them are our pen testers

887
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,359
reporting and the answer is an

888
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:15,000
astounding zero we couldn't find one of

889
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,980
those vulnerabilities in a single pin

890
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,920
test uh report that we gave to our

891
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,200
clients now I'm not saying that's right

892
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,500
or wrong or good or bad that's I'm you

893
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,300
know I'm not a pen test anymore I'm a

894
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,099
researcher but I did find it quite

895
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:31,079
astounding you know and I thought it

896
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:33,240
would be worth having a conversation

897
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,940
with the security Community to ask like

898
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:38,280
does this make sense if if we're not

899
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,020
reporting these vulnerabilities to our

900
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:43,200
clients in pinterests then you know are

901
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,140
we telling them the right thing

902
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,700
I want to point out something else that

903
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,960
occurred to me when I was looking at

904
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,079
this data which also Sparks debate so

905
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,300
one of the things that we did was to

906
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,880
look at how much are we reporting to

907
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,780
clients per day over time right now

908
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,000
these graphs get a little bit sticky but

909
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,079
basically

910
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,680
when we went back as far as 2018 you'll

911
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,820
see that the average CVSs reported per

912
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,400
day so a sense of how much are we saying

913
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
to the client in 2018 in the first

914
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,400
quarter of 2018 was 5.5 by the time we

915
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,140
get to the first quarter or the third

916
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,300
quarter of 2022 that's when our data

917
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,540
collection stopped we're only reporting

918
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,359
um what is that just over 4.5 just over

919
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,780
four so there's this dramatic increase

920
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:35,640
in the volume of things that we're

921
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,460
saying to our customers in fact if I

922
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,160
were to show you this graph for only new

923
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,680
customers so this includes businesses

924
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,240
that are coming back again and again and

925
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,099
again if I only looked at businesses

926
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:49,079
that came to us for the first time you

927
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:52,260
would see a 50 percent decrease in the

928
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,420
volume and severity of findings that

929
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,060
we're reporting to our to our clients

930
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,160
there's another perspective that we can

931
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,040
use look at the same data and I just

932
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,420
wanted to draw your attention to this

933
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,599
drop sorry before I forget so this is

934
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,140
at the peak of the covid lock lockdowns

935
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,760
right I'm going to destroy your

936
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,020
attention to this because we're going to

937
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,839
come back to that in a moment

938
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,940
um but this is another perspective on

939
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,119
the same question where we look at the

940
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,240
ratio between serious and not serious

941
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,200
findings in a in a report so in 2018 in

942
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:32,339
fact here in Q4 of 2018 71 of the

943
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,680
findings in a in a penetration test on

944
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,020
average would have been serious higher

945
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,540
critical findings by the time we get to

946
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:44,160
q1 in 2022 it's only 33 so we've gone

947
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,720
from three quarters of the findings

948
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,420
being serious to only one third of the

949
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,420
findings being serious over a Over a

950
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,640
four-year period and this question of

951
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,440
why these numbers are going down like

952
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,960
this is uh this makes me very curious

953
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,480
you know like why why would it be so

954
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,099
another perspective we took and again

955
00:38:02,099 --> 00:38:03,980
there's that dip by the way there's the

956
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:07,680
q1 of or Q2 of 2020 where it reads its

957
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,140
absolute lowest

958
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,660
so one of the explanations might be that

959
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,240
as customers are coming back over over

960
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,980
and over the number of findings we're

961
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,200
reporting is getting less and less and

962
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,079
in fact that does seem to be the case so

963
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,780
for customers to only test with us once

964
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:29,220
we're reporting 4.7 cve points not cve

965
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,040
CVSs points per day for customers who

966
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,440
come to us more than 10 times it's like

967
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,040
4.6 so there's a line downwards what's

968
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,920
odd is this jump over here so I said

969
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,420
more than one but basically this means

970
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,359
two because more than one but not more

971
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,000
than two is two so I don't know why I

972
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,880
made it so complicated but it's two so

973
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,920
this is two when they do two we we have

974
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,160
the highest number of findings and the

975
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,599
conclusion we reached is because

976
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,880
normally when a customer does exactly

977
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,460
two tests with our teams they're doing

978
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:07,020
one internal and One external once so

979
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,480
basically this is almost an anomalous

980
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,940
situation where it's like a a one source

981
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,560
for compliance the customer comes in for

982
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,540
like a one two it's like a many and a

983
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,040
pity you know you get your feet and your

984
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,140
nails done it's that but you only do it

985
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,180
once so that's where that very high

986
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,160
number comes in but then it sort of

987
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,260
drops down from there the more tests the

988
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,720
customers do so why would it be that

989
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,380
we're seeing this decrease in levels of

990
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:34,380
finding over time well the one Theory

991
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,540
could be that security is just getting

992
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:40,440
better maybe between 2018 and 2022 our

993
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,060
clients have become better at securing

994
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,880
their systems another theory is that

995
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,920
maybe our testers are getting worse you

996
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,940
know I don't know how many of you are

997
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,800
young testers yeah but obviously my

998
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,500
generation were much better than Mia's

999
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,599
generation you know we had the

1000
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:56,579
but I don't think that's I don't think

1001
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:59,040
either of those are the case one theory

1002
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,359
that I've got which I think is very

1003
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,060
interesting is that when we look at new

1004
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,339
customers who are coming to test they're

1005
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,680
generally testing new systems and those

1006
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,900
systems are now often being built with

1007
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,980
you know

1008
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,680
um cloud-based hosting

1009
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,119
um you know all kinds of sort of

1010
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,460
cloud-based back-end stuff and much more

1011
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:20,339
robust uh development Frameworks Etc

1012
00:40:20,339 --> 00:40:22,619
there's much less Legacy in those

1013
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,900
platforms and that would help to explain

1014
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,839
why we see this massive drop down which

1015
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:30,359
I think is encouraging and uh is a is a

1016
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,200
good sign

1017
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,300
and then Dominic white who's certainly

1018
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,099
not here but he leads our pen testing

1019
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,040
operations he made another point which

1020
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,160
is if you recall that dip in

1021
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,880
um in 2022 he says what happened is that

1022
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,460
in 2022 we couldn't go on site to

1023
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,859
customers anymore and so now testing

1024
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:53,040
started to happen over a VPN and so the

1025
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,200
perspective that the tester gets of the

1026
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,520
app of the environment that they're

1027
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,280
testing becomes much more constrained

1028
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,200
and of course even though the lockdowns

1029
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,680
lifted those habits continued and so now

1030
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,300
basically the testers are getting a much

1031
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,480
more constrained scope of of what

1032
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,160
they're seeing anyways that's a bit of a

1033
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,339
thrower side uh observation of the of

1034
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:16,500
the data that I thought I hoped you

1035
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,660
would find interesting I want to end

1036
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,859
with

1037
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:20,579
um

1038
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,500
a bit of a different observation so

1039
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,960
we've been looking a lot at numbers and

1040
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,420
how much we see things and how often you

1041
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,760
know they occur Etc but of course what

1042
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,500
people have been talking about a lot and

1043
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,839
I'm sure you have also is this recent

1044
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,300
last past compromise and I don't know

1045
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,859
about you but I've been working very

1046
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,440
hard to try and understand exactly how

1047
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,480
that compromise happened

1048
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,700
um thank you and it's I haven't fully

1049
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,160
got my head around it but of course they

1050
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,020
were hacked purportedly for the first

1051
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,720
time in like August of last year and

1052
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:54,420
then for the last time of in March of

1053
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:56,400
this year and it turns out that it's

1054
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,020
actually a series of three interrelated

1055
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,480
compromises right so we know that in the

1056
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,220
beginning they they compromise some

1057
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,500
development environment uh using

1058
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,720
compromised endpoints which allow them

1059
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,240
to bypass MFA and now they're drifting

1060
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,680
around in a development environment

1061
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,020
somewhere LastPass catches them and

1062
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:17,940
throws them out and the report they give

1063
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:20,220
us is no damage done a little bit of

1064
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,680
customer data perhaps leaked out but

1065
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,560
it's all in vaults it's all encrypted

1066
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,760
everyone is safe

1067
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,099
then we find out that there was a second

1068
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:31,920
compromise and this compromise involved

1069
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,040
a cloud environment which was co-hosted

1070
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,839
or shared with their owner which is a

1071
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:39,119
company called go to and they're able to

1072
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,900
get some other data including access to

1073
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:45,720
the backups of the full vaults right so

1074
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,339
now they've got the full encrypted Vault

1075
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:49,500
but they don't have the passwords to

1076
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,560
unlock the Vault and so just a few weeks

1077
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,260
ago we get the report that they somehow

1078
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,859
managed to find a developer's home

1079
00:42:58,859 --> 00:42:59,940
network

1080
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,819
somehow identified a Plex server that

1081
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:04,619
the developer was running

1082
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:07,680
that had a vulnerability on it that they

1083
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,660
were able to exploit and then somehow

1084
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,480
from there it ran a key logger on a

1085
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,760
machine that he was using to log into

1086
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,339
the Vault and then use that password

1087
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:19,980
from The Vault to decrypt the passwords

1088
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,920
from stage one and stage two and now

1089
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:25,020
it's an I don't know it's a disaster all

1090
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,640
right now it's a big thing and I thought

1091
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,579
to myself this sort of thinking this

1092
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,460
sort of activity

1093
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,500
is not being represented in my data

1094
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,560
right this sort of stringing things

1095
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,780
together from like one environment to

1096
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,579
another environment and finding the

1097
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:43,079
developers home network how did they

1098
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,760
even do that I don't know you know they

1099
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,200
found this guy's home environment found

1100
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,680
his Plex server it's just a remarkable

1101
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,420
level of sophistication and operational

1102
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,760
coherence

1103
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,319
um and it occurs me that one of the

1104
00:43:55,319 --> 00:43:57,119
stories we could be telling about paint

1105
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,160
testing is

1106
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,900
um that this is what pen testing should

1107
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:04,740
be showing us not reporting on um on the

1108
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,839
cves that the bad guys are also using in

1109
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,300
the wild of course the twist in this

1110
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,880
story is that they did exploit a cve

1111
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,079
right

1112
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:14,280
um that's what almost everyone's talking

1113
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,800
about the most they exploited a cve in

1114
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,839
Plex

1115
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,359
CV

1116
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:24,240
2025741 High severity flow in Plex Media

1117
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,640
Server and this was apparently what

1118
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,140
allowed them to get access to the

1119
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:29,940
developers Network to deploy the key

1120
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,160
logger to steal the password Vault to

1121
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,920
decrypt the data all right key so I got

1122
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:36,240
to wondering well do we see that

1123
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,940
vulnerability turns out that if you take

1124
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,339
the epss scores for the last 12 months

1125
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:43,859
and you look at everything over 0.03 it

1126
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:45,060
doesn't appear

1127
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:48,119
so if that would have been useful to

1128
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,579
them and of course we didn't see it

1129
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,440
anyway right we didn't see it on any of

1130
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,140
our customer environments anyway I don't

1131
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:56,579
know what that means I just thought it

1132
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:58,260
provided a bit of an interesting counter

1133
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,359
example to like how exploits actually

1134
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:01,859
happen

1135
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,700
um pump compromises actually happen and

1136
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:08,160
um how useful of scanning and our

1137
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,079
testing is at uh at predicting how they

1138
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,880
happen I want to end with this thought

1139
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,960
uh at the end of his presentation says

1140
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,839
um having criticized pen testing uh left

1141
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,240
right in the center he says look if you

1142
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,520
think you have smarts if you think

1143
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,859
you're a clever person then maybe this

1144
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,720
is something that we need to think about

1145
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:30,720
I don't know what this data what these

1146
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,579
observations are telling us about how

1147
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:35,160
effective our risk assessment is using

1148
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,079
scanning and pin testing but it

1149
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,700
certainly raises a lot of questions for

1150
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,319
me about whether we're doing the right

1151
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,140
thing to advise our clients about how to

1152
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,800
make sense of all the threats that are

1153
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,839
chasing us down in the wild and that's

1154
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,280
all we're going to have time for thank

1155
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,319
you very much everyone

1156
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:54,599
um just a quick one if you want to read

1157
00:45:54,599 --> 00:45:56,760
our report where most of this data is in

1158
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,220
it's called the security Navigator uh

1159
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,800
there's the the URL there not all the

1160
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,720
data is in network but some of it is in

1161
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,940
there so take a moment to have a

1162
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,560
look-see otherwise I think we've maybe

1163
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:08,700
got a few minutes for questions yes

1164
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,819
thank you sir so ladies and gentlemen if

1165
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:13,980
you have some question or you have 15

1166
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:18,920
minutes to ask Mr Thunderbolt thank you

1167
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,310
[Applause]

1168
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,140
please somebody ask a question

1169
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,279
one oh there's one

1170
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,000
hello thank you nice presentation all

1171
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,740
right thank you I also love the slide

1172
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,359
background with the high score that was

1173
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,900
awesome but the question is the uh do

1174
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,980
you think that one of the issues we're

1175
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,140
seeing with vulnerabilities is that we

1176
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,579
have an increased number of

1177
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:49,880
vulnerabilities or cves reported for

1178
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,900
very specific non-enterprise

1179
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,700
Technologies like iot

1180
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,680
OT systems that are inflating these

1181
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,420
numbers and so making it harder to get

1182
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:58,500
stronger

1183
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:01,380
signal from that overall noise yeah I do

1184
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,480
I do think so I think there's it's very

1185
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,400
clear to me that between cve and CVSs

1186
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,960
we've created a bit of a monster that

1187
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,599
might not actually be uh useful to us

1188
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,579
and I think that

1189
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:16,200
um the security Community the vendor

1190
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,160
side of the security Community

1191
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,800
definitely needs to start changing our

1192
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,200
narrative around those vulnerabilities

1193
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,680
it's not useful I think to um you know

1194
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,839
as a pen testing company one of the

1195
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,339
things that we're asked when we present

1196
00:47:29,339 --> 00:47:31,740
to customers is well how many cves have

1197
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,839
you published you know so cve's

1198
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,520
publishing CVS becomes a sort of a

1199
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,200
scoreboard and I don't think that's

1200
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,359
useful and it's not helping us I I think

1201
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,000
it's useful to have that common

1202
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,560
designator but I think we're using it in

1203
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,140
the wrong way and it seems also clear to

1204
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,839
me that the CVSs score for all its good

1205
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:51,839
intent is not actually adding a lot of

1206
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,900
value uh certainly when it's statically

1207
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:57,660
is you know ascribed or to a single

1208
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:59,220
vulnerability

1209
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:02,180
I do think so

1210
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,280
one more question well oh there's

1211
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,920
another one yeah inspiring stocks thanks

1212
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,260
um I want to follow up I thought the

1213
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,880
part of the different industry is really

1214
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,819
interesting and I wanted to ask if was

1215
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:16,560
there some indication that some

1216
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,599
Industries which are maybe like denoted

1217
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:19,560
to be

1218
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,460
slower adopting new Stacks be less tech

1219
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:26,339
savvy that they kind of perform worse in

1220
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:29,339
terms of your terminology of cbss points

1221
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,819
per day yeah there is let me see I might

1222
00:48:32,819 --> 00:48:36,500
actually even have the data

1223
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,900
slides

1224
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,300
there you go that's what it looks like

1225
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,700
across the industries we have in our

1226
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,500
data set now it's not a perfect

1227
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,680
representation the Blue Line shows the

1228
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,480
total number of days that we spend

1229
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,300
testing in that industry right so it

1230
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,680
gives you a sense of how many customers

1231
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,000
how much effort we put into that

1232
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,240
industry and the green line shows the

1233
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,760
CVSs per day

1234
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:04,980
now I think the ones with very low blue

1235
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,839
lines we can ignore because they're

1236
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:09,359
probably anomalous so I think you can

1237
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:12,720
ignore uh retail it's uh sorry you can

1238
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,220
ignore real estate that's obviously a

1239
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,839
very small data set I wouldn't worry

1240
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:17,940
about that too much but you can see for

1241
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,520
example as one would expect in finance

1242
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,700
and uh and insurance the number is much

1243
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,000
lower than in something like

1244
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,380
um there you go and professional and

1245
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:31,140
scientific Services where we see a

1246
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:34,319
higher number so there is a there is a

1247
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,480
variance I can send you this data in

1248
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,099
fact I think we published this data in

1249
00:49:38,099 --> 00:49:41,099
the in the report also but I don't think

1250
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,819
that my data set is big enough to really

1251
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:46,740
draw conclusions about whether some

1252
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:49,800
Industries perform better than others

1253
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,200
I'll share another anecdote one of the

1254
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,940
things that my team has been very

1255
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,800
interesting in understanding interested

1256
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,859
in understanding is that we see in terms

1257
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,079
of exploits in the compromises in the

1258
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,180
wild we see a very high number of

1259
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,940
compromises in the wild at manufacturing

1260
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,680
businesses so businesses that are in

1261
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,200
aics classified as manufacturing and

1262
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,520
we're trying to understand why that is

1263
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,680
and so we compared the manufacturing

1264
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,540
industry to all other Industries in

1265
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,040
terms of how long does it take them to

1266
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,560
patch how many vulnerabilities per host

1267
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:22,079
CV assist per day all of those things to

1268
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:23,720
see if they stand out

1269
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,980
and actually they don't I was very

1270
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:27,780
disappointed as a researcher and I had

1271
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:28,920
all this data and I thought I was going

1272
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,380
to be able to explain why we see so many

1273
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:33,720
exploits or compromises in one industry

1274
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,700
compared to other Industries but the

1275
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,619
answer to that question doesn't seem to

1276
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:40,440
be in how long it takes them to patch or

1277
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,880
how many vulnerability is they have

1278
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,440
co-host I don't know if that answers

1279
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,920
your question

1280
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,000
there's one more there I think in the

1281
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,119
middle

1282
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,700
thanks a lot

1283
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,000
um my question is in my experience for

1284
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,200
pen test a lot of the things that you

1285
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,339
see are

1286
00:50:59,339 --> 00:51:03,420
I would say maybe 40 in my case are

1287
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,400
actually not really related to cves but

1288
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,599
more business logic flaws and

1289
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:08,760
implementation flaws for credential

1290
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,040
management clear text yeah how do you

1291
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,780
deal that and how you put that in your

1292
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,480
yeah so in this study we're not trying

1293
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:17,400
to look at that because we wanted

1294
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,260
something that we could cross-reference

1295
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,740
and of course that's uh that cve

1296
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,680
um so I haven't actually looked at how

1297
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,900
often those kinds of flaws appear in the

1298
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,420
data the ner is actually able to pull it

1299
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,339
out which is quite nice but I haven't I

1300
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,200
haven't studied that

1301
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,660
um I guess the question that I would ask

1302
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:41,520
back is that pen tester is reporting you

1303
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,020
know sophisticated web application

1304
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,420
business logic flaws to a customer and

1305
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,859
they're fixing it that's obviously work

1306
00:51:46,859 --> 00:51:48,720
well done but if the customer is

1307
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,780
actually being popped by ransomware

1308
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,760
actors using a zero using a known

1309
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,920
vulnerability Internet Explorer that's

1310
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,859
the dissonance that I'm curious to to

1311
00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:00,420
understand and I think that's the point

1312
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,880
uh harunmir was making when he said are

1313
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,500
we emulating the attacker or we're

1314
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,500
emulating the other pen testers you know

1315
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,599
there's a sort of

1316
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,700
um like remarkable level of technical

1317
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,099
agility that emerges in the pen testing

1318
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,680
space but really what's happening if you

1319
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,960
look at for example cyber extortion and

1320
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,780
in Ransom ways it's uh password reuse

1321
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:24,180
credential stuffing uh unpatched

1322
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:28,380
internet facing servers and phishing you

1323
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,660
know over and over and over again and

1324
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:32,040
it's I suppose exactly that is the

1325
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,900
question that I'm asking is should we be

1326
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,099
doing all that web application

1327
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,380
gymnastics or should we rather be

1328
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,660
focusing on looking broadly and

1329
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,460
identifying these vulnerabilities that

1330
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:43,500
are exposed in the wild and patching

1331
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,880
those very quickly

1332
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,880
maybe that's a more sensible approach I

1333
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,020
don't know but I think that's the

1334
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:51,720
question I'm asking I think there was a

1335
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:53,760
gentleman over here

1336
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,740
and and just to add I'm sure there's not

1337
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,599
one answer to that right it's probably

1338
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,839
some mixture between both but

1339
00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:04,460
the gentleman of the orange shirt

1340
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:06,960
thank you

1341
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,480
um my question was in the same way it

1342
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:12,240
was much more about context because if

1343
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,180
you look at a given cve

1344
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,420
it will not be the same risk if it's

1345
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:20,220
inside or outside

1346
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,579
yeah how do you deal with that in your

1347
00:53:23,579 --> 00:53:26,160
reports so I I I'm not trying to deal

1348
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,140
with it in my rewards

1349
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,040
um it is one of the criticisms that's

1350
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:34,680
um leveraged against the epss exactly

1351
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,200
that and there's this concept of uh

1352
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,359
what is this like path to code or

1353
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,099
something so like what is the route that

1354
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,960
you have to get there

1355
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,839
um but the the the epss working group

1356
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,500
counters that by saying actually if you

1357
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,260
ignore that completely and you just look

1358
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:55,500
at what are we seeing being exploited in

1359
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:58,500
the wild then their prediction system

1360
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:01,800
path to code notwithstanding is in fact

1361
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:04,140
very very powerful at knowing how you're

1362
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,200
going to be hit so I think uh yeah I'm

1363
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,579
not trying to address it but I know that

1364
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:11,099
epss addresses it by showing a this

1365
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:14,579
perfect 45 45 degree correlation graph

1366
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:17,160
that says if they said 100 it's going to

1367
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,559
be exploited then 100 it gets exploited

1368
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:22,440
regardless of what the path uh is so I

1369
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:24,059
guess their model is perhaps taking some

1370
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:25,740
of those variables into account

1371
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,180
even if it's not deliberate

1372
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,099
okay I guess that's all we have time for

1373
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:38,359
thank you very much for your attention
