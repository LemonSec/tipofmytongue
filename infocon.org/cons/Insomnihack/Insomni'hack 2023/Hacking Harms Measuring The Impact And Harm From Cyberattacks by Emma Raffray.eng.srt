1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,060
good morning it's a real pleasure to be

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,799
amongst you today so my name is

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:09,000
Charlotte Lindsey and I'm the chief

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,219
public policy officer at the Cyber peace

5
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,300
Institute

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,820
and hi everyone my name is Emma raffray

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,560
I'm the chief research and Analysis

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
officer also at The Institute it's my

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,359
first time at insomnia so be kind to us

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,100
today

11
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,260
so the aim of today we're really going

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,660
to talk about the harms and impact

13
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,760
methodology that the Institute has been

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,460
developing to do that we'll take you

15
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,739
briefly through Who The Institute is

16
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:36,960
just as an indicator how many people in

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,820
the room have heard of or know of the

18
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,879
work of The cyberpiece Institute

19
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,480
okay and so I will give a very brief

20
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,040
introduction for those who have not

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,079
heard of The Institute before and then

22
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,120
we will walk you through

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
um some of the approaches that I use to

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
currently use to measure harms and

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,879
impact and why that's important and we

26
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,980
will take some examples from the health

27
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,960
attacks on Healthcare sector attacks

28
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,420
currently in Ukraine and then where

29
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,519
we're taking this methodology and and

30
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,040
its importance going forward so with

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,500
that I will just kick off on

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,659
um on on The cyberpiece Institute so the

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,100
cyberpiece Institute is a

34
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,619
non-governmental organization based in

35
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,200
Geneva which is independent and neutral

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,799
and its work is very much to to try to

37
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,080
build stability in cyberspace and

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,780
greater accountability towards

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,240
um against thread actors and to to to

40
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,460
support really vulnerable communities

41
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,040
who are affected by cyber uh cyber

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,380
incidences uh it's only three years old

43
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,320
The Institute and we have a real

44
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,060
multi-disciplinary expertise

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,640
and that really looks at an Evidence and

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,920
data-driven approach to try to

47
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,840
understand how we can assist

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,780
particularly vulnerable communities and

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,939
in that we have a cyber peace Builders

50
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:56,040
program which is supporting humanitarian

51
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,500
the non-governmental organizations to

52
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,659
build up their cyber security resilience

53
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,439
and we also assisted Healthcare and also

54
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,780
we look at a particularly vulnerable

55
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,639
communities linked to for example

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,220
critical infrastructure so that also

57
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,800
helps us to to gain primary evidence

58
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,739
about how cyber incidence is cyber

59
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:18,239
threats are affecting particularly

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,700
vulnerable communities and then we

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,120
analyze that as a lot or in also along

62
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,239
with open source intelligence that we

63
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,599
can we gather and aggregate from a broad

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:33,959
variety of of actors and and

65
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,720
um means of collecting data that we can

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,840
really then look at analyzing along with

67
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,540
that primary evidence how cyber threat

68
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,160
landscape is affecting particularly

69
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,400
vulnerable communities and then we use

70
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,879
those insights to inform policy and

71
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,700
legal discussions that are happening for

72
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,760
example at the United Nations to build

73
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,580
um a more stronger normative framework

74
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,040
for the use of icts or against cyber

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,560
criminality so there are several ongoing

76
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,900
processes at the UN and in other foreign

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,140
the osc and others that are developing

78
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,739
Norms to strengthen the protections of

79
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,959
against the Cyber criminality or the

80
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,780
protections of the use of icts so we

81
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,120
work in this holistic way to really try

82
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,120
to use this evidence to have an advocacy

83
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,400
and policy-based approach to try to

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,659
effect change

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,159
why are we interested in harm I think

86
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,860
the critical aspect around that is that

87
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,060
the current Focus around harm primarily

88
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,340
is linked to the operational or

89
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,659
financial downtime and impact of a Cyber

90
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:46,799
attack

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,799
and all the public reporting obligations

92
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,560
that are required in certain in certain

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,599
sectors or in certain countries and that

94
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,519
differs across sector and differs across

95
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,980
country and so it really is focused on

96
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,780
what's the time to restore what are the

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,480
financial costs or penalties what's the

98
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,340
number of records that are breached what

99
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,080
is the personal identifiable information

100
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,959
which has been accessed

101
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,060
um what is not really for the focus

102
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,340
currently is what's the harm that has

103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,040
actually caused to people and because

104
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,959
there's really no standard methodology

105
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,940
in place that makes it very hard to

106
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,520
understand those harms and without a

107
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,620
lack of real metrics tools and

108
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,900
Frameworks to understand and track that

109
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,900
harm over time it's very difficult to

110
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:34,380
then work at how we can build stronger

111
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,500
um normative and policy making processes

112
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
reflecting that harm how we can better

113
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,360
support the victims of of cyber

114
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,180
incidences and how we can learn for that

115
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,340
in terms of building Greater greater

116
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,000
resilience so that's what drove us to

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,180
look at why measuring harm is important

118
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,759
so that we can then use that in that

119
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:58,979
cycle that I mentioned uh in the slide

120
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,600
previously around assisting those

121
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,780
communities analyzing the attack through

122
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,660
a more methodological process and then

123
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:09,120
using that to inform uh diplomatic

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,560
processes at state level

125
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,340
thanks Charlotte so trying to put a bit

126
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,740
of an analogy into place and how to

127
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,780
actually differentiate a little a little

128
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,419
bit what we mean by the terms impact and

129
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,680
the terms harm

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,620
and I want here to use the notion of a

131
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,720
car accident we all know what a car

132
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
accident is it's an impact between two

133
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,680
vehicles

134
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,919
a car accident can have different

135
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,180
impacts it can have an operational

136
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,880
disruption it can increase traffic at a

137
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:45,180
particular time of day and it can lead

138
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,479
to to delays in you getting to work and

139
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,479
it can lead to disruptions to services

140
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,120
that have to intervene to be able to

141
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,400
um to resolve the accident

142
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
we've got Financial costs and costs that

143
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,020
really are impacting potentially both

144
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,139
persons are both drivers of the car and

145
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:05,940
in terms of the insurance that they have

146
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,580
to pay and things of this nature

147
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,919
then we look at the physical damage to

148
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:12,720
the vehicles what has actually happened

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,600
in terms of an actual damage to the

150
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
windscreen or to the to the wheels and

151
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,160
then we have such things as geotemporal

152
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,680
factors how long did the accident Cause

153
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,280
A disruption how big of an area did that

154
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,319
um did that accident actually

155
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,900
um lead to further disruptions

156
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:34,139
if we then look at the harm components

157
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:36,840
of that car accident we come at it from

158
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,699
a human-centric approach and we're

159
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,440
looking at what was the physical harm

160
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,440
that was caused to either the drivers or

161
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,180
the passengers in the car or the

162
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,800
bystanders who might have actually

163
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,380
witnessed that accident what does that

164
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,539
mean in terms of potential psychological

165
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:54,000
impact to the driver who might not be

166
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,560
able to drive that car then for a

167
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,600
subsequent lengthy period of time

168
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,819
we look at the community and societal

169
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,400
impact how an entire family has passed

170
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,380
away as a result of an accident and how

171
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,180
that impacts the community

172
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,280
we look at the reputational damage that

173
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,020
could come from that if the vehicle was

174
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,180
a company a truck for example an Amazon

175
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,419
vehicle that is then involved in an

176
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,979
accident what what might be the result

177
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,080
from that and then with a look at the

178
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,120
environmental impact with Zone oil spill

179
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,500
on the road how did that impact the

180
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,000
environment around it

181
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,520
if we take that example and we sort of

182
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,240
pivot that onto a Cyber attack we can

183
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,699
see similar divisions so if we take an

184
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:36,419
example of an attack on a hospital what

185
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:38,639
is the operational disruption to that

186
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,560
Hospital's ability to deliver Services

187
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,900
have the computer systems gone offline

188
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,360
has the website gone offline is it

189
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,759
impeding the automatic opening of doors

190
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
for example what is the financial cost

191
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,139
of that hospital to actually recover

192
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,419
from the Cyber attack or to actually

193
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:56,340
respond to the Cyber attack in the first

194
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,099
place what is the physical damage that

195
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,259
has occurred in terms of physical damage

196
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,419
to the actual infrastructure the

197
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,860
technical infrastructure that was in

198
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,139
place and then how long did that attack

199
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,599
go on for how long were operations

200
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,539
disrupted did it affect One hospital did

201
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:14,460
it affect 50 different hospitals against

202
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,380
50 different states for example in the

203
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,819
US because they're part of a wider

204
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:18,960
Network

205
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,120
and then we look at the harm and we look

206
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,280
again from a human angle from the

207
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,620
people's angle and here it's not just

208
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,660
the patients who are affected it is the

209
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,039
healthcare professionals who are

210
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,259
operating within that hospital who are

211
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,539
having to react in circumstances where

212
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,219
they don't have access to Patient data

213
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,659
where they don't have access to

214
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,339
computers where they don't have access

215
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:40,500
to imagery for example

216
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,179
and what are the physical or

217
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,399
psychological effects of those

218
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,100
particular that particular Cyber attack

219
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,560
and the delays that it's caused in terms

220
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,320
of access to and to Patient Care

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,760
and then there's the community and

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,740
societal implications surrounding that

223
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:58,019
has the hospital has to divert patients

224
00:08:58,019 --> 00:08:59,700
to another hospital so it's causing a

225
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,240
knock-on effect within a geographical

226
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,279
perimeter of a city for example what is

227
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,740
the reputational impact when critical

228
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,080
data is leaked from a hospital and

229
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,279
patient records are made available

230
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
online and what is the environmental

231
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,620
impact if we take something perhaps a

232
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,200
bit easier to imagine here is a Cyber

233
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,820
attack on a water facility and

234
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,220
contamination resulting from that you

235
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,080
know what what broader implications does

236
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,380
that have

237
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,019
so taking in mind this kind of notion of

238
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:32,640
impact and harm

239
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
um we then started to look at what

240
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,240
actually exists today what are some of

241
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,160
the literature some of the studies and

242
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
some of the work that is being done by

243
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,820
different actors multi-stakeholder

244
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,120
actors looking at impact and harm

245
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,860
so we've got a report that was published

246
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,200
by the icrc for example that really

247
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,360
looked at the effects of cyber

248
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,940
operations in times of armed conflict so

249
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,580
it's a very specific and it's a very

250
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,800
specific use case relating to cyber

251
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,500
operations and they're really looking at

252
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,959
an assessment of how traditional Notions

253
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:06,600
of impact actually rely on a risk

254
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,480
assessment and they look at a comparison

255
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,279
of the likelihood of an attack taking

256
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,519
place and the severity of those events

257
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,620
so in terms of severity they're looking

258
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,019
at the type of of effects of an attack

259
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,000
they're looking at the scale in terms of

260
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,560
the people that are affected or the

261
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,140
number of computers that might have been

262
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,060
affected as well as the duration but

263
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,320
then they actually look at the

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,420
likelihood and what is the probability

265
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,240
that a certain cyber operation actually

266
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,060
causes the effects and that they're

267
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,700
setting in the severity component and

268
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,040
not just looking at the likelihood of

269
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,860
that happening to an intended target but

270
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,320
it could also be a an impact that is

271
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
happening

272
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,160
incidentally or accidentally in the

273
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,540
context of a cyber incident

274
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,940
what else exists today there's a number

275
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,880
of different uh companies notably in the

276
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
private sector that are looking really

277
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,079
at the business impact and these are

278
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,760
coming from the likes of Deloitte but

279
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,140
there's also insurance companies that

280
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,399
have been doing a lot of work on this

281
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,079
that are actually looking at the

282
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,019
business impact so what is the impact

283
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,480
for example of a technical investigation

284
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,760
that has to result as a um that results

285
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,519
following a Cyber attack

286
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:22,200
um how does it affect public relations

287
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,600
for the company

288
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
um how are my insurance premiums going

289
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,980
to change next year as a result of the

290
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,600
fact that I've been a victim of a Cyber

291
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,040
attack and I've had to claim of that

292
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,540
insurance

293
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,579
have I lost any intellectual property

294
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,740
when the Cyber attack has taken place

295
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,380
but what we see in this report is these

296
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,260
kinds of reporters are significant and a

297
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,640
lack of

298
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,380
um acknowledgment that actually the

299
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,060
Cyber attack beyond the organizational

300
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,820
impact is actually the the impact that

301
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,959
that has had on people be it for example

302
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,700
their own employees or be it their

303
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,800
customers who who might have suffered as

304
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
a result

305
00:12:01,339 --> 00:12:04,740
then we looked at a report published by

306
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,440
unidea which is actually a bit broadened

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,279
looking at the impact and the impact and

308
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,600
harm of cyber attacks but it actually

309
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,480
looks at the taxonomy of malicious cyber

310
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,560
incidents

311
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,240
but there's a couple of components of

312
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,040
that taxonomy that are actually really

313
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,800
interesting when you look at the victim

314
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,779
profile where they talk about whether a

315
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,240
victim is intended instrumental or

316
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,980
collateral

317
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,320
um they they also break down the victim

318
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,240
into different components the victims

319
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,060
can be an organization but it can also

320
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,920
be an individual within that

321
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,620
organization or in and of its own right

322
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,959
if we think about for example a

323
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,760
individual whose phone has been targeted

324
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,760
by spyware that individual themselves is

325
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
actually a victim of a Cyber attack

326
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,380
they also break it down into what is

327
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,720
critical infrastructure as a victim what

328
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,579
is a country as a victim and you know

329
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,560
we'll address the sir where we go on to

330
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,420
the topic of Ukraine later on in the

331
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,000
presentation and then it looks also at

332
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,279
International systems in place

333
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,500
but it also breaks down things such as

334
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,420
targeted assets

335
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,279
um and on the other Spectrum in terms of

336
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,620
the output what happens post Cyber

337
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,959
attack and they break it down into the

338
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,579
effects which is what we're calling

339
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:19,680
impact on our side but it also looks at

340
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,540
the harm where it's broken it down into

341
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,200
physical psychological Economic Times

342
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,360
um but it also looks at gains which is a

343
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
really interesting

344
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,600
um aspect of it which is looking what

345
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,820
has the threat actor actually gained

346
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,339
from committing that Cyber attack and

347
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,320
for us it's asking questions of can that

348
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,300
actually be transformed into some kind

349
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,480
of measures of impact as well if if the

350
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,399
um if the objective of the threat actor

351
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,740
is of a particular nature and he manages

352
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,480
to gain something from the Cyber attack

353
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,040
what does that mean in terms of

354
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,420
assessing whether there's been a

355
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,120
particular impact or harm

356
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,820
then the academic world we've been doing

357
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,320
quite a bit of digging into this and

358
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,940
they've actually started to propose some

359
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,160
taxonomies or classifications of harms

360
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,500
and these this particular study here

361
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,899
breaks it down into physical

362
00:14:05,899 --> 00:14:08,639
psychological emotional economic

363
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,820
political governmental reputational and

364
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,639
cultural components and these come

365
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,160
together and they actually reuse quite

366
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,320
regularly Now by different uh different

367
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,760
stakeholders and across different

368
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,800
sectors in terms of actually used as

369
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,079
classification of harms but there's some

370
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,360
open questions here can we talk about

371
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,579
community and societal harm is that

372
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:30,839
something different from the

373
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:32,579
classifications that have been put in

374
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,339
here can we talk about the

375
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,019
disproportionality of harms for example

376
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:38,459
when we're talking about particular

377
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:41,040
communities targeted through cyber

378
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
attacks if we if we're looking at

379
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,060
gender-based targeting for example how

380
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,100
is that taken into consideration in in

381
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,779
the existing Frameworks that have been

382
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,000
put forward what about environmental

383
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,279
that doesn't seem to quite feature that

384
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,100
yet is it coming under economic is it

385
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,680
coming under cultural perhaps

386
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,300
um and then there's some fundamental

387
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,540
questions how do we actually access and

388
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,760
collect data to be able to understand

389
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,519
this harm it's difficult and that data

390
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,560
is not so easy to collect and we're

391
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,638
going to go through that in a minute

392
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,279
so the healthcare sector so we've

393
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,800
touched on an example earlier and the

394
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,959
the particular visuals here are on the

395
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:23,519
two sides if we imagine the car

396
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,740
accidents we've got on the left the

397
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,480
hospital fighting the Cyber threat

398
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:30,060
actors it is the operational disruption

399
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,160
what is being done to actually contain

400
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,959
that incident to actually try to

401
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,699
minimize the impact of that incident

402
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,620
over time and then on the right hand

403
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,260
side we see what's happening to the

404
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,399
patients and to the healthcare

405
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,380
professionals who are operating with

406
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,019
systems that are being disrupted or data

407
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,139
being exfiltrated related to Patient

408
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:51,019
sensitive patient information

409
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:55,079
so since um June 2020 The cyberpiece

410
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,399
Institute we've been collecting and

411
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,019
documenting cyber attacks against

412
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,180
organizations in the healthcare sector

413
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,459
across the world and we're doing this

414
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,079
through open source data collection and

415
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,820
we've been focusing predominantly on

416
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,860
disruptive cyber attacks so notably

417
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,800
ransomware and we've documented up until

418
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,820
September last year 501 incidents

419
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,019
specifically disruptive attacks against

420
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,420
the healthcare sector that's across 43

421
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,880
different countries it's an average of

422
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,480
4.1 attacks a week and that is barely

423
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,699
scratching the surface this is what we

424
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:28,560
publicly know about

425
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,480
so what we decided to do when we were

426
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,980
collecting this data is how do we

427
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,899
actually start to Define indicators to

428
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,880
actually measure the harm and impact

429
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,860
that these cyber attacks are having

430
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,079
and we're looking at Global numbers such

431
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,800
as 21 21 million records breached we're

432
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,639
looking at uh 1 400 Days of disruption

433
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,860
in total and again this is just what is

434
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,000
actually known in terms of those

435
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,639
incidents

436
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,440
so what were we able to actually capture

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,720
from our data sets we were able to

438
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,360
capture from what is known so there's a

439
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,160
big question mark at the bottom of this

440
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,559
of this slide it is what about the

441
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,059
unknowns and there are a large

442
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,559
proportion of the incidents that we've

443
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,359
documented for which there's no publicly

444
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,220
available information on the impact at

445
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,660
harm that they cause

446
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,079
but on average 163 000 records are

447
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,359
breached and enjoying a cyber incident

448
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,220
on the healthcare sector

449
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,059
in 13 of cases incidents resulted in

450
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,980
patients being redirected from the

451
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,760
facility that they were in and in 15

452
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,540
incidents resulted in canceled

453
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,880
appointments this is significant when we

454
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,200
think about the number of people that

455
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
would have been using those services and

456
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,620
those resources uh during the time of

457
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,760
the Cyber attack

458
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,320
and then we look at the organizational

459
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,559
side 19 days on average of operational

460
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,020
impact on that hospital or that

461
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,940
Healthcare organization's capacity to

462
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,559
deliver its services

463
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:52,260
52 of incidents led to Healthcare

464
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,120
Systems going offline which means in

465
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,860
limited access to certain types of

466
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,600
information certain types of tools

467
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,600
during a cyber incident and in 70

468
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,280
percent of those cases we're talking

469
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,679
about disruptive incidence here in 70 of

470
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:09,080
those cases data was exposed Elite

471
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,299
what can we draw from qualitative

472
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,980
information so there we were looking at

473
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,600
the quantitative aspects what can we

474
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
numerically calculate what is the

475
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,919
qualitative data saying so I'm not going

476
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,539
to necessarily read through all of this

477
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,039
but I wanted to pick up some key words

478
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,020
in the slide here this is a real case

479
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,940
example of a Cyber attack against a

480
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,620
hospital in France in August of last

481
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,880
year

482
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,360
medical images devices went down patient

483
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,400
admissions were inaccessible seven

484
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,380
hundred thousand people used that

485
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,600
particular hospital they were unable to

486
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,580
register new patients there was

487
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,280
redirection to nearby hospitals there

488
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,799
were precautionary measures that were

489
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,520
taken to transfer infants in intensive

490
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,860
care precautionary measures they didn't

491
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,419
even know if the Cyber attack would

492
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:55,860
impact the ability for that child to

493
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,600
receive care but they had to take the

494
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,760
precautions to do so how do we start to

495
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,580
measure these things there was Emergency

496
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,440
Care intake was decreased by more than

497
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,820
half

498
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,160
um certain patients couldn't be operated

499
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,000
on

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,280
there were 11 gigabytes of confidential

501
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,140
data that made it online that included

502
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,760
scans lab results and Social Security

503
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,620
numbers let's have a think for a moment

504
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,960
what that actually means that's one of

505
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,419
those 501 incidents

506
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:24,320
in other space

507
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,500
who in this room has actually heard of

508
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,039
estamo

509
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,799
I'm hoping by the end of today you're

510
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,120
going to remember them

511
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,820
their Psychotherapy Clinic that's based

512
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,900
in Finland

513
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,260
and they were targeted in a system

514
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,960
breach back in November 2018 which was

515
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,580
followed up by another one in 2019.

516
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,200
attackers came back only in September

517
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,480
2020. uh contacting the starmo

518
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,299
requesting 40 Bitcoins to be able to

519
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,039
protect that data so it doesn't get

520
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,840
leaked online

521
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,580
they refused

522
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,340
and what happened subsequently was the

523
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,740
actual targeting of specific patients

524
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,160
who were requested to pay 500 euros for

525
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,760
their data not to feature online

526
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,460
this resulted investamo actually having

527
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,539
to declare bankruptcy in February 2021.

528
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:26,400
staff and patients had to be transferred

529
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,080
to new services

530
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,320
they were fined post bankruptcy by the

531
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,940
finished data protection authority for

532
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,340
violation of gdpr

533
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,440
and then there was a suspect that was

534
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,020
named in October 2022

535
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,500
and they were arrested in February 2023.

536
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,380
that arrest is extremely rare in terms

537
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,059
of cyber investigations

538
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,460
the accountability aspect which Charlie

539
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,960
will touch upon later is actually

540
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,660
extremely rare that a cyber incident

541
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,160
actually results in somebody being

542
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,360
arrested

543
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,360
but this case had a significant impact

544
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,720
on the finished Healthcare sector on the

545
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,360
Finnish government who had to revisit a

546
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,919
whole number of different aspects of the

547
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,480
way that they were protecting patient

548
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,620
data

549
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,539
all the way to going through to new

550
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:14,880
systems to actually allow for their

551
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,679
citizens to actually have new identity

552
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:18,299
numbers in the aftermath of a

553
00:21:18,299 --> 00:21:20,840
significant attack

554
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:22,919
so we've taken these kind of case

555
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:24,660
studies as part of building a

556
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,299
methodology where we actually break it

557
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:29,400
down break down the incidents into

558
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,080
different categories such as

559
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,480
geographical societal operational human

560
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,940
and legal impacts of cyber attacks I

561
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,320
won't go through the details just for

562
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,299
the sake of time

563
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,900
so our methodology then is taking up the

564
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,419
notion of identifying indicators of harm

565
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,220
based on the quantitative and

566
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,659
qualitative data collection that we're

567
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:49,440
doing

568
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
and we break this down into uh into

569
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,080
different columns or categories of harm

570
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,659
that could be applicable to any Cyber

571
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,520
attack no matter what sector what domain

572
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,740
what type of Cyber attack it is to

573
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,780
indicators that are sector specific so

574
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,880
for example the healthcare sector and

575
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,159
then indicators that are attack specific

576
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,020
such as the notion of ransomware a

577
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,340
ransom paid is only going to be

578
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,659
applicable in the context of a

579
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:13,919
ransomware attack

580
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,799
and what we're then doing is identifying

581
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,320
different weightings of indicators based

582
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,480
on and those Notions of harm that we've

583
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,940
identified so we're looking here at Raw

584
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,679
numeric values that we could use as part

585
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,600
of a future formula

586
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,600
we then also use categorical indicators

587
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,600
so here we mean we're transforming what

588
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,400
would be potentially a yes or no answer

589
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,039
to a question or a category for example

590
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,780
whether an incident is actually

591
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:42,360
confirmed or possible and you know what

592
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,820
weight does that particular category or

593
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,799
value then hold converting that into a

594
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,120
numerical value

595
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,159
and the next step and this is where the

596
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,600
methodology is working progress and

597
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,000
where we want to engage the community is

598
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,799
to actually figure out how do we

599
00:22:55,799 --> 00:22:57,539
mathematically combine these different

600
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,640
indicators together to be able to

601
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,159
compare incidents one against the other

602
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,799
in terms of the impact and harm that

603
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,220
they've had

604
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:09,840
there's also complexities with regards

605
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,460
to this and we mentioned this earlier is

606
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,220
how do we actually access the data and

607
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,960
if we're looking at certain things like

608
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,480
the geographical impacts of a Cyber

609
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,000
attack the likelihood of us being able

610
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,860
to acquire that data is actually very

611
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,080
high but then if we're looking at things

612
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,880
like psychological harm it's actually

613
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,039
quite low how do we go about actually

614
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,020
collecting the psychological harm that's

615
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,480
resulted from a Cyber attack

616
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,860
so these are just some of the

617
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,179
complexities and things that we're

618
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:38,600
thinking about

619
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,460
I'll whiz through the work that we're

620
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,100
doing on Ukraine so since the beginning

621
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:47,280
of uh last year so in the in the month

622
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,740
leading up to the invasion

623
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,720
um we started to document cyber attacks

624
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,460
and operations in the context of the

625
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,080
armed conflict

626
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,360
and to date we've documented a thousand

627
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,280
three hundred and thirty cyber attacks

628
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,600
that have happened either against

629
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,179
organizations in Ukraine organizations

630
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:04,980
in the Russian Federation or

631
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,720
organizations

632
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,159
um outside of the two belligerent

633
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,320
countries that that are taking place in

634
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,760
the context of the war

635
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,260
and so here we're back to some

636
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,059
quantitative numbers we're looking at

637
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:18,000
roughly 21 attacks a week 87 different

638
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,340
threat actors 23 sectors impacted 45

639
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:22,440
countries but what we're starting to

640
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,020
look at is how does the aggregation of

641
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,539
these different cyber attacks together

642
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:29,460
actually cause harm in itself

643
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,520
what is happening in terms of the

644
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,520
persistent need for organizations to

645
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,580
defend themselves and the fact that you

646
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:40,620
they are operating an environment where

647
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,960
they actually have to expect to be

648
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,900
attacked and how how is that impacting

649
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,760
their ability to operate in terms of

650
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,580
persistence persistent defense

651
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,400
we've looked at also some of the um the

652
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,260
qualitative aspects of what it means

653
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,480
when organizations are targeted within

654
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,940
certain sectors so the energy sector for

655
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,380
example what is happening when the

656
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,480
electricity goes down what is happening

657
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,600
in the financial sector when um when we

658
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,100
have cash machines that are not

659
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,360
available for people to be able to

660
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,740
withdraw their money

661
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,539
what is happening in the context of the

662
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:14,520
media and when we talk about the media

663
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,860
we're really talking about the uh the

664
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,440
impacting of informational space and how

665
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,120
um the information narrative is actually

666
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,799
being skewed in the context of the

667
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:23,640
conflict

668
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,380
and then Transportation what is

669
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,820
happening when certain Transportation

670
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,980
networks can't operate or when when

671
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,419
their customers can't buy their tickets

672
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,640
to be able to to to to take the

673
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,440
transport Networks

674
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,240
because I've covered all of this so I

675
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,740
will move on so why is if we look at

676
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,440
something like the contact of in context

677
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,179
of Ukraine or the healthcare or the

678
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:46,980
humanitarian sector why is it important

679
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,919
to measure these harms and what we see

680
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,059
is that it is partly about busting

681
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,960
preconceptions if you look at something

682
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,179
like the war in Ukraine people will say

683
00:25:57,179 --> 00:25:58,679
that war is happening between Ukraine

684
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:00,779
and Russia but we've monitored attacks

685
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:03,059
happening in 45 other countries and

686
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:06,000
those attacks are countries that are not

687
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,120
necessarily involved in the conflict but

688
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,620
they may have made a statement for

689
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,720
example that they have stated that they

690
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,000
believe that you had that the sanctions

691
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,620
should apply

692
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,400
um to to Russia for its illegal

693
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,320
annexation or occupation of Ukraine and

694
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,840
then immediately you see cyber attacks

695
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,760
starting to happen so even if you are

696
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,340
not involved in in that conflict as a

697
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,500
belligerent country or as an

698
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,240
organization that is involved in any way

699
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,400
shape or form your still becoming

700
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,740
vulnerable so it is important to bust

701
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,740
some of those preconceptions about who's

702
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,440
affected but also how people things are

703
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,059
affected it's not just about financial

704
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:47,279
shutdown it's not just about

705
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,220
um operational downtime

706
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,860
it is also important to use that in

707
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,159
normative discussions so there are

708
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,620
ongoing at the moment un negotiations

709
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,080
around cyber crime for a new convention

710
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,659
and on the open-ended working group

711
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:06,299
which sits in New York to discuss the

712
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,120
use of icts where there have been

713
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,279
discussions ongoing for many years to

714
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,740
develop normative framework the Norms

715
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,020
that should

716
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,419
ensure the appropriate use of of

717
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:21,559
technology or the the appropriate

718
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:24,419
responsibilities in relation to to cyber

719
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:25,620
crime

720
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,260
what we find in those discussions have

721
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,840
started to have been really looking at

722
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,820
actually undermining some of the

723
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,559
existing protections that are there

724
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,960
because of the negotiation stance of

725
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
certain countries who are actually

726
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,700
informing those processes and saying

727
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:45,000
well look it's not an Attack under in

728
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,100
Ukraine unless there's actually been any

729
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:50,039
harm and because it's only a temporary

730
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:51,779
shutdown of a system there's no harm

731
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,419
Ergo it's not an attack well if you're

732
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,940
only measuring harm in a very limited

733
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,179
way then there is a risk that those

734
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,080
normative discussions end up developing

735
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,480
policies and Norms that we should be

736
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,059
following which actually do not reflect

737
00:28:09,059 --> 00:28:11,220
at all the operating environment with

738
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,659
which we're in

739
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,640
it's also how do we look at reducing

740
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,400
impact and increase accountability

741
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:20,039
because uh for victims of cyber attacks

742
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,340
how do they go about understanding how

743
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,900
they've been affected communicating how

744
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,120
they've been affected knowing what

745
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,460
redress that they may have whether

746
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,320
that's at an individual level or a state

747
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,659
level for for example criminal

748
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,700
prosecutions that might come and we see

749
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,039
a lot of the threat actors today for

750
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:39,840
example in Ukraine there's been a lot of

751
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,940
self-attribution if you see that on the

752
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,520
slide that Emma showed before many

753
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,440
different more than 80 threat actors

754
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,960
many of which have self-attributed and

755
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,940
said we have carried out the attack so

756
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,740
if we can manage measure the harm that's

757
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,960
been linked to that and then look at the

758
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,720
impact really of of that Cyber attack

759
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,100
that could lead to a prosecution either

760
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,179
domestically in the country where the

761
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:04,679
attack has happened to also at an

762
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,539
international level so those things are

763
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,039
going to be very important to understand

764
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:10,919
and actually be able to frame what those

765
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,179
harms mean

766
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:14,460
uh increasing public awareness is

767
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,860
critical because we've we hear a lot

768
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,320
about it's not just when it's if a Cyber

769
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,419
attack happens but people don't

770
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,039
necessarily understand what that will

771
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,679
mean for them and so if we can raise the

772
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,960
public awareness about all of the things

773
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,700
that we were just discussing earlier

774
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,100
then it will really help to to bust some

775
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,779
of those myths and actually have a

776
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,820
greater recognition of what harms and

777
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,140
impacts are

778
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,120
we're also moving into an environment

779
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,700
where cyber risks are increasing and

780
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:43,940
there is a permissiveness around

781
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,620
accountability for those attacks that

782
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,480
are happening it's allowing uh

783
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,580
perpetrators of those violations to

784
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,799
continue to not be brought to Justice or

785
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,679
or to um to create an environment where

786
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,240
attackers feel they won't be held

787
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,320
accountable

788
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,980
if we can frame better the harms and

789
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,039
impacts it is clear that these are not

790
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,840
victimless crimes they're not computer

791
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,640
crimes they're not crimes they happen

792
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,799
just about technology they are affecting

793
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,720
people I think that is very very

794
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,520
important particularly for decision

795
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,340
makers who are framing policies and laws

796
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,220
today and in the future and it will help

797
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,960
they'll contribute to improved stability

798
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,779
in cyberspace because there's a growing

799
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:27,299
distrust in the use of of Technology the

800
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,640
fear that our phones spy on us or that

801
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,100
we shouldn't go online or because of of

802
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,799
of the risks to us or that certain

803
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,440
technology is a worry and so or

804
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,080
countries worrying about back doors to

805
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,440
use certain technology so understanding

806
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,659
harms and impacts and being able to use

807
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:48,120
that to frame the the

808
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,039
um the public awareness the policy

809
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:51,659
decisions and hopefully greater

810
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:54,059
accountability can all lead to improved

811
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,279
stability in cyberspace

812
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:58,559
and then there are some wider broader

813
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,299
implications that we have to look at so

814
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:02,039
I mentioned you know there is a lack of

815
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,200
accountability there is this changing

816
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,659
normative environment the regulatory

817
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:09,659
environment is changing quite quickly

818
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,059
dependent on our different regions or

819
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,700
different countries but where you do

820
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,520
have to report like for uh on gdpr for

821
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,220
data breaches uh where there are high

822
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,240
fines

823
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,159
um for those organizations that haven't

824
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,980
reported breaches or on attacks on the

825
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,960
healthcare sector for example in in the

826
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,659
US where you have to to report on those

827
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:33,659
above a sudden threshold all of the

828
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:35,520
implications of those

829
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,820
um that more tied to regulations and

830
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,799
then compliance with those regulations

831
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,679
will need also an increased awareness of

832
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,720
what the harm is

833
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,700
um we know the risk of attack is high

834
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,500
can we reduce the impact if we

835
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
understand more what the impact is

836
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,240
um and then there's also the wider sort

837
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,220
of sense of of trust in technology

838
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,279
energy if you look at the the fear or

839
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:01,620
the the awareness around cryptocurrency

840
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,600
and the perception that that's the the

841
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,399
the currency of choice if you're going

842
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,620
to carry out a ransomware you know that

843
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,919
also great builds um or prejudices

844
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,679
certain technology and and that's also a

845
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,779
risk for for society and risk for for

846
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:18,059
technology and then look at the enormous

847
00:32:18,059 --> 00:32:20,460
costs that organizations and individuals

848
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:24,440
are having to to to deploy in order to

849
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,779
prevent cyber incidences defend against

850
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,880
them and respond in terms of our own

851
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,039
capabilities inside to build a more

852
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:34,919
resilient organization and all of those

853
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:37,980
are the broader implications of of the

854
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,840
recognition of the harms and impacts

855
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,880
which go far beyond those which are just

856
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,620
the risk to the organization of its

857
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,520
Financial

858
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,460
um or operational shutdown

859
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,860
to conclude therefore we've been working

860
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,500
on this methodology we are now engaging

861
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,840
with the wider Community cyber Security

862
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,779
Experts governments International

863
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:00,240
organizations the private sector other

864
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,580
civil society organizations Academia

865
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,340
Insurance to really look take the

866
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,440
methodology that we've been working on I

867
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,120
think the questions that are still there

868
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,880
and then work with this with the

869
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,159
community to really try to to look at

870
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,019
how we can reinforce this methodology

871
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,720
how we can build on this methodology how

872
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,640
we can strengthen it around the data

873
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,440
collection around the identification of

874
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,080
indicators measuring over time or

875
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,779
measuring different types of attacks

876
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,240
with a view of then looking at also how

877
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,039
would we be able to make this

878
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,899
methodology something that does become a

879
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:36,120
reference point so over the next months

880
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,399
we we are engaging with different actors

881
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,919
across at different sectors and we're

882
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,360
very interested to have any feedback

883
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,419
that you may have on on this work and

884
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:47,039
with that we will then also obviously

885
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,720
clearly be making this methodology

886
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,019
public later in the year so thank you

887
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:54,000
very much for for your attention and

888
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,940
we're open for any questions thank you

889
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:03,539
[Applause]

890
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:07,940
please raise your end for questions

891
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:14,460
hi thank you

892
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,040
um I am a big fan of trying to

893
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,239
understand

894
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,280
impact and harm sorry those terms are a

895
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,139
little bit uh close to one another right

896
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:24,060
so I might not use them the same way

897
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,219
that you do at the same time I'm trying

898
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,480
to figure out

899
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,399
um who's the primary audience of this

900
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:31,379
message are you trying to convince

901
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:34,080
policyholders to to implement this

902
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,399
framework are you trying to convince

903
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,800
industry are you trying to come up with

904
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,679
a new vocabulary for ngos to use can you

905
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,300
help me understand where this fits in

906
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:47,639
suddenly the the big gap today is that

907
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,260
we all talk about these things in very

908
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,760
different ways and I think that's a

909
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,080
challenge particularly when we're trying

910
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,899
to inform both victims of of those

911
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:56,820
attacks which is primarily for us the

912
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,560
the humanitarian sector Health sector

913
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,080
critical infrastructure sector but also

914
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,640
states that are making

915
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,980
um decisions about this and are

916
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,500
influencing or the only ones who can

917
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,980
really take positions uh at in these U.S

918
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,359
fora

919
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,160
um about what these harms and impacts

920
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,619
are because that will help inform those

921
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,359
policy decisions so definitely at a

922
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:19,980
state level it's very important and we

923
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,020
see and the feedback we get is there's a

924
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,119
big gap for them in this regard and they

925
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,339
would like contributions that can come

926
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:30,359
but Civil Society organization like we

927
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:31,859
can't and shouldn't be doing this alone

928
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:34,020
we should be engaging with all the

929
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,520
different actors that can help inform

930
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,680
that but also can build on work that's

931
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,440
already been done so I think our appeal

932
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,359
is really to have a wider sense of

933
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,359
Engagement from different actors so that

934
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,520
it can then be used as a as a

935
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,200
methodology which is going to help

936
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,359
particularly in in decision making and

937
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,400
for stability

938
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,579
Emma and just a touch also on the notion

939
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:59,040
of the the ngos and the non-profit

940
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,780
organizations that we're supporting as

941
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,400
part of our assistant services at the

942
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,380
Cyber peace Institute it's actually

943
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:07,079
there is still a lack of awareness of

944
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:09,000
what a cyber security incident can

945
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,560
actually do to your operational

946
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,440
activities this is happening every day

947
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,200
and it seems to be let's react post the

948
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,240
major incidents so to be able to

949
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,880
actually measure that impact and harm in

950
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,880
a way that is more tangible and the idea

951
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,680
is to raise that awareness to get people

952
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,359
to think about how they actually

953
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,940
increase their cyber security resilience

954
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,119
and to be able to to reduce the impact

955
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,160
of a Cyber attack we can't prevent every

956
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
Cyber attack from taking place but we

957
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,640
can certainly raise the awareness for

958
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,320
them that for the need for them to

959
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,420
actually act before it's too late

960
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,980
and to build and I think one of the

961
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,079
organizations we've helped quite a

962
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,339
number of organizations that have been

963
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:48,720
going through cyber attacks

964
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,339
interestingly they came back and said

965
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:52,260
even after the attack was over and they

966
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,020
had whether it was a a fraud or whether

967
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,160
it was

968
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,440
um a breach into their systems and

969
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,000
interference and disruption of their

970
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,320
systems looking about said the

971
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,960
psychological impact has gone on far far

972
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,200
longer than the actual recovery and that

973
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,240
that was completely underestimated they

974
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,640
didn't and they needed to also use that

975
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,619
sort of information to help inform and

976
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:15,599
support the staff as they were going

977
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,599
forward not just then to to have process

978
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:20,700
in place to build a better resilience to

979
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,160
that but also looking and saying wow how

980
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,320
do we overcome that how do we manage

981
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:27,359
that and a lot of the the leadership of

982
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,740
those organizations which are often

983
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,960
being targeted to say we are not armed

984
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,599
to be able to do that at all so I think

985
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,400
on many different levels we can we can

986
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,040
play this but I think for the

987
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:39,660
organizations themselves also to realize

988
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,220
it's normal to have an enormous

989
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,500
psychological impact of an attack that

990
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,000
would be part of it and that is an

991
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,359
impact or harm that's really important

992
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:50,960
thank you

993
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,020
hi uh thanks for the talk um

994
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,240
so I fully agree with the message that

995
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,099
you're trying to conveying about the

996
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:08,160
importance of measuring harm though in

997
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,079
my experience every time we try to

998
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,320
propose like a policy change the people

999
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,960
in charge ask for sort of a real

1000
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,619
measurable number uh like you you seem

1001
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:21,780
to agree with this do you have any sort

1002
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,400
of advice or a preferred framework to

1003
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,520
attach a number to you know the

1004
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,800
predicted harm cost

1005
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,560
uh thank you for prediction or foreign

1006
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,940
is the notion that what is a matter and

1007
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,520
that measure can be a numerical measure

1008
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,339
a quantitative value like it can be a

1009
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:52,859
qualitative one and sometimes the

1010
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:54,839
message that is clearest to get through

1011
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,240
is what qualitative information is

1012
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,099
actually telling us and it's converting

1013
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:00,660
that qualitative information into

1014
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,540
something that people relate to and so

1015
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,280
so the way that we are really

1016
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,140
constructing this from our perspective

1017
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:09,060
is to say we need to pull on many things

1018
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,040
we need to pull on the fact that there's

1019
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,380
a financial cost to an organization yes

1020
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,839
that's going to make the CEO wake up but

1021
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,700
there are going to be other components

1022
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,800
where we're gonna be able to say to an

1023
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,200
organization if there is a Cyber attack

1024
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,720
that's happened on a hospital and you

1025
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,400
have five doctors that are going to be

1026
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,140
unavailable for the next four weeks

1027
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,900
because they are so traumatized by what

1028
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,280
has happened and the fact that they

1029
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,579
haven't been able to deal with emergency

1030
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,440
emergency care patients that is

1031
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,940
something that should should speak to

1032
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,300
many people and I think actually by by

1033
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,180
using the business impact so so the part

1034
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,920
that I was talking about the the really

1035
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,740
the organizational impact of harm we're

1036
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,960
so removing it from the human impact

1037
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,760
that actually is difficult for us as

1038
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,560
humans as individuals as people to

1039
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,900
relate to so it's so I don't know if

1040
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,040
that answers your your question

1041
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
specifically with Charlotte yeah and I

1042
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,220
think we we looked at the healthcare

1043
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,740
sector for example and we brought uh we

1044
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:07,079
we ran as a process of multi-stakeholder

1045
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:09,300
uh engagement where we put in the room

1046
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,760
cyber Security Experts we put into those

1047
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,380
responsible for hospitals the

1048
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,420
administration Finance we put

1049
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,800
governments we put Civil Society

1050
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,900
International organizations and what was

1051
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,579
very interesting would say hey they're

1052
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:21,960
all speaking very different languages

1053
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:24,960
there's very little engagement and those

1054
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,420
that we were um that we brought together

1055
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,880
with actually the those who were making

1056
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,700
decisions about budgets on security or

1057
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,560
um because they were very much reading

1058
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,720
the notion of risk very differently and

1059
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,599
also the the potential in impact so by

1060
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,220
putting different stakeholders together

1061
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:44,040
it is a way to help build some sort of

1062
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,440
methodology that can inform and speak a

1063
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,859
language that could combine or unite

1064
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:52,680
um going forward because so far this

1065
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,200
very siled and I think these coming up

1066
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,760
within a methodology that can help break

1067
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,800
down those silos or where at least

1068
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,880
they're speaking some sort of common

1069
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,560
language so that they can unders that

1070
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,200
everybody can can adhere to I think will

1071
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,720
help as we move forward thank you

1072
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,940
yeah

1073
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:15,200
any other questions

1074
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,839
thank you very much for your time for

1075
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:22,279
your insights thank you
