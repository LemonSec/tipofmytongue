1
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,220
so thank you good morning everybody uh

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:07,080
it's uh great to be here

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,940
um as mentioned my name is Neil Thacker

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,179
I'm the ciso from here for netscope and

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,799
I am going to be talking about again the

6
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:16,740
business value uh with sassy um just a

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,539
quick show of hands who is familiar with

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:22,020
the term sassy also correct service edge

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,060
okay great so about half half of the

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,160
room okay so

11
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,199
um it's always tough when you put in a a

12
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,460
presentation and you're up against

13
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,980
another talk that's focused on data

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,200
science and machine learning and of

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,059
course I've used the term here but this

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:38,040
is hopefully beneficial to both

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,460
Defenders from how organizations are

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,620
adapting and changing perhaps their

19
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,559
Enterprises but also from an attacker

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,180
perspective if you're a red teamer

21
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,500
perhaps again understanding how

22
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,000
organizations are

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,100
typically moving away from a traditional

24
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,860
corporate Network and again moving to

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,280
this type of uh again architecture

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,020
and as I said it stands for secure

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,059
access service edge so we're seeing more

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:04,979
and more organizations look to move and

29
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,600
lift and shift many of their security

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,299
controls again to that edge

31
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:11,280
just a quick introduction to me

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
um I spent about 20 years now over 20

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,000
years we stopped counting after 20 years

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,580
I think until you get to 30 years 20

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,280
years in I.T security that's what we

36
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,979
call it in back in the day and then of

37
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,780
course information security in our cyber

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,799
security

39
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,240
I spent a number of years in financial

40
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,700
services running security teams running

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,740
security operations running again red

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,979
team blue team purple team exercises

43
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,600
um I keep my certifications up to date

44
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,720
for the uh for the Auditors but again I

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,880
also um I love what I do and in my spare

46
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,700
time I'm uh I'm co-founder to the

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,340
security advisor Alliance this is a

48
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,079
non-profit aimed at bringing more people

49
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,000
into cyber security

50
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
so giving talks in schools colleges

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,960
universities try to bring more people

52
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,340
into the industry

53
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,100
I also am advisory council member to the

54
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,840
cloud security Alliance

55
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,840
um I've been following CSA and uh all

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,340
the way back to the kind of the Jericho

57
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,500
Forum days so again over 20 years ago

58
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,380
when Jericho spoke about

59
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,480
um again a depramatization

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,000
and how this would occur over the next

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,620
10 years I think it was

62
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,819
um we're still seeing organizations

63
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,580
going through that uh that phase and

64
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,260
then finally I spent seven years with

65
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,480
Anissa uh again volunteering my time

66
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,239
working with Anisa the EU Agency for

67
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:29,879
cyber security specifically on again

68
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:33,180
cloud and Cloud threats again working

69
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,099
with them closely my my last day with

70
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:38,340
Anissa was on the 31st of January 2020.

71
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,800
uh that was the day that uh the UK left

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200
the EU so that wasn't my official last

73
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,540
day and I was I was not necessarily

74
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,239
escorted to the airport but uh again I I

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,340
kind of waved goodbye to uh to the EU on

76
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,140
that day and then forevermore I've had

77
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,060
to join the long queues at airports

78
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,540
right so again that that's my my role my

79
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,940
background uh again my experience

80
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,660
um

81
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,060
but today I wanted to talk about two

82
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,980
things again the business value of sassy

83
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,120
but also talking about where

84
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,280
organizations are today and perhaps

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,660
where they're heading towards in the

86
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,379
future

87
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,599
and of course for anything future

88
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,640
you have to look at again uh for

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,099
instance artificial intelligence to help

90
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:18,480
us understand what what is the future

91
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,180
going to look like uh and again last

92
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,260
week

93
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,540
um when we had when many people had

94
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,159
access to the Dali 2 this week it's just

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,239
not been available there's too many

96
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,760
people using it I asked again Darley too

97
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,980
what would again the next 20 years look

98
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,220
like in terms of a visual representation

99
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,700
and this is what it created for me and I

100
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,780
was pretty impressed I was like yeah

101
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,280
okay this looks this looks great this

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,200
looks like there is a there is a future

103
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,360
I know it's pretty tough times at the

104
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,440
moment but there isn't there looks like

105
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,519
there is a future there is some

106
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,500
modernization there

107
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,540
um and but then also I started looking

108
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,340
at the kind of almost like desolate

109
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,920
waste Wasteland that was summarized at

110
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,959
the bottom and then I noticed the car in

111
00:03:57,959 --> 00:03:59,040
the middle and I thought that kind of

112
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,959
looks like a car from Mad Max

113
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
so perhaps the future isn't as perhaps

114
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,940
amazing as it looks on here perhaps

115
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,180
again we are looking at some challenges

116
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,920
um and of course a lack of people a lack

117
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,019
of people commuting uh was kind of

118
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,299
interesting the second image I actually

119
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:16,858
again preferred and it kind of

120
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,478
highlights perhaps where people would be

121
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,940
kind of what what the work of the future

122
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,320
would look like how people would again

123
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,840
work moving forward and of course you

124
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,040
can probably look at this and say well

125
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,500
that's a looks like a form of augmented

126
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,440
reality uh again somebody kind of wired

127
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,380
connected working really hard

128
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,000
um but again in the next 20 years it

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,540
looks like according to Dali 2

130
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,940
that the keyboard will still be alive

131
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,620
and carpal tunnel perhaps will still be

132
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,320
a thing so again looking at the future

133
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,540
perhaps this is what the next 20 years

134
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,680
looks like

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,440
but if we look at today right now how

136
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,240
organizations are going through again a

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,220
form of change we need to start looking

138
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,660
at again perhaps what happened in the

139
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,419
last 20 years until the present day what

140
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,100
has exactly changed

141
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,419
and as I mentioned I've been in this

142
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,540
industry now 20 years and I remember my

143
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,460
one of my first roles was to ensure that

144
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,460
people could securely access again the

145
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,440
office through a VPN

146
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,479
uh predominantly it was around accessing

147
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,100
email right that was the main use case

148
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,740
for people to connect in but again if I

149
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,660
now Fast Track and look at the current

150
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,000
modern Enterprise with hybrid work and

151
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
digital transformation I can see there's

152
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,919
a whole again huge uplift in terms of

153
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:31,800
devices connecting in Services being

154
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,360
consumed

155
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
um and again it becomes a real challenge

156
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,520
for today's modern Enterprise

157
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,160
the challenges typically seen however is

158
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,479
that there are still some traditional

159
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,000
tools being used like a VPN like a web

160
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
proxy to try to again secure the

161
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,280
organization and really back in the I

162
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,440
mean even going back before 2003 back

163
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,500
into the 90s the VPN was really again in

164
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,539
in terms of its business use it was

165
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,039
really only designed for again an

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,880
exception wasn't necessarily to to

167
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:05,280
continually secure and allow people to

168
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,440
connect into again those offices in most

169
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,759
cases there was only a few applications

170
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,020
there anyway

171
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,880
so but of course as we start looking at

172
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,380
again the hybrid work and transformation

173
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,900
we now see organizations consuming

174
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,160
thousands of different Services

175
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,979
connecting to all these Services

176
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,500
um and of course people don't want to

177
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,240
utilize a VPN to connect back into a

178
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,220
data center to connect back out to

179
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,259
access their cloud services just makes

180
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,580
no sense

181
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,080
so for many organizations they've

182
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,520
already started to change this of course

183
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,979
changing the way that they connect or

184
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,780
allow their employees to connect to

185
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,720
these services

186
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,340
it has created somewhat of a complex

187
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,580
environment and of course whenever you

188
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,100
have complexity it usually is the enemy

189
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,139
of security right we normally have

190
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:51,300
organizations that have very complex

191
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,180
networks a very complex set of security

192
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,759
controls each one has its own policy

193
00:06:56,759 --> 00:06:59,280
each one has a configuration each one of

194
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,360
course will need to be patched and

195
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,660
updated and it becomes again a real big

196
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,600
challenge but of course these types of

197
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,979
again the complex environments are being

198
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:11,400
used again for Again by the attackers to

199
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,139
again launch things like dry bows which

200
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,060
we've had for many many years because

201
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,699
again perhaps they're not being able to

202
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:18,300
um

203
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,099
be identified because of the large

204
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:21,680
volume of events that have been created

205
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,819
perhaps it could be that in some cases

206
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,560
that again the cloud is being used as a

207
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,599
vector and I'll come on through that a

208
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,280
bit later on it could even be that for

209
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,380
instance the supply chain attack again

210
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,759
we've seen a huge increase in supply

211
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,919
chain attacks where even third parties

212
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,660
are targeted to access an organization

213
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,400
and again that could also be through the

214
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,220
use of again cloud services

215
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,780
but if I'm going to start really looking

216
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,340
at perhaps one of the the main

217
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,800
challenges is how organizations are

218
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,199
looking to move away from the VPN

219
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,000
and this isn't a new concept of course

220
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,240
we've had some great papers Google for

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,500
instance talked about their Beyond Court

222
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,139
many years ago for most organizations it

223
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:00,780
feels like last year this year there's

224
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:03,120
been an acceleration in terms of moving

225
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,400
away from that VPN

226
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,139
and of course there's many reasons to do

227
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:09,599
so VPN was great in his day for

228
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,460
connecting people into again networks

229
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,800
it's great of course if you want to

230
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,840
access other services away from a

231
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,340
network and you want um to be anonymized

232
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,620
Etc of course great use cases but for

233
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,000
for most organizations in their

234
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,440
Enterprise they really want to move away

235
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
from this type of approach because of

236
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,660
course it becomes complex to restrict it

237
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,479
become becomes complex to secure that

238
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:36,059
Network when you start opening up ports

239
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:38,159
protocols and allowing people access to

240
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,380
a portion of the network

241
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,719
and of course we've seen challenges with

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,580
organizations right now with performance

243
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,740
because they now have more people trying

244
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,800
to connect to to through a VPN

245
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,899
um perhaps a few years ago the answer

246
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:54,240
was well buy more VPN buy more services

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,880
buy more concentrators but actually what

248
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,980
we're seeing this change is that again

249
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,839
wanting to move away from that to scale

250
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,060
more effectively to reduce the

251
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,180
complexity to in many cases to also

252
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,279
prevent lateral movement okay there's

253
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:10,560
been a big big drive right now in terms

254
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,500
of moving away from vpns because the

255
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,120
possibilities that lie in place in terms

256
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,440
of lateral movement

257
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,060
and actually if you look at the last few

258
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,100
years in terms of specific attacks

259
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,459
there's been a 20x increase in attacks

260
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:26,459
against VPN and services and it pretty

261
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:28,019
much every every month or every week

262
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,459
that goes by I typically see a new

263
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:30,720
vulnerability that's been discovered

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,180
again on a VPN service

265
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:33,959
um

266
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,640
interestingly enough what I've seen is

267
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,620
that very few organizations actually

268
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,420
keep up to date with patching their VPN

269
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,120
services and of course those VPN

270
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,760
Services can be a Gateway into an

271
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,959
organization

272
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,240
as well and of course there's a number

273
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,860
of groups that are specifically

274
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,440
targeting VPN vulnerabilities

275
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,940
um I won't go through the details here

276
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,620
but again we've seen a huge increase in

277
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,380
terms of again these types of attacks

278
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,500
so the answer for for in terms of VPN

279
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,019
was typically looking at things like

280
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:05,459
like a zero trust network access

281
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,899
capability

282
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:08,459
and actually if you look at the again

283
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:10,380
the the prediction

284
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,480
um in the next um again if we look at

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,920
this the next two years

286
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,399
the 70 of new remote access deployments

287
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,260
will be through a zero trust network

288
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,959
access capability and again I'm seeing

289
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:24,240
that I'm seeing that that this year lots

290
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,320
and lots of new projects where

291
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,540
organizations have said again because of

292
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,920
those previous challenges they're moving

293
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:32,459
looking to move to a ztna approach

294
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,920
so there's a big shift for organizations

295
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,260
today

296
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,360
if I look at again other aspects of this

297
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,100
so beyond the VPN but looking at web

298
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,680
Gateway web proxy how people typically

299
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,620
are even looking to move data outside of

300
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,959
the organization I mean this the last

301
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,399
few days there's been some great great

302
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,200
talks on terms of how to do that and how

303
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,720
to again do that without being detected

304
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
and again using perhaps new

305
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,560
vulnerabilities new flaws but if I look

306
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,200
at this again we've even seen a um quite

307
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,360
an interesting evolution of phishing

308
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,120
drive by data axial tax where even again

309
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,399
really simple procedures are in place

310
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,160
really simple tactics and techniques are

311
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,740
in place to do so

312
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,480
I'm going to start off though with one

313
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,120
one of my favorite fishing attacks ever

314
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,800
and this goes back I think it was two

315
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,959
years ago I saw this

316
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,820
um and it really kind of changed changed

317
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,140
my life in terms of speaking about

318
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,279
fishing

319
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,100
it's a fishing 101 exercise

320
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,920
so the fishing attack started off

321
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,160
um it came from allegedly again I can't

322
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,500
prove this is incorrect by the way it

323
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,440
came from a a Nigerian prince

324
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,380
okay we all know this is pretty again a

325
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,180
common tactic a Nigerian prince

326
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,519
unfortunately he was in space

327
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,459
and he was stuck on a space station

328
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,740
and he couldn't get back down to earth

329
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,959
he'd been up there since 2009 this was

330
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,000
in the uh this was in the uh again the

331
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,260
the build up

332
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,660
to the execution and the demand he'd

333
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,860
been there since 2009. and he was um

334
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,360
he'd been very successful he'd been

335
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,120
bored in his spare time he was uh he'd

336
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,880
been mining Bitcoin right since 2009.

337
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,680
don't we all wish we'd been buying

338
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,380
mining Bitcoin in 2009 perhaps not so

339
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,019
much on a space station but he was there

340
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,079
he was requesting that you send a wire

341
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,899
to Elon Musk not PayPal because Elon

342
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:26,339
Musk doesn't like PayPal anymore because

343
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,320
he obviously sold off the organization

344
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,920
but sent a wire to to Elon Musk

345
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,100
um for it was three thousand dollars

346
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,160
and that demand was okay if I if I send

347
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,260
you three thousand dollars or if I

348
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,060
receive three thousand dollars via um

349
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,180
Elon Musk if I get 100 people to do so

350
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:48,120
that would justify me or qualify me to

351
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,700
get a seat on the next

352
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,040
um uh against spacecraft that's coming

353
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,139
to the coming to space bring me back

354
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:56,880
home and then I can share my Bitcoin

355
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,579
wealth with you so the return on

356
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,680
investment I think was over 100 times

357
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,240
okay

358
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,339
so the goal was again

359
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:08,040
the Nigerian prince the astronaut comes

360
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,360
them back down to earth

361
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,100
and shares his wealth but of course what

362
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,740
happened is it wasn't just a a target

363
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,079
attack specifically on again sending

364
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,760
money a wire but it was also on a

365
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,700
credential harvesting campaign

366
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,740
and as I said the goal was again you

367
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,060
would you would generate a hundred times

368
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,399
your investment and your Bitcoin wealth

369
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,380
would dramatically increase

370
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,420
the best line of all after that whole

371
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,399
story by the way this was a very

372
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,959
successful campaign lots of people fell

373
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:35,160
for this

374
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,519
was that it was 100 risk-free

375
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,079
it was a guarantee that you would get

376
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,120
this uh you would get this payout

377
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,459
so again a very simple

378
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:46,320
hard to believe exercise but lots and

379
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,360
lots of people felt for this

380
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,560
um and again it was an interesting

381
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,959
exercise in terms of fishing but if I

382
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:54,180
now Fast Track into again what we're

383
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,620
seeing in terms of the abuse of digital

384
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,060
trust in fishing

385
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,339
we've seen that again even

386
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,459
simple techniques people falling for

387
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,440
so of course

388
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,180
who would Quick Share of hands who would

389
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,860
click on this link

390
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,300
yeah

391
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,220
that I expected a few more hands because

392
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,420
I spent well hang on a minute you've got

393
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,639
free malware click here we can we can

394
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,019
take this we can sample this we can run

395
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:17,639
this in our environments we can perhaps

396
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,380
do some reverse engineering

397
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,779
I think it was about 0.4 of people

398
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,399
clicked on this link perhaps they didn't

399
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,079
know what malware was or perhaps they

400
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:26,459
were looking at trying to get new

401
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,860
malware samples but again lots of people

402
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,100
still clicked on this link

403
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,779
when we look at this type of link and

404
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,279
I've actually redacted this

405
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,380
because this was a again serving up a

406
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,660
again live live malware and a live

407
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,600
malware binary this is a as you can if

408
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,459
you can if you're familiar with OneDrive

409
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,380
this is a link to OneDrive I think

410
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:48,120
there's over 60 of people clicked on

411
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,100
this link so actually a far hot again

412
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,160
higher greater success rate

413
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,420
but again

414
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,160
many many people have been told for

415
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
instance to look out for suspicious

416
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,940
links and perhaps anything that has a

417
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,199
form of trust if you're familiar with

418
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,579
using OneDrive you're more than likely

419
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,380
if somebody sends you a link you're more

420
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,760
than likely to trust that link and click

421
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,740
on that link but as I said

422
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,060
um we're seeing a huge increase in the

423
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,100
use of cloud to deliver to deliver

424
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,240
malware

425
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,579
but it's not just cloud of course to

426
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:17,160
harvest and collect credentials as we've

427
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,959
seen again

428
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,699
targeted specifically attacks whenever

429
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:22,320
you put a Microsoft logo in the top left

430
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,660
people more likely to enter their

431
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,600
details and perhaps provide credentials

432
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,060
into their uh their Microsoft account

433
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,100
and we've even seen some new techniques

434
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,360
where of course people put in their

435
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,699
their details and it collects and

436
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,800
harvest that information but when they

437
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,240
when they do this two or three times and

438
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,740
they and they next click on sign in it

439
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,180
redirects them to their official

440
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:44,160
Microsoft login page where they can

441
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,720
actually log in

442
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,320
um

443
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,180
I don't think that's still ethical of

444
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,279
course to do that but again it's an

445
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:52,199
interesting technique so it perhaps the

446
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:53,519
next time you you go to log into

447
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,199
Microsoft and it doesn't allow you in

448
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,240
perhaps think about that again has has

449
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,760
my has my information been harvested

450
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,839
um so again be aware of that we're

451
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:03,000
seeing this huge increase in the use of

452
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,240
again known well-known cloud services

453
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,260
also to host and collect this

454
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,660
information we even saw again an example

455
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,800
where um this type of page service site

456
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,019
Etc was hosted everything that looked to

457
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:17,820
be Microsoft signed by Microsoft but it

458
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,480
was hosted on AWS platform as well and

459
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,420
that's not a new business

460
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,519
um offering by AWS by the way to host

461
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,440
malicious Pages that's just the again

462
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,279
the preferred threat actors platform

463
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:33,540
and actually if we start looking at

464
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,980
Cloud delivery threats again there has

465
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,259
been this huge increase in the last year

466
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:40,500
so in 2022 uh one drive of the top five

467
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,019
cloud services and applications that

468
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,940
were used to host and deliver malware

469
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,160
binaries uh OneDrive

470
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,540
um

471
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,940
um had over half of that malware

472
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,680
delivery mechanism we then had GitHub

473
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,660
box SharePoint Source Forge

474
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,399
Etc but the the number goes into again

475
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,199
hundreds and thousands of cloud services

476
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,420
being used to host

477
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,040
um again malware and again it's not a

478
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,660
new business opportunity or Revenue

479
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,699
model for these providers it's just that

480
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:08,099
abuse of those digital trust

481
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,579
um platforms

482
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,020
if I start looking at even the basics of

483
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,119
data exfiltration this is a common

484
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:15,839
um

485
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,179
challenge that organizations have today

486
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:20,900
it's what do I do about non-corporate

487
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:23,640
instances of cloud services

488
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,319
so the example is if you're using a

489
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,799
Microsoft 365 or Google workspace

490
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:30,179
platform in your organization of course

491
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:32,700
there's a corporate version of that

492
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,919
um of that instance itself and you would

493
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,360
typically most organizations of course

494
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,059
would put in a an allow to obviously

495
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,220
allow people to utilize that service

496
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,559
some people may put in a reverse proxy

497
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,620
to allow for BYOD devices and personal

498
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,260
devices to access those services and of

499
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,760
course some organizations would then say

500
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,440
okay well that again we want you to

501
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:54,120
access third party

502
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,620
um Services as well to collaborate with

503
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,240
our again our partners

504
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,039
but in most cases organizations are not

505
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,539
realizing that of course this thing just

506
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:02,640
opens up everybody to access any type of

507
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,820
Google Drive instance

508
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,020
available so you're seeing a huge

509
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,179
increase in terms of data exploration

510
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:12,000
that occurs when again multiple personal

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,340
instances of Google Drive are being used

512
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,140
as just one example

513
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,760
so of course you can do two things you

514
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,620
can say well I can I can block but then

515
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,640
I'm gonna

516
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,380
I can block everything apart from my

517
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,419
corporate instance but in those cases

518
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm going to be blocking access to third

519
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,799
parties and what will happen typically

520
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,360
is probably exceptions will be put in

521
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,059
place and managing exceptions is pretty

522
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,080
tough

523
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,260
or of course I take the risk and I allow

524
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,000
and if that's the example then in many

525
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,140
cases again there's going to be a

526
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,940
likelihood of insensitive data movement

527
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,940
as well that occurs and of course even

528
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,400
if data goes to those Services there's a

529
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
likely likelihood of again that third

530
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,660
party not perhaps putting in good good

531
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,700
security hygiene and controls around

532
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,200
those Services as well for that data to

533
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,720
perhaps be shared more publicly as well

534
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,520
we've even seen of course more recent

535
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,740
examples with things like Microsoft

536
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,140
teams premium where you'll have your

537
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,780
again your GPT enabled capability as

538
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,299
well so you could be joining a Microsoft

539
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:12,120
teams meeting anything you say not

540
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,620
necessarily the the team session may not

541
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,419
be recorded but the dialogue the

542
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,000
dialect's been being being spoken has

543
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,100
been stored as part of an automated

544
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,080
meeting notes

545
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,140
um process and of course that data then

546
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,000
may be accessible by again that third

547
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,880
party or even maybe used

548
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,080
potentially against again the

549
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,580
participants who have been on that call

550
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,440
as well so again look out and perhaps

551
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,900
ask those questions around the use of

552
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,299
um again those premium type tools that

553
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,980
have the AI capabilities built in as

554
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,059
well

555
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:44,280
so again these are really simple data

556
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,720
exploitation techniques we've seen

557
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,280
organizations that perhaps don't have

558
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,600
controls for this

559
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,059
we know that there's again great ways of

560
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,080
um masking hiding data for data X fill

561
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,539
but even if in these situations we've

562
00:19:57,539 --> 00:19:59,039
seen organizations just not have

563
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,280
visibility into Data data data actual

564
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,720
occurs between cloud services as well

565
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,140
so to summarize again how does sassy

566
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,600
zero trust actually help many of these

567
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,580
challenges that we have again the

568
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,460
challenging environment the challenging

569
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,160
um capabilities we've had to implement

570
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,840
over many many years to build again this

571
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,760
complex environment but then also again

572
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,320
even some of the basic techniques of

573
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,200
trying to get into into organizations

574
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,380
and either compromise or leak data

575
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,580
so

576
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,100
for those not familiar with sassy sassy

577
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,559
pretty much is a combination of

578
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,820
um you're networking as a service

579
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,820
capabilities so you're typically your

580
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:44,820
proxy your sd-wan type capabilities as

581
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:47,039
well as again those security as a

582
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,799
service components as well and of course

583
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:51,480
they're typically hosted in a again a

584
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,580
cloud environment they're hosted at the

585
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,340
edge and in many cases they've been

586
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,720
designed of course based on

587
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,080
microservices without the need to deploy

588
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,299
any hardware or

589
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,120
um on-prem type requirements so you'll

590
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,860
see things there so on the security side

591
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,240
secure Gateway

592
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,760
the ability to do of course SSL TLS

593
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,160
inspection at scale to do a verification

594
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,200
of API Json calls back into cloud

595
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,360
services you'll see the elements of

596
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,100
casby that can identify again the

597
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,840
difference between a a personal

598
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,880
corporate third-party instance of a

599
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,860
cloud service doing things like Cloud

600
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,720
security posture management and SAS

601
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,340
security posture management

602
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:32,039
the ability to tie in zero trust network

603
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:35,400
access to that same rule set as well

604
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,220
ultimately so the again the the person

605
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,260
that's utilizing the service doesn't

606
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:42,120
have to decide well do I need to enable

607
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,220
the VPN or not it will just steer the

608
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,260
traffic to the destination and then

609
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,280
you've got

610
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,500
capabilities like data protection threat

611
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,940
protection sandboxing all those things

612
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,860
also built in as well

613
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,419
so this is where the value really sits

614
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,280
it's a case of looking at this as in

615
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,620
terms of a consolidating approach so

616
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,080
networking and security as a service but

617
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,460
looking at how you consolidate and

618
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,620
converge many of these requirements

619
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,360
and again this is why this is uh we're

620
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,100
seeing this as a again a key Initiative

621
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,799
for many organizations today it's either

622
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,140
been led by the networking team

623
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,780
or it's being led by the security team

624
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,240
and actually we're seeing this year more

625
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,640
commonly these teams converging even

626
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
converging elements of budgets to look

627
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,220
at looking at deploying again building

628
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,020
out this uh again this sassy

629
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,640
architecture as well

630
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,260
so again it's a it's an interesting

631
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,360
approach to how we've migrated away from

632
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,280
that complex environment

633
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,380
but this is what the I guess the more

634
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,179
simple version of this looks like and I

635
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,220
always again I like to see again all the

636
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,260
types of connectivity options so people

637
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,360
working from anywhere again we're all

638
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,039
working from anywhere today

639
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,840
um the ability to just connect directly

640
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,539
to again Services we are looking to

641
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,000
consume with again those controls in

642
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,260
place

643
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,940
I mentioned before about looking at

644
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,400
again analyzing for again drive-by

645
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,600
attacks looking at how we can actually

646
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,880
analyze payloads and share information

647
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,460
also with our ecosystem Partners it's

648
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,799
quite an interesting

649
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,480
opportunity here you can see because it

650
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,580
also allows for again how to secure

651
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,940
again BYOD third-party devices and how

652
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,980
to also in many cases do this without

653
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:19,679
having to put a client or a having any

654
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,260
footprint on that device itself and the

655
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,940
goal of of sassy is to offer all these

656
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,220
different traffic steering methods uh

657
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
that can be leveraged

658
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,340
but it's also something we've seen an

659
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,020
increase in how do people actually

660
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,500
secure iot OT Services as well again out

661
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,080
into their again the relevant iot

662
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,820
OT cloud service that manages many of

663
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,460
those sensors and devices as well

664
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,140
so you can see here this is a again a

665
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,720
much more simple approach

666
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,520
um and it follows on the same principles

667
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,280
as like zero trust architecture

668
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,640
so you'll have a a primary enforcement

669
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,220
point at the cloud level but you of

670
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,200
course may also be doing elements of

671
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,780
again device posture checking as well to

672
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,580
verify if there is a risk to the

673
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,740
organization

674
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,200
so taking elements of secure access

675
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,820
service age and applying that to zero

676
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,620
trust these are all the different types

677
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,000
of variables that you actually start to

678
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,580
look at again as a somebody that's Run

679
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,679
Security operations teams in the past

680
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,840
and somebody that's followed the kind of

681
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,020
Jericho forum for over 20 years context

682
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,100
is King

683
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,080
whenever you see an event it you have to

684
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,419
understand again what was the the risk

685
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:29,039
to the organization

686
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,080
did the risk come from a device that

687
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,059
perhaps is

688
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:35,820
um poorly configured has perhaps the

689
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,860
known vulnerabilities hasn't been

690
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,659
updated recently

691
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,900
has again even has a device again

692
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,240
perhaps been been lost stolen Etc having

693
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,740
that at least some of that visibility is

694
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,000
absolutely key

695
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,799
then it's looking at the goip the

696
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,140
location specifically of again the

697
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,480
source the destination traffic

698
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,100
um again we saw some great talks it was

699
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,720
a great talk yesterday about IP spoofing

700
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,580
but of course majority of times you can

701
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,020
get a better understanding of somebody's

702
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,900
location based on Gip and of course that

703
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,240
can be used to identify if you're seeing

704
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,520
a multi a multitude of connections into

705
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,620
the same cloud service that isn't going

706
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,500
through again a um again a a specific

707
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,700
source

708
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,620
you then have of course if a somebody

709
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,539
has been compromised perhaps somebody is

710
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,400
perhaps there has been a game remote

711
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,679
access Trojan enabled on that device

712
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,960
itself again is the has the behavior

713
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,760
changed is there some unusual things

714
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,860
occurring on the device so can we say

715
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,299
now that perhaps there is a likelihood

716
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:32,340
that the the employee that the person

717
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,779
that owns that device perhaps may have

718
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,159
been compromised

719
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:36,720
but this can be said for the same for

720
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,260
iot uh and OT devices as well if they're

721
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,900
again Behavior changes it will be and

722
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,580
again a something a variable that you

723
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,980
would need to consider then you even

724
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,480
have elements of the app trust the

725
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,980
instant trust the activity trust the

726
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,559
Data Trust all of these key elements are

727
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,360
are critical in understanding again a

728
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:57,539
potential incident to the organization

729
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,279
um I'd like to refer to this as the like

730
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,320
the graphic equalizer all right if

731
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,240
anybody's had the the graphic equalizer

732
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,940
their home Hi-Fi stack system

733
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,559
um to understand the kind of changes

734
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,779
perhaps again baselines Etc this is a

735
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:11,640
great way to to consider this but of

736
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,020
course you only need one of these to be

737
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:15,179
considered a perhaps a high risk to the

738
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,220
organization for the you then to take

739
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,539
action

740
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,520
there's also elements around looking at

741
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,980
access control and coaching so and if

742
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,260
somebody does go to a again high risk

743
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,640
application

744
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,860
um that is a new instance to to the

745
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,659
organization you may of course by

746
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,400
default have to put in again a block

747
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,779
action or look to educate or again coach

748
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:38,279
um again the employee

749
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:39,900
but also if you can start looking around

750
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,820
building out that context and applying

751
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,860
all these elements to to formalize again

752
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,140
the zero trust capabilities here

753
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,120
so again instead of just using Identity

754
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,960
or using again device it's understanding

755
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,120
all those elements in in again in

756
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,740
parallel in many cases they look for

757
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,760
that outlier which would require a um

758
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,840
uh an action to be taken

759
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:05,400
but it doesn't end there again some of

760
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,020
the common uh challenges we've seen is

761
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,580
not just about implementing or looking

762
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,380
at sassy as a new architecture with

763
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,419
elements of zero trust but looking at

764
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:14,400
how you can also further consolidate

765
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
integrate and orchestrate

766
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,840
um I shared this slide with my uh with

767
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,700
our with our CIO a few weeks ago and I

768
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,620
said that's what that's what the CRM

769
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,900
mandate pretty much has been the last

770
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,820
few years it's how again organizations

771
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:29,940
from a technology and I.T perspective

772
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,120
um look to consolidate many Technologies

773
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,799
as we've built about that complexity it

774
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,299
is around starting with consolidation

775
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:38,820
it's then how we integrate many of these

776
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,279
Technologies also and capabilities and

777
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,960
then look to orchestrate

778
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,659
now again with with most things there's

779
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:47,940
no one solution for everything

780
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,980
so there's usually a best of breed

781
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,539
capability here

782
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:54,000
but the goal is many of these platforms

783
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,740
have to be built on Open Standards they

784
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,179
have to be built on based on sharing

785
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:00,419
information again through apis

786
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,340
so again the example

787
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,260
um I can share

788
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,360
we had a we had an organization that was

789
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,940
that was accessing a SAS service the SAS

790
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,460
service had been compromised even a SAS

791
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,960
provider themselves didn't know a point

792
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,640
in time that this SAS service has been

793
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,440
compromised

794
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,179
um the organization was was going

795
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,400
through they had a full sassy uh

796
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,320
platform they were able to identify that

797
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,520
there was a compromise there was a

798
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,679
redirect it was doing a DGA to create a

799
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,120
delivery

800
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,799
um mechanism there was a payload that

801
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,080
was analyzed again in a sandbox

802
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,179
that sandbox created the OC That Was

803
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,860
Then shared through

804
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,500
again threat intelligence Services down

805
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,120
to the endpoint

806
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,860
So within that time again we're looking

807
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,360
at time to detection of course always

808
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,799
looking at that but also time to

809
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:44,820
mitigation

810
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,279
so in this example again from from the

811
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,919
event of seeing a redirect to the

812
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,020
ability to analyze the the malware

813
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,179
binary to creating ioc to sharing that

814
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:56,520
to the endpoint across the estate again

815
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,200
was a matter of uh kind of minutes

816
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,900
compared to perhaps hours

817
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,159
but of course there's always going to be

818
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,380
an element of requiring a human to to

819
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,020
intervene and perform further analysis

820
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,059
but in this cases again you have some

821
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,380
key platforms you can take that

822
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,640
information from

823
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,740
if again somebody's Behavior has changed

824
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,299
based on systems they're accessing

825
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,520
through the identity service through its

826
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,740
if it's through detection only Sims or

827
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,840
type capabilities again you can take

828
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,520
those actions and feed those back into

829
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,559
that that Sassy point

830
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,720
which is why sassy actually is

831
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,460
critical in terms of this because it is

832
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,220
that inline control out to web cloud

833
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,260
services

834
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,419
so to finish off these are the key

835
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:37,980
benefits with again we've seen

836
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,480
organizations that have moved to this

837
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,860
approach

838
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,240
um I like to talk about this as again

839
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,360
the RAC Triad not the CIA Triad but the

840
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,220
rec Triad we're looking at how

841
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,840
organizations can start to act better

842
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,520
understand and manage risks to their

843
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,899
organization

844
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:53,640
so first off is better understanding

845
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,080
cloud and getting better visibility

846
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,940
which cloud services are being used in

847
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,260
that organization

848
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,760
it's quite interesting very few

849
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,919
organizations have a great picture of

850
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,260
their full Cloud estate

851
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,200
many of the cases of course they have

852
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,279
the understanding of their public Cloud

853
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,360
use but they're perhaps not an

854
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,220
understanding of their SAS use

855
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,559
so again by looking at again this type

856
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:15,840
of approach better visibility better

857
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,520
again decisions that can be made based

858
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,960
on managing that risk

859
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,880
of course restricting data loss I

860
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,559
already mentioned some of the the new

861
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,659
kind of egress points for organizations

862
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:27,000
to have to consider but again with the

863
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,620
goal we're seeing with organizations

864
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,120
they're looking to apply again data

865
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,320
protection on more of those egress

866
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,779
points than they have done before rather

867
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:37,080
than the obvious endpoint Network and

868
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,580
kind of web channels

869
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,440
and then it's also looking at managing

870
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,000
that third party risk understanding

871
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,380
again the third parties that are being

872
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,520
worked with the information that's been

873
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,620
shared with third parties again who is

874
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,600
responsible for what understanding those

875
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,539
aspects the visibility here is key

876
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:52,980
and then overall reducing that attack

877
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,240
surface

878
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,860
going back to one of the first slides I

879
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,020
shared again a tax service has grown

880
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:00,059
because of of course dispersed a

881
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,860
dispersed Works force and again

882
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,080
dispersed um use of cloud services

883
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:08,159
um looking at increased agility so this

884
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,600
is great for an organization that's

885
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,059
considering well how do I again allow

886
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:14,640
people to do more uh or have more access

887
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,500
to services

888
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,059
and not have to go through multiple

889
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,039
inspection points

890
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,840
um if you've ever had to again connect

891
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,880
to a service and had a VPN and had to go

892
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,460
back calling through again a data data

893
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,779
center you know again the challenge

894
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:30,659
right so here again direct access with

895
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:32,340
Cloud peering this is ultimately where

896
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,740
again sassy plays a key part

897
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,539
supporting again new business models so

898
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,279
allowing people to experiment allowing

899
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:40,440
people to set up and spin up again new

900
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,059
Cloud instances for instance would be a

901
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:43,500
great way to again further support this

902
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,419
but putting in those controls that

903
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:47,279
perhaps perform continuous security

904
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,559
assessments to ensure that that service

905
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:51,539
is being securely configured especially

906
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:53,760
if it contains any confidential

907
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,860
sensitive data

908
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,399
um

909
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,320
and that can actually help and like

910
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,899
reduce friction in the organization

911
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,360
um reduce the number of exceptions in

912
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,520
web proxies for instance but also allow

913
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,020
people to further accelerate their Cloud

914
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,159
adoption

915
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,899
and then finally optimate optimizing

916
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:12,720
cost right it's a it's a byproduct of

917
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,860
looking at this as a more modern

918
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,899
approach of course there's going to be

919
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:18,419
project costs to make them a migration

920
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:20,460
but in many cases you're going it's a

921
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:21,720
it's a goal for the organization to

922
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,919
reduce the number of vendors and

923
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,320
services that are being used

924
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,640
um that's from a security perspective

925
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,559
but also of course from a cloud

926
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:29,940
perspective

927
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,640
allows the organization to perhaps also

928
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,380
simplify operations

929
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,059
again if you're looking at zero trust

930
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:37,919
architecture again looking at policy

931
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,260
enforcement points again the fewer

932
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,020
policies you have the fewer challenges

933
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,460
you have in terms of kind of managing

934
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,559
those policies it does help with those

935
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,840
again operational efficiencies as well

936
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,399
and then of course it's a great

937
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:51,779
opportunity to eliminate some of that

938
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,760
technical data that has been procured

939
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,620
over time to really support the

940
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,539
organization as it's gone through a form

941
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:59,880
of digital transformation I think we are

942
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,279
now in definitely uh moving towards a a

943
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,520
known digital era but of course we can't

944
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,500
rely on many of those Technologies and

945
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,539
capabilities that we've had over the

946
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:11,940
last 20 years for that as well

947
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,100
so key when you add all those three

948
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,260
three things together

949
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,059
it's great to build a business case to

950
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:19,559
show that business value

951
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,019
again most uh organizations when

952
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:23,640
presenting to the board you need to have

953
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,039
a business case the focus isn't more

954
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,799
than just again cost reduction or more

955
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,480
than just improving agility ability

956
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,880
productivity for the organization and

957
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,380
also more than just again managing and

958
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,240
reducing risk again a great opportunity

959
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,700
will be to combine all three elements to

960
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,460
showcase the business value there

961
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,899
so again thank you very much for your

962
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:45,720
time that's again looking at uh showing

963
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,760
business value with sassy

964
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,220
I'm available for any questions if

965
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,140
anybody does have a question I'd be more

966
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,480
than happy uh to answer

967
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,260
um

968
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,659
yes we have a question already great

969
00:33:57,659 --> 00:33:59,519
um if we don't have time or if you'd

970
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,320
refer to answer ask your question a bit

971
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,600
later on we have our standover

972
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,340
um outside come over to the netscope

973
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,559
stand more happy to talk to you or you

974
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,119
can reach out to me again feel free to

975
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,760
ping me on Twitter LinkedIn I'll be more

976
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,899
than happy to

977
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,219
talk to you about anything we've

978
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,899
discussed today

979
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:18,300
hi thanks a lot for the presentation was

980
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,300
very clear I have one question and it's

981
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,639
a recurrent topic related to zero trust

982
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:25,739
and Sassy because in zero trust the

983
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:28,560
concept of perimeter disappears yeah so

984
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,060
all these controls that are amazing

985
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,520
should be the same inside your data

986
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,899
center like I don't want I don't care

987
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,639
where my application sits if it's in the

988
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,800
data center or in the cloud but I want

989
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,300
all these controls so how do you

990
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,339
consolidate that how do you

991
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:43,080
take what you are putting in the edge

992
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,000
that is great but have the same inside

993
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,040
how do you do it in terms of traffic too

994
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,440
then all the traffic needs to go out of

995
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,418
my that Center to go inside into my

996
00:34:51,418 --> 00:34:53,040
representative again that's a really

997
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,940
good question it's a really good

998
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,260
question so there are there are still

999
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,460
options

1000
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,460
of course you could do a run run again a

1001
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,900
software-defined networking on your

1002
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,000
on-prem organization so you don't

1003
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
necessarily have to go out to the cloud

1004
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,000
and back in that could be an option

1005
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,500
there seems to be lots and lots of

1006
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,540
options also appearing more use cases

1007
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,920
specifically on xero trust network

1008
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,320
access as well I refer to it more as

1009
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,780
zero trust application access because it

1010
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,220
really does depend what's running on

1011
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:19,920
your on your on-prem in most cases it

1012
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,660
probably will be an application it will

1013
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,920
be an application stack and you would

1014
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,260
typically again you look to deploy that

1015
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,180
through again a again a piece of

1016
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,640
software software defined

1017
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,500
um in many cases a publisher that would

1018
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,820
sit in front of that application that

1019
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,920
allows people to get to connect in if

1020
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,420
they're outside the organization if

1021
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,560
they're connecting in then of course

1022
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,700
that would then have to go through

1023
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,160
typically a again a sassy service but if

1024
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,420
they're inside the organization again

1025
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,880
you can utilize the zero trust aspect

1026
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:51,780
foreign

1027
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,660
you could integrate yeah the the goal I

1028
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,920
think the goal for many organizations

1029
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,079
today is have an opportunity to either

1030
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,020
integrate or in many cases replace so

1031
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,400
there could be an option also to

1032
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,500
integrate or replace it really depends

1033
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,579
on the use case of course

1034
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,020
right

1035
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,520
I know everybody's really hungry and

1036
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,280
ready to go to lunch right

1037
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,140
but again thank you again and uh yeah

1038
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,579
enjoy enjoy the rest of the conference

1039
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:21,560
