1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,039
all right hello looks like the audio

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:10,440
setup is functioning so that's good I'm

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,820
not screaming it at anyone so that's

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,980
always very helpful hello my name is Joe

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:15,839
slowik uh thank you for welcoming me

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,400
here it's always a pleasure to be in

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,580
Switzerland uh as you can tell by uh

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,320
English is quite good my French is quite

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,199
bad so thank you for allowing me to

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,640
speak in a language that I won't

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,580
embarrass myself in but uh currently I

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,800
lead threat detection development or

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,540
threat intelligence development but also

14
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,160
detection engineering and threat hunting

15
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,719
for a company called Huntress in the

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,840
United States I also do Consulting and

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,160
training through a company of my own

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,559
called Perales but today we're here to

19
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,360
talk about something threat intelligence

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,120
related concerning adversary tracking

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,800
and as you can tell from the subtitle

22
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,500
All The Lies We Tell ourselves so

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,820
perhaps we will touch upon something

24
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,500
that might be a little

25
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,300
interesting

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,520
so for an agenda for today what we'll

27
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,739
discuss is first what's an adversary

28
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,719
mean because we throw the word around

29
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,880
quite easily but we don't take much time

30
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,040
in order to sit down and actually think

31
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,780
what that means and once we have that

32
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,880
settled we'll look at the current threat

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,040
environment and how adversaries relate

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,500
to the tools and the capabilities they

35
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,200
leverage as part of intrusion operations

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,939
with that settled we'll then move into

37
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,740
some examples of what it really looks

38
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,119
like when we talk about certain

39
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,340
adversaries and how we track them or

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,200
what we think that they might be and

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,880
conclude with some parting thoughts not

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,680
just on the the role of threat

43
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,020
intelligence but also its applicability

44
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,119
to various other disciplines ranging

45
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,700
from detection development red teaming

46
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,640
and other exercises

47
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,960
so first

48
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,780
defining adversaries what does that mean

49
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,540
well we could look at the black hooded

50
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,180
hacker or whatever in the hooded

51
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,280
sweatshirt and so forth uh that is

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,840
probably a headache inducing picture now

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,040
that I look at it I should have picked

54
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,020
something different uh but you know okay

55
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,119
so we've got the stereotypical hacker

56
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,820
image but we also have you know our

57
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,520
state-sponsored adversaries that my

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,500
government decides to put up a wanted

59
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,179
poster is this this really means

60
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,580
anything uh but we identify these

61
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,319
persons by name they're part of some

62
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,540
threat uh entity and so that's an

63
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,640
adversary of a type or you could have

64
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,459
some gentleman who is in a very well

65
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:22,319
accomplished business person and posting

66
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,360
with his I believe that's a Lamborghini

67
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,300
in front of Saint puzzles Cathedral and

68
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,860
uh you know that's an adversary as well

69
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,599
if you're involved in e-crime but

70
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:32,640
looking at all of these together you

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,200
know really we're talking about just

72
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,660
short of picking and choosing among

73
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,760
various personas that Define what it is

74
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,500
when we think about who's on the other

75
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,120
side of the keyboard or the other side

76
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,640
of the computer so to speak we want to

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,500
take a very formal definition of what an

78
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,300
adversary means we can look to the

79
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,280
National Institutes of standards and

80
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,220
technology and Define an adversary as a

81
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,080
person group organization or government

82
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,060
that conducts or has the intent to

83
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,760
conduct detrimental activities

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,739
detrimental is a really curious word to

85
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:04,080
use here some might choose the word

86
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,700
attack I actually would not because

87
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,920
attack is quite strong but certainly

88
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,560
that idea that an adversary is some

89
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,659
entity in the world that means to do us

90
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,180
harm and since this is a cyber

91
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,519
conference through some computer or ICT

92
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,040
related means is probably something that

93
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,739
we can settle on however when we start

94
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,420
looking at adversaries and how they

95
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,340
operate things get a little interesting

96
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,620
because the common conception around how

97
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,780
adversaries function is that they are

98
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:33,239
unified single entities responsible for

99
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:36,000
operations we have a Lazarus group we

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,760
have a Conti we have a equation group or

101
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,420
an apt-28 and this represents a whole

102
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,879
entity that is approaching us with a set

103
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,519
of tools and capabilities intentions and

104
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,379
then does US harm in some way by

105
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:51,840
stealing Secrets or wiping our machines

106
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,959
or executing ransomware however the

107
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
operational reality especially I'm not

108
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,860
going to ask for a show of hands but for

109
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,239
anyone who's worked in offensive

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,280
operations in the Cyber realm whether

111
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,560
criminal or otherwise keep that to

112
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,580
yourselves

113
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,040
is that modern cyber operations are

114
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,780
rather complex even if you've been a pen

115
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,939
tester doing everything yourself is a

116
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,159
pain in the ass quite frankly you're

117
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,780
most likely relying on a team of

118
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,639
individuals and not building all of your

119
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,978
own tools but rather relying on

120
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:22,139
individuals with specialized skill sets

121
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,580
and interoperating with one another

122
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,979
doing what it is that you do best and

123
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,780
then either providing or selling that

124
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,720
access to others the expectation that a

125
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,820
single entity can do everything is part

126
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,919
of the entire kill chain or if you're

127
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:36,840
filling in your miter attack Matrix and

128
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,500
so forth is possible but as we start

129
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,540
getting into ever more complex examples

130
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,880
of cyber operations it begins to become

131
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,220
a bit more unrealistic

132
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,560
so if we look and this is very State

133
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,699
operator Centric at the nature of cyber

134
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,440
operations you know certainly we have

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,600
some overriding Authority that's giving

136
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,360
us orders uh hackers with some

137
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,639
acceptance of course as always are

138
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,979
probably not doing operations of their

139
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:06,900
own accord or desire someone's telling

140
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,699
them what to do or they have some

141
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,340
Mission or goal in mind and from that we

142
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,620
have a group or some entity that's

143
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,479
developing technical capabilities the

144
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:17,400
individuals that write the malware that

145
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,560
develop the infrastructure create the

146
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,240
command and control Frameworks and so

147
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,280
forth and then the operators that are

148
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,800
actually using this in engagement and

149
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,479
even in engagements we can see

150
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,280
distinctions between those teams that

151
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,560
establish initial initial access into

152
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,479
environments and then handing that off

153
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,699
to other entities that engage in the

154
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:37,740
actual Hands-On keyboard lateral

155
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,360
movement and subsequent actions on

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,000
objectives so very much a hierarchy when

157
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,520
we start talking about complex lengthy

158
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,160
detailed cyber operations

159
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,960
but the thing is is that this isn't just

160
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,820
our advanced persistent threats or

161
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,520
nation states I hear that word and it's

162
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,620
like nails on a chalkboard or whatever

163
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,020
but you can ask me why that is later on

164
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,139
but uh it's not just apts but rather the

165
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:03,479
criminal space has also evolved so while

166
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,520
we see this nice hierarchical structure

167
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,800
of what say the NSA looks like or the

168
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,560
gru or the FSB and so forth

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,080
e-crime actors have gotten very

170
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,479
specialized in their applications where

171
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:17,880
we have initial access brokers who are

172
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,720
running infos dealers or Landing initial

173
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,520
access campaigns via phishing and then

174
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,780
handing that off to those who are

175
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,880
willing to pay for such access in

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,280
criminal forums but also the developers

177
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
of tools and the Brokers of access to

178
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,479
those items and selling access to these

179
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,180
as well because not all e-crime actors

180
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,680
are going to be developing their own

181
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,600
items straight from source code but

182
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,699
rather acquiring capabilities that exist

183
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,520
on the underground or black markets and

184
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,860
finally as I'm sure many individuals in

185
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,720
the room are aware we have this entire

186
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,639
ecosystem of ransomware as a service

187
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,620
where it's not that you're dealing with

188
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,800
lockbit or Conti or alpha or some other

189
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,020
group as a unified entity but rather

190
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,000
operating in an affiliate model where

191
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,060
you have a ransomware developer that

192
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,560
controls or maintains the infrastructure

193
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,960
that then sells access to that to other

194
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,520
parties that'll actually use it in

195
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,259
operations and then the developers take

196
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,960
a cut off the top of whatever Ransom

197
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,240
eventually gets paid out so again very

198
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,220
complex operations and arguably in some

199
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,199
ways as complex if not more so than what

200
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,080
we see in state-sponsored intrusions

201
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,419
so as we look at this example of what an

202
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:27,259
adversary is adversary cyber operations

203
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:29,340
increasingly represent the

204
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,080
interconnection of various skills and

205
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,240
Specialties that can do not all

206
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,400
necessarily reside in the same entity or

207
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,500
even within the same organization in

208
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,539
order to complete complex cyber

209
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,819
operations whether that's a ransomware

210
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:44,780
campaign or a government Espionage

211
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,520
operation of some sort

212
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,319
so what does that mean for our current

213
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,120
threat environment so this isn't going

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,919
to be a very dry and boring threat for

215
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,180
me if I'm not going to do that to you

216
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,400
that would be mean but really when we

217
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,900
talk about the threat environment do I

218
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,000
have any Witcher fans in the room

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,400
okay couple hands yay I'm not alone in

220
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,400
being a complete nerd we've seen this

221
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,500
sort of conjunction of the Spheres to

222
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,479
use a term from that or if we want to

223
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:11,580
look at this in a much simpler way and

224
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,300
less nerdy uh a convergence of the

225
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,220
techniques that are leveraged by

226
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,220
adversaries once upon a time you would

227
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,900
have entities that create their own

228
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:24,120
bespoke malware or tools and bring those

229
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,520
on engagements now we see something a

230
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,740
little bit different

231
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,780
mimikatz uh Mr Del P has done the world

232
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,339
of great favor or great disservice

233
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:34,020
depending upon who you are and where you

234
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,839
reside in terms of network operations in

235
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:39,839
creating mimikats uh Mimi cats is a tool

236
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,120
that spans the ecosystem from

237
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,700
penetration testers to the most advanced

238
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,459
state-sponsored adversaries but we also

239
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,200
see this in terms of other tools Cobalt

240
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,300
strike there's been much talk about how

241
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,040
Cobalt strike is being replaced with

242
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,320
other remote access tools and so forth

243
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,779
I'm not seeing it really in my

244
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:00,180
visibility certainly other tools exist

245
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,519
but Cobalt strike Remains by Far and

246
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:04,500
Away the most popular and prevalent that

247
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,660
is out there among the commercial or

248
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,240
cracked and pirated Frameworks that are

249
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,980
out there in the environment right now

250
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,019
but we also have tools like Bloodhound

251
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,120
now quick question is Bloodhound an

252
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,459
offensive or a defensive tool

253
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,920
it's both

254
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,540
um but as a result it does a very

255
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,040
effective job whether using Bloodhound

256
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,779
or something maybe a little bit more

257
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,000
simple like ad find or so forth of

258
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,279
enumerating networks and again we see

259
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,320
this ranging from penetration testing

260
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,760
engagements to state-sponsored

261
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,100
adversaries and ransomware entities that

262
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,779
are surveilling the environments that

263
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,120
they get into but even things like

264
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,860
Windows system Turtles it's like okay if

265
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,600
I want to dump memory from a processor

266
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,060
so forth okay I'll use proc dump

267
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,040
um looking at these sorts of dual use

268
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,660
tools extending even into commercial

269
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,880
Frameworks like remote maintenance and

270
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,680
management software the bane of my

271
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,839
existence not to pick on any desk

272
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,420
specifically you could put TeamViewer

273
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,360
Splashtop or anything else in there but

274
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,519
adversaries again spanning the entire

275
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,279
gamut of motivations and sponsorship are

276
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,660
using these sorts of items

277
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,880
interchangeably because one it makes

278
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,180
their lives easier and two it remains

279
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,300
effective we had a discussion I believe

280
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,459
yesterday or maybe it was earlier today

281
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,740
about how you have the African

282
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,720
perspective that the Lions wake up in

283
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,040
the morning and run and you don't have

284
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,660
to necessarily be faster than the line

285
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,220
just faster than the antelope Who's Next

286
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,860
to You Well similarly for

287
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:31,440
cyber operations from an adversarial

288
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,060
perspective like you don't have to

289
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,519
innovate across every operation that you

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,899
execute you just need to be better than

291
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,459
the organizations that you're targeting

292
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:40,980
and unfortunately as Defenders we do

293
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,420
have a lot more that we should and could

294
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,440
be doing

295
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,940
so in looking at the current threat

296
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,120
environment while historically there was

297
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,180
probably a greater degree of individual

298
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,459
Innovation or customization around tools

299
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:55,560
and tradecraft that can be very

300
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,600
effective to try to avoid detection

301
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,459
because you're coming up with unique

302
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,320
ways of operating in individual

303
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,540
engagements but at the same time it also

304
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,880
creates very specific fingerprints that

305
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:08,339
if I know that this malware or that this

306
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,740
technique involved with this tool is

307
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:13,800
only limited to one group or entity if I

308
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,660
observe that in some environment well

309
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,300
then I know within a certain degree of

310
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,060
certainty that that's the entity that's

311
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,579
responsible however now our current

312
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:25,260
reality is that adversaries are

313
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,180
generally converging of the same general

314
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,120
set of tools and techniques using and

315
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,339
abusing open source software cracked

316
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,160
commercial tools and living off the land

317
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,500
techniques binaries and scripts and so

318
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,860
forth in order to prosecute operations

319
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,940
theoretically this could make detection

320
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,279
easier we had a discussion on detection

321
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,440
engineering just prior to this and as a

322
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,060
detection engineer myself I can say that

323
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:48,959
but

324
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,000
saying it's easy to find these sorts of

325
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,079
things especially when they start

326
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,600
blending over into legitimate tools is

327
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,040
probably a statement that you don't want

328
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,560
to make in a seasoned audience but it

329
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,540
also results in a muddy picture as far

330
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,579
as responsibility is concerned if

331
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,140
everyone's using the same trade craft

332
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:07,680
with some fuzzing around the edges being

333
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,760
able to differentiate between a apt-29

334
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,279
and a pick your ransomware flavor of the

335
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,959
week starts to become a little bit more

336
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,459
difficult until you actually see what

337
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:19,260
that operation resulted in or what its

338
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,399
intentions were

339
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,800
that gets us into the division of labor

340
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,660
that we are observing and hinted at in

341
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,000
the previous section on adversaries

342
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,740
so the current threat environment as

343
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,360
we've already discussed consists of

344
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,980
adverse areas that are not unitary

345
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,260
instead we observe multiple teams

346
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,260
engaged in operations as part of this we

347
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,779
see adversaries then capable of sort of

348
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,940
plug-and-play capabilities that I don't

349
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,980
necessarily need to use the same access

350
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,139
broker every time or

351
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:49,320
by my domains or other compromised

352
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,000
infrastructure or use the same botnet

353
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,560
every time if I'm trying to build a

354
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,480
denial of service network or trying to

355
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,820
set up uh burnable command and control

356
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,339
hop points and so forth I can pick and

357
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:00,660
choose based upon the market that's

358
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,639
involved or spin up additional

359
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,560
capabilities and fund them if I'm part

360
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,839
of a shadowy government organization of

361
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:07,980
some sorts

362
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,839
what that means is that I start getting

363
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,779
lots of Replay and reuse of capabilities

364
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:14,820
and more importantly those capabilities

365
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:17,160
are not necessarily linked unitarily to

366
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,519
a single entity operator or so forth but

367
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:22,500
rather can shift depending upon who is

368
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,300
acquiring those services at any given

369
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,459
point in time we could even observe this

370
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:28,740
in terms of source code and Tool

371
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,660
development that the developer who is

372
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,760
responsible for this piece of software

373
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
or whatever that may be associated with

374
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,899
state-based operations realize that if

375
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,399
they wanted to afford their holidays in

376
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,380
Crimea or so forth that they could feel

377
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,420
a much easier job of doing so if they

378
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,519
broke bad so to speak and began writing

379
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,800
ransomware tools and so forth but we see

380
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,019
the same sorts of fingerprints within

381
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:51,000
that developer moving from one

382
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,459
organization to another and thus not to

383
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,560
say that reverse engineering is not a

384
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,240
viable Enterprise it's a very difficult

385
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,700
one and I suck at it but if we start

386
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,560
looking at fingerprints within tools and

387
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,480
techniques we start tracking developers

388
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,300
and not tracking the actual actors

389
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,040
which gets us into the visibility

390
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,680
conundrum when it comes to not just our

391
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,420
state intelligence agencies and

392
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,100
Defenders but especially the commercial

393
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,100
threat intelligence space because out

394
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,019
there is the truth the truth is out

395
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,959
there more nerdery uh but that truth

396
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:23,940
comes from a variety of places or we get

397
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,380
different perspectives on it depending

398
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,600
upon where our data is coming from so

399
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,220
maybe we have internal or product

400
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,820
Telemetry I am a EDR vendor and I'm

401
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,440
sucking up all that data into the cloud

402
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,560
and analyzing it or I am tapping into

403
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,279
the uh

404
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,120
telecommunication companies within the

405
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,680
country that I operate and I'm gathering

406
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
all the netflow that's kind of scary

407
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,100
actually

408
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,019
um but also there are commercial data

409
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:50,160
sets that are out there that I can

410
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,060
leverage by subscribe to Etc uh incident

411
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,740
response data if I'm involved in such

412
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,620
activities but then all even if you have

413
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,760
all three of these it doesn't

414
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:01,500
necessarily get you everything which is

415
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,480
why so much of what passes for threat

416
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,220
intelligence analysis and conclusions

417
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,139
really comes down to just you know

418
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,880
what's the vibe that I feel right now as

419
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
far as this is concerned that that may

420
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,839
be a little too dismissive but the

421
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,240
general idea here is that

422
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,940
we lack a certain degree of omniscience

423
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,220
or Universal knowing when it comes to

424
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:22,620
how operations take place and instead

425
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,120
resemble these poor fellows who are

426
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,260
trying to figure out what the hell an

427
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,699
elephant is without being able to look

428
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,399
at it we get pieces of the puzzle but

429
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,560
never necess necessarily all of the

430
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,720
pieces we may get many of them and I

431
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,459
think we're getting better there but

432
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:36,839
it's still these gaps in our

433
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,459
understanding of who is involved and

434
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,079
what it is that they're doing

435
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,060
so if we're looking at the flow of cyber

436
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,240
operations some adversary entity out

437
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,399
there has an objective or a purpose make

438
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,480
money follow orders steal Secrets Etc

439
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,860
they then perform some sort of Target

440
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,720
development and reconnaissance to figure

441
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,279
out what it is they're doing who it is

442
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,500
they're going after and then conduct

443
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,300
some operation to get into that

444
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,579
environment to break in to exploit it

445
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,800
and then act on the objectives that they

446
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,899
were given at the very beginning lots of

447
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:09,060
things going on here but if we look at

448
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,220
what we actually have visibility into as

449
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,420
Defenders

450
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,940
we do pretty well when it comes to these

451
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,579
latter stages how adversaries got in

452
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:19,860
what they did on the environment we get

453
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,660
that from incident response data we see

454
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,760
that in the tools and capabilities that

455
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,260
are captured after the incident is

456
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,660
concerned maybe we get some insight into

457
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,579
what happened just prior to that we

458
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:31,500
could see the port scanning that took

459
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,480
place or the fishing if we look hard

460
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,220
enough and so forth although we don't

461
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,079
always get this it really depends upon

462
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,720
our data retention how well we know what

463
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,120
to look for and so forth but then as we

464
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,440
start getting at the beginning of

465
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,540
operations we typically have no freaking

466
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,100
clue here

467
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,279
um we can theorize purpose

468
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,399
an intention but very very rarely if

469
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,399
ever we actually know we can infer based

470
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,199
upon what an adversary did if they

471
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,300
completed a kill chain or finalize an

472
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,699
operation but we still don't know why

473
00:17:02,699 --> 00:17:04,919
necessarily now there are some

474
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:07,199
exceptions to this if you are a

475
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
state-based Intelligence Agency of some

476
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,099
skill you are probably on your

477
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,780
adversaries computers yourself and

478
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,980
figuring out what the hell it is that

479
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,119
they are doing

480
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,699
most of us I'm guessing are not in such

481
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:19,740
a position so that's not available to us

482
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,380
or if you are very flexible in terms of

483
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,720
your ethics you could just violate the

484
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,099
law and hack back and figure this out

485
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:28,079
for yourself I'm not advocating for it

486
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,760
or recommending that because there are

487
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,980
laws and there is a phrase that we like

488
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:33,960
to use in America called around and

489
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,539
find out and um you know you don't want

490
00:17:36,539 --> 00:17:38,100
to get to the finding out stage of this

491
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,299
necessarily

492
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,940
so part of the problem with this is that

493
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,440
as we look at the various data sources

494
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,299
that are available a lot of people end

495
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:47,039
up fishing in the same Pond we might

496
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,600
have some degree of internal visibility

497
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,340
whether it's our own organization or if

498
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,200
we're a vendor of some sort our tool or

499
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,820
whatever it is that we're selling in the

500
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,980
marketplace but otherwise everyone's

501
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,960
just kind of poking at virus total or

502
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,179
enriching things in domain tools or

503
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,039
taking a look at our Bazaar thank you

504
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,080
very much abuse.ch

505
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,059
um wonderful tools through the

506
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,820
organization uh or looking things up in

507
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,220
public data sets and so forth and that

508
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,620
means what that means is that so much of

509
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,539
the unique Insight that someone was

510
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,720
going to take a picture I think okay

511
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,340
what that means is that so much of what

512
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,679
we think about some scary unique Insight

513
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:24,240
from companies whose names I will not

514
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,740
mention because there may be employer

515
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,299
employees or them in the crowd and I

516
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,500
don't actually want to insult anyone

517
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,900
rather just spark some thinking and

518
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,780
introspection is that we think that big

519
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,940
scary company full of ex-agents of

520
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,679
certain intelligence agencies or whatnot

521
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,720
has all the answers and so forth worth

522
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,580
when really everyone is just kind of

523
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,320
dealing with glimpses of the picture

524
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,059
from a first-hand source and then

525
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,500
supplementing that with the same damn

526
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,240
data that everyone else is looking at or

527
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,039
at least everyone that can afford it to

528
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,020
a certain extent so what that means is

529
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,059
that we result have conclusions that

530
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:56,580
fail to capture the entirety of what's

531
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,679
going on in adversary space and

532
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,380
oftentimes converge due to our own

533
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,600
dependencies on common visibility that

534
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,580
give us a skewed perception of what is

535
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,840
going on

536
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,780
all right adversaries and tools we are

537
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,059
all tools okay maybe not you I'm a tool

538
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,679
I'm sorry

539
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,160
um in looking at that CTI describes

540
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,500
events and actions we look at what

541
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,179
happened in the network that we monitor

542
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:23,700
or defend or within our customers that

543
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,320
are asking us for advice and guidance

544
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,200
and then we observe the effects and

545
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,600
methods that took place as part of that

546
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,880
action that someone intruded into a

547
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
network deployed some capabilities and

548
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,500
then executed some action on objectives

549
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,200
that analysis however is very limited if

550
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,320
at all capturing the how and why of that

551
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,600
operation and what and how it to why it

552
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,799
took place

553
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,620
but at the same time it seems that so

554
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,000
many of us within the threat

555
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,740
intelligence space are more than happy

556
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,840
to start making claims on intent purpose

557
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,240
and responsibility now again if I've

558
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,120
observed what the final outcome of a

559
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,980
given operation is like oh you've

560
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,780
ransomed the network in order to then

561
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,059
extort cryptocurrency from a victim that

562
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:09,240
seems pretty obvious right well there

563
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,480
are counter examples whether in Ukraine

564
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,640
and certain countries of Eastern and

565
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,620
Central Europe right now as well as a

566
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,179
ongoing campaign in the Middle East

567
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:20,280
mostly involving or affecting Israel

568
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,799
where we've seen ransomware functions

569
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,299
like ransomware encrypts files like

570
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:26,280
ransomware delivers Ransom notes like

571
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,260
ransomware where it becomes quite

572
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,120
obvious that the entity is responsible

573
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,700
have no intention or really care whether

574
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,380
anyone pays up they're simply using

575
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,480
ransomware as a cover for wiping

576
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,160
operations

577
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,020
um progressing as adversaries and using

578
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,000
a capability that is associated with

579
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,940
criminal operations in order to achieve

580
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:47,700
state-based goals and disruptive effects

581
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
so in this case even if we see that oh

582
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,320
they're stealing information it must be

583
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,240
the Chinese or something like that we

584
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,520
lapse into this lazy thinking given

585
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,380
assumptions and what we think that we

586
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,299
know when really all it is that we can

587
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,820
prove and rely upon is how these actions

588
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,200
took place and what tools and

589
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,120
capabilities were used in order to put

590
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,980
them into effect now again there are

591
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,020
always exceptions as I say in my CTI

592
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,360
class the only fundamental rule of CTI

593
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,780
is it depends but within that scope we

594
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,160
can at least look at what the underlying

595
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,080
trend line of what we're looking at as

596
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,000
analysts is saying that there's a great

597
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,039
amount of uncertainty and what we have

598
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,140
some certainty on does not allow us to

599
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,940
make certain claims that nonetheless

600
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,500
become quite popular if you look at

601
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,080
media and other outlets that then go and

602
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,059
say that you know the Russians are in

603
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:34,919
the power grid or the Chinese have

604
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,380
stolen all the intellectual property or

605
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,900
make up something else I don't know

606
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,820
because the analytical reality is that

607
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,799
as we've seen adversarial methods

608
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,720
Converge on a common set of tactics

609
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,140
techniques and procedures behaviors that

610
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,140
adversary tracking thus has devolved

611
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,880
into tracking these common sets of

612
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,860
behaviors now from a defender's

613
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,980
perspective that's fine if I know that

614
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,840
adversaries are operating in this way

615
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,539
again taking a detection engineering or

616
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,100
a threat hunting or similar perspective

617
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,620
that's great I could inform my security

618
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,780
operations center my incident responders

619
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,640
of what these common techniques look

620
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,400
like in Orient defense around them but

621
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,440
because this overall landscape is

622
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,440
muddied in some fashion we still make

623
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,539
the error of persisting that we have so

624
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,520
or claiming that we have some unique

625
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,620
insight into this field when we've seen

626
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,539
adversaries basically picking and

627
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:30,000
choosing from a common sector menu of

628
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,100
operations and then saying that we have

629
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,419
some unique

630
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,940
idea or understanding of who or what

631
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,559
this adversary is and what it is that

632
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,000
they desire

633
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,799
so what does this look like I've given

634
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,860
like lots of theory theory is cool but I

635
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,539
like examples because it illustrates

636
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:46,919
what we're talking about

637
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,260
so where have we seen this before

638
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,500
yes so Star Wars fan as well sorry

639
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,679
winty oh winty winty has been around for

640
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,659
a while uh when T is a malware family

641
00:22:57,659 --> 00:22:58,740
right

642
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,100
well maybe winty is also a group

643
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,080
so Wendy goes back a bit so this report

644
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,120
from Kaspersky on their secureless

645
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,299
websites from 2013 I believe uh and

646
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,480
winty as an entity was attacking and

647
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,240
breaching the gaming industry and

648
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,240
stealing code and other sorts of things

649
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,760
then we've seen an evolution where winty

650
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,100
or what we refer to as winty then turns

651
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,440
into some sort of quasi-state-sponsored

652
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,900
Espionage campaign that morphs into

653
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,820
something that bandians at least refers

654
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:33,780
to partially as apt-41 and then we see

655
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,640
the US government in all of its wisdom

656
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,580
and so forth then decide to criminally

657
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,919
indict individuals responsible for some

658
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,840
of these actions under the rubric of

659
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,960
apt-41 and using a malware called winty

660
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,760
but as we start pulling the thread on

661
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,500
winty and I highly recommend reading

662
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,659
this article there's a list of resources

663
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:53,460
at the end of this presentation so you

664
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,620
don't need to jot these down immediately

665
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,980
uh Daniel Gordon who is a friend of mine

666
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,020
really has punctured the balloon of

667
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,940
winty or whatever to ask us what the

668
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,679
hell is winty at this point then

669
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:07,679
tracking it it for over 10 years and yet

670
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,500
it encompasses multiple adversary groups

671
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,360
all linked to a tool that's evolved over

672
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,860
time for which we don't really know the

673
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,080
Providence or source of its development

674
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,059
and source code yet we persist in

675
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:19,380
claiming that this is some unified

676
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,400
entity

677
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
so we have malware that's associated

678
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,539
with some campaigns almost 10 years ago

679
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:26,760
and then appears in other campaigns like

680
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,419
oh it must be the same people right well

681
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:31,980
looking at the pattern of intrusions

682
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,039
involved in spreading from uh

683
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,620
potential commercial Espionage or

684
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,200
similar sorts of identity theft items

685
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,940
like in the electronic gaming industry

686
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,880
and then transitioning into

687
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,659
state-sponsored Espionage against

688
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:47,760
targets of strategic significance that

689
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,799
looks really freaking weird

690
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,140
and as a result we've seen as a real

691
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,299
because we were relying on linking all

692
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:56,340
these entities to a tool or a capability

693
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,039
that the tool now becomes conflated with

694
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,559
a group and engendering significant

695
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,960
confusion about just what the hell winty

696
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,360
is if we look at Winky and pull the

697
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,400
thread on this a bit harder we see that

698
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,260
winty is a case where overlapping

699
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,780
visibility the lack of true root cause

700
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,940
analysis for given intrusions because

701
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:17,520
you have CTI analysts or organizations

702
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,140
who are just poking at the malware

703
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,760
involved without actually understanding

704
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,559
the entire incident or maybe they just

705
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,000
pulled it off a virus total and thought

706
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,799
it was submitted from a certain country

707
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:27,779
which if you really know how that works

708
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:29,460
is effectively meaningless in those

709
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,860
cases and then started conflating that

710
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,200
capability on its own with being a

711
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,960
single entity that has its own agenda

712
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,840
and so forth very strange and again

713
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,400
something that we can read up more on

714
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,779
but we don't have that much time and I

715
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:44,520
don't want to put anyone to sleep so

716
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,820
winty tool to group very confusing very

717
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,440
unfortunate but they're not alone

718
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,840
sandworm group this is an entity near

719
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,580
and dear to my heart I do a lot of

720
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:56,340
research around sandworm but having said

721
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,200
that sandworm in itself is kind of weird

722
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,020
we start out again almost 10 years ago

723
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,120
with exploitation of the zero day

724
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,400
vulnerability and ice site Partners

725
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,260
which then became mandians which then

726
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,000
became FireEye which then became mandian

727
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,320
which now is Google

728
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,260
released a report uh covering this group

729
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,760
and linking it to Russian intelligence

730
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,860
and then we see sand worm again popping

731
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,200
up in not one but two electric utility

732
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,659
events uh disruptive events in Ukraine

733
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:23,159
something that I've worked an awful lot

734
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:25,200
on in a past life when I worked for the

735
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,880
industrial control system organization

736
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,760
dragos and we've seen again the wanted

737
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,500
posters because these are effective in

738
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,380
deterring cyber operations right uh you

739
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,640
know naming and shaming who the

740
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,320
individuals are that are responsible for

741
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,059
this activity and we even wrote a damn

742
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:40,679
book about these people that's not to

743
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:41,760
say it's a bad book it's a really good

744
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,100
book Andy Greenberg is a nice guy

745
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,960
um it's worth checking out I guess

746
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,220
although I don't agree with everything

747
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,799
in there uh but the result of this is

748
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,220
that we have a decades worth of activity

749
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,140
across multiple disciplines looks kind

750
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,480
of weird because we see this combination

751
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,760
of disruptive operations the power of

752
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,340
events in Ukraine the napatia event the

753
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,679
Olympic Destroyer incident in uh just

754
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,559
prior to the Olympic Games a few years

755
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:10,020
ago we have this assertion from

756
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,400
government as well as private sector

757
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,500
entities that sand worm is linked to

758
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,940
Russia's Military Intelligence

759
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,059
organization the Gru and then they kind

760
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:19,440
of like to Target Ukraine a lot like

761
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,700
okay like put these three things

762
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,500
together you have a sand worm that's

763
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,240
like saying like oh Behold a featherless

764
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,520
biped I have a man

765
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,100
someone had to get that no damn it

766
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,480
anyway

767
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,919
um the idea being is that we come up

768
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,080
with a description of an entity but one

769
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,640
that is not necessarily unique because

770
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,679
we've seen multiple entities that have

771
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,299
engaged in disruptive operations that

772
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,100
all of which have been attributed other

773
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,900
entities that are linked to the gru such

774
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:45,600
as apt-28 and targeting Ukraine has

775
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,539
certainly become quite the mess right

776
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,360
now unfortunately for the ukrainians

777
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,520
um with various entities across Russian

778
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,400
cyber operations partaking in multiple

779
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,159
degrees to mixed Effectiveness in trying

780
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,440
to operate within that uh invaded

781
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,360
country and so as a result we have to

782
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,919
ask ourselves like what the hell is a

783
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:06,120
sand worm then

784
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,340
from an operational complexity point of

785
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,440
view we have to ask ourselves can the

786
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,440
same group of people the same unit the

787
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,779
same cohesive Band of Brothers or

788
00:28:15,779 --> 00:28:17,760
whatever you want to call them who are

789
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,799
sitting out in the Fishbowl outside of

790
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,299
Moscow have they developed not that your

791
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:26,760
Olympic destroyer and Olympic destroyer

792
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,100
and destroyer and in Destroyer 2 along

793
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,480
with a host of other Tools Plus

794
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,120
weaponized mailbox and so forth acquire

795
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,860
the infrastructure to deploy them and

796
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,140
execute these operations maybe it's a

797
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,520
very big unit I don't know I don't know

798
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,020
Russian Force structure that well and

799
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,240
maybe it doesn't probably matter but

800
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,640
what sort of bureaucratic or lines of

801
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,980
operation and control exist within an

802
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,840
organization like Russia's Military

803
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,299
Intelligence organization because we

804
00:28:51,299 --> 00:28:53,220
look at the varying impacts involved

805
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,740
from repurposing a leaked wiper from the

806
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,140
National Security Agency no not petcha

807
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,240
or well repurposing an exploit in order

808
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,779
to enable a wiper not petcha to the

809
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:05,640
industrial control system events that

810
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,520
we've seen and Destroyer the 2015 event

811
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,380
in Destroyer tubes that often you see

812
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,260
malware get a sequel

813
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,480
how many unique skill sets are involved

814
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,340
so maybe all of this falls under the

815
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,559
broader rubric of the sand worm team

816
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,020
from a Russian

817
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,899
Military Intelligence perspective but if

818
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,100
you're telling me that this is the same

819
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,340
group of 15 25 or 50 people that seems

820
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,440
like a stretch given the wide variety of

821
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,960
actions that we've linked to this entity

822
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,840
so we have this assertion for many which

823
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,820
I agree with that sandworm is

824
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,520
functionally linked to a unit called uh

825
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,940
unit 74455 okay that's fine it's been

826
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:46,919
claimed by enough entities or whatever

827
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,120
and I've seen enough evidence myself

828
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,980
that I'm willing to say that operations

829
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,020
linked to San worm are associated with

830
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,100
this unit

831
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,140
but the complexity and variety of

832
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,880
capabilities that we've observed since

833
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,480
2013 imply that there's more whether

834
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,919
that's repurposing the black energy

835
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,539
framework in order to serve as an

836
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:05,520
initial access and information gathering

837
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,220
mechanism for the 2015 Ukrainian power

838
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:11,159
event onward to the deployment of

839
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,440
multiple wipers of varying degrees of

840
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,419
complexity within the current conflict

841
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:18,000
or the most recent phase of the conflict

842
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,500
in Ukraine

843
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,200
so sandworm in my professional opinion

844
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,940
is someone who studied this group

845
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,279
is not a unitary object as much as it is

846
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:27,779
an opportunistic collection of

847
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,779
capabilities under Russian State control

848
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:33,779
that the gru directs for some for very

849
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,899
malign reasons uh to execute multiple

850
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:38,340
objectives and there are certainly

851
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,020
overlaps in the various tools and

852
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,059
infrastructure used by this entity but

853
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,559
there's a lot more going on here than

854
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,059
just saying like hey it's this group of

855
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:47,220
guys in this office right here

856
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,039
all right apt-29 to stick with the

857
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:52,740
Russian theme uh yeah I need to get that

858
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,960
on a t-shirt by the way

859
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,140
um so yeah Cozy Bear apt-29 maybe

860
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,559
nobelium what does that mean well apt-29

861
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:03,299
goes back uh one of the entities that

862
00:31:03,299 --> 00:31:06,659
were in was involved in a variety of uh

863
00:31:06,659 --> 00:31:08,940
strategic campaigns but perhaps most

864
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,500
memorably in targeting entities

865
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:13,740
associated with the 2016 elections in

866
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,240
the U.S which brought us the Wonders

867
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
that were the Donald Trump

868
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,059
Administration

869
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:20,100
um I live there man so you know just

870
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,760
don't don't get me started uh from that

871
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,919
we've seen a variety of other campaigns

872
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,799
from apt-29 over time culminating a

873
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,840
couple of years ago in that big nasty

874
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,580
solar winds event anyone have to work

875
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,260
solarwinds as an incident responder in

876
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,039
here

877
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,500
ah okay you guys oh yep we got a hand

878
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,080
all right my heart goes out to you

879
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,240
um that was a pain it was a really epic

880
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,820
hack it was very well done uh but we see

881
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,279
at first Mandy is calling this uh

882
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,740
unknown Group whatever the hell they

883
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,020
call that two four five two and then

884
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,980
they merge this into apt-29 okay

885
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,460
mandian's group they could do whatever

886
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,140
the hell they want I guess but what does

887
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,000
that mean it means that we had a group

888
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,159
that conducted this epic supply chain

889
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,820
hack of solarwinds and Microsoft and

890
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,140
then

891
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,299
then that if this evolved the same

892
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:11,700
entity from a group that basically

893
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,039
engaged in fishing and using tools like

894
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,140
Cobalt strike Beacon and so forth for

895
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:18,120
politically motivated actions previously

896
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,059
that seems a little different so looking

897
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,140
at apt-29 what even is apt-29 anymore

898
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,880
historically we see fairly selective

899
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,919
Target specific fishing activity I mean

900
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,480
these guys were epic back in the day in

901
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,159
terms of the select how selective they

902
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,899
were how good they were at picking

903
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,580
targets to send messages to and what not

904
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,580
having worked several campaigns and used

905
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,679
a variety of off-the-shelf publicly or

906
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:41,820
commercially available tools and

907
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,380
Frameworks like Cobalt strike Beacon

908
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,240
okay that's one way of defining an

909
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,460
adversary but then when we get to the

910
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,260
present we see something else entirely

911
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,299
while Cobalt strike Beacon was still

912
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:53,340
used as a post-exploitation framework as

913
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,440
part of the solarwinds campaign as we've

914
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
talked about already everyone's using

915
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,580
Cobalt strike beacons so that's not a

916
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,860
very strong signifier or sign of

917
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,140
uniqueness for this group but instead

918
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,120
what we have observed is the use of a

919
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,620
very complex and very specific

920
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,919
capability Sunburst that was able to at

921
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,320
compile time inject malicious code into

922
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,080
the solarwindsorion software so some

923
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,179
continued use of public tools but an

924
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:20,399
apparent change in victim selectivity as

925
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:21,899
well as initial access and intrusion

926
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,700
mechanisms over time

927
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,440
so as a result if you're familiar with

928
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,659
the ship of Theseus what started out as

929
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,840
apt-29 has changed over the decade that

930
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,460
we've known them so to speak that we

931
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,559
really have to ask ourselves does what

932
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,140
we call apt-29 today in 2023 really

933
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,740
Equip equates to what apt-29 was in 2014

934
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,480
2015. now certainly if we're taking a

935
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,700
who-based perspective to attribution and

936
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,500
apt-29 has been linked by several

937
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,720
government entities to Russia's foreign

938
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,880
intelligence service the svr then

939
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,559
perhaps it is the same but if we're

940
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,659
tracking this as a set of behaviors this

941
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,519
ship has been reconstructed while it's

942
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:04,559
been at sea for the last decade or so

943
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,480
and what we observed today is quite

944
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,620
different from what we observed

945
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,960
originally

946
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,300
oh I went backwards okay so let's

947
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,560
conclude this up because I'm sure

948
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,580
everyone wants to get to their coffee

949
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,379
break

950
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:18,839
so where are we right now

951
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:20,760
a little confusing like what the hell is

952
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,500
this guy talking about you know what's

953
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,359
going on here well

954
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:26,520
what I'm aiming for here is a degree of

955
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,440
clarity and purpose as well as in

956
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,020
meaning that certainly attributive

957
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,239
statements to a degree and tracking of

958
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,820
adversaries are possible but the thing

959
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,280
is we need to be really clear on what it

960
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,918
is that we're identifying and what it is

961
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:42,839
that we are tracking as part of

962
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,639
intrusion analysis and cyber threat

963
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:47,159
intelligence that means understanding

964
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,320
what our visibility is and the

965
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,899
limitations of that visibility and what

966
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:53,520
it is that we're viewing and what it is

967
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,139
that we are understanding

968
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,119
so if we want to look at this and come

969
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,460
up with some overarching conclusion we

970
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,140
could look at intrusion analysis and

971
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,820
threat intelligence as disciplines that

972
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,980
need to accept that we don't know

973
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,380
everything that way our tracking just

974
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,240
Shadows on the wall of the cave so to

975
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,040
speak that are thrown by the adversaries

976
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,200
and mostly reflective of the tools and

977
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,520
the capabilities that they are using

978
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,460
rather than the adversary themselves and

979
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,560
thus where insights become less unique

980
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,420
than we want to think but also

981
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,040
understand the very interplay between

982
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,020
the various entities that are involved

983
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:28,260
in initial access subsequent interactive

984
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:31,079
operations action on objectives and even

985
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,500
funding in guiding such operations it's

986
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,119
really complex out there and to think

987
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,320
that we're going to get the complete

988
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
picture based upon whatever capabilities

989
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,859
are available to us is quite the

990
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:42,660
Assumption and I think we need to

991
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,520
question how effective we can be in

992
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,780
making that assumption moving forward

993
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,820
and what value that might bring to those

994
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:51,180
who are looking to us for guidance

995
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,160
so if there's one really

996
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,320
short conclusion to this beyond that

997
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,660
paragraph that I just showed uh it's

998
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,040
really about intellectual honesty

999
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,560
visibility is limited and skewed but

1000
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,300
conclusions are still possible this

1001
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,460
isn't saying that we can't come up with

1002
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,960
results of our own what it is that we're

1003
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,220
saying what it means is that we just

1004
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,660
need to be honest about what sort of

1005
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,579
results that we can arrive at

1006
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:13,680
that means we must remain true to the

1007
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,780
data that is available to us not go

1008
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,220
beyond what it is that we know but

1009
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,420
remain

1010
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,880
grounded so to speak in what it is that

1011
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,160
we're looking at

1012
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,780
understanding our limitations means that

1013
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,240
to use a phrase that maybe it has a

1014
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,220
Swiss translation or whatever French or

1015
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,839
German I don't know but like getting

1016
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:32,700
over your skis so to speak to the point

1017
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,079
where you're going to fall over and

1018
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,119
cause a mess that we need to understand

1019
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:38,700
our limitations and not go beyond them

1020
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,280
if we want to practice threat

1021
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,079
intelligence and I look at threat

1022
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:45,180
intelligence as fundamentally decision

1023
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,400
support for organizations whether that's

1024
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,079
the sock analyst trying to disposition

1025
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:51,119
an alert or the ciso who's trying to

1026
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,800
understand where they need to invest in

1027
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,020
capabilities in the long term threat

1028
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,339
intelligence needs to then understand

1029
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,440
what parts of the landscape do we

1030
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,720
observe capabilities and actions and

1031
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,320
tools and not try to expand beyond that

1032
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,900
to areas where we run much less firm

1033
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,060
ground or on much thinner ice in making

1034
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,680
claims about who is responsible for

1035
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,060
these actions why they might have

1036
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,160
engaged in this activity and for what

1037
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,099
purpose that activity is undertaken for

1038
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,500
whatever reason so if you're looking for

1039
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,599
things like adversary emulation or

1040
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,480
trying to build detections or a

1041
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,060
defensive plan around a single entity we

1042
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,440
need to understand and take a step back

1043
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,180
that do I even know or can I even

1044
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,520
accurately characterize what that entity

1045
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,980
is or what it means and looking at a

1046
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
converged threat environment with

1047
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,579
multiple entities interacting understand

1048
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:40,619
that while on the one hand I've made

1049
00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:42,599
life a little bit easier from a

1050
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,160
defensive standpoint since I've

1051
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,780
coalesceded on a common set of tools

1052
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,980
although again it's not that easy

1053
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:49,619
because detecting law bins and rmm tools

1054
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,420
and so forth is a real pain in the ass

1055
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,640
at least pain trying to disposition

1056
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,619
between legitimate use and malicious use

1057
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,540
anyway entirely separate presentation

1058
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,720
part of which was right before this one

1059
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:02,280
but understanding how it is that we

1060
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,020
inform and guide those that look to us

1061
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,660
for advice and not going beyond that

1062
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,099
which we can support in that which we

1063
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,240
understand

1064
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,740
so with that I think we have time for

1065
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,480
some questions I'm going to actually

1066
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,079
Advance the slide just so that's me yay

1067
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,240
I'm not hard to find

1068
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,700
um JF Slovak at Twitter also infosec

1069
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,760
it's JF Slovak at infosec.exchange catch

1070
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,160
me in the hall or whatever but this is

1071
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,380
also a list of resources I aired I

1072
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,480
should have put this on a paste bin with

1073
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,099
a QR code because that doesn't look

1074
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:34,200
suspicious at all and let you download

1075
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,940
it very easily but certainly take a

1076
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,680
picture of that if you would like this

1077
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,839
is just a partial list there's a lot of

1078
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,200
other resources uh that you can look at

1079
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,820
most of these items here though have

1080
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,740
good links to other items as well with

1081
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,960
that thank you a lot for this

1082
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,280
interesting presentation

1083
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,640
so we will take some a few questions

1084
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,640
okay

1085
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,720
hi thanks for the talk

1086
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,180
um I was a little confused I have to say

1087
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,160
with uh because a couple of things that

1088
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,380
you said seemed to me to be at all just

1089
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,640
one another so I'm going to challenge

1090
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
him that if I could the last couple of

1091
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,300
slides were saying hey we need to stay

1092
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,579
bound grounded with things that we know

1093
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,619
but earlier you talked about an example

1094
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:24,359
of

1095
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,839
um a common tool being ransomware being

1096
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,400
deployed in an environment where

1097
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,720
somebody didn't actually want to collect

1098
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,240
any Ransom and that seems like that

1099
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,160
relied on stuff you wouldn't know if you

1100
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,660
weren't paying attention to you know

1101
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,700
geopolitical events so how do you sort

1102
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,079
of bridge that gap between these are the

1103
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,640
things that I can observe and I can

1104
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,800
State confidently and these are the

1105
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,540
things I believe to be true based on

1106
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,880
things that I'm observing elsewhere yes

1107
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,440
that's an excellent question and for

1108
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,820
example with the red somewhere that's

1109
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:53,280
not quite ransomware examples

1110
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,440
um those would have been hard uh we've

1111
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,380
gotten help from others so for example

1112
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,839
looking at there's so many of them

1113
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:02,880
involved in Ukraine I can't even

1114
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,619
remember the last one that came up that

1115
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:08,119
Microsoft reported on

1116
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,500
there are sources of information Beyond

1117
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,540
just the incident that can enrich our

1118
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,859
understanding in certain incidents

1119
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,079
that's good because it allows us to see

1120
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,820
that in the case of certain things

1121
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,680
posing as ransomware and just

1122
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,480
mysteriously targeting government and

1123
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,400
critical infrastructure institutions in

1124
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,700
Ukraine Poland and Latvia or Lithuania I

1125
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,240
don't remember exactly is maybe a little

1126
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,800
suspicious and not only that but we can

1127
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,119
potentially confirm it because we get

1128
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,460
sources of information Beyond intrusion

1129
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,900
analysis that begin bleeding into

1130
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,599
adversary space where adversaries are

1131
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,540
making or recording their decisions so

1132
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,240
that is a example that sort of proves

1133
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,119
the general point that very rarely do we

1134
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:51,420
have that happen so while it's possible

1135
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,339
and you know again like I said earlier

1136
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,140
the the one Mantra in threat

1137
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,599
intelligence is it depends there are

1138
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:58,980
times when we can get lucky either

1139
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,079
because adversaries screw up they leave

1140
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:03,480
a bunch of crap on a staging server we

1141
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,680
have a friendly intelligence service

1142
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:07,140
that says hey

1143
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,200
or other sorts of things pop up

1144
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,440
um that there are cases where we can go

1145
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,820
beyond

1146
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,320
um what it is that we're normally stuck

1147
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,500
with but most of the time

1148
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:21,720
assessing intense purpose and so forth

1149
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,160
from just what it is that we are

1150
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,140
observed what we can observe on our own

1151
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,720
doesn't allow us to make that leap uh

1152
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,579
with any justification

1153
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:32,420
okay thank you

1154
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:37,760
thank you uh other question

1155
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,780
so okay I wore a red fleece today in

1156
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,040
case anyone wanted to throw rotten

1157
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,900
produce especially Tomatoes at me so I'm

1158
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,660
glad no one did thank you thank you
