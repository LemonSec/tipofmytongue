2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:17,010
okay thank you for thank you for waiting

3
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,110
and I'm happy to see you see you all

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,510
here

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:26,640
yes and I guess I will need to hurry up

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,710
for and not be boring so the the the

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,090
title of my presentation is these are

8
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,430
the droids you're looking for

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,820
to be honest I was really on offense to

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,399
how to call these presentations is it

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,480
 I found in bug report is it Android

12
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,990
it is hard but I hope this works

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,709
my name is erina Cavatina I work for

14
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:51,450
Google and I'm currently part of

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,390
Google's internal detection and response

16
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:58,770
team working with digital forensics and

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:01,829
it's Incident Response but over my over

18
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,829
11 years in Google I've worked with

19
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:08,600
multiple project dealing with anti-abuse

20
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:11,399
security malware in Google so basically

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,559
over the over this time if it's bad and

22
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:16,640
it's it's targeting Google or Google's

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,240
products I probably worked with it

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:24,509
very modest as for my passion for

25
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,719
Android I've been analyzing Android

26
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:32,340
malware for over five years as an

27
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:34,649
Android security analyst my phobia is

28
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,659
reading Android bug reports for fun

29
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:42,689
because I have no life for for all the

30
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,759
people around me I'm that Android person

31
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,469
also somebody somebody called neurons

32
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:53,909
and working at some point but it never

33
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:55,979
took off and and what am I gonna gonna

34
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:58,679
be talking talking about today well all

35
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,779
start about to just hit hitting the

36
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:04,319
common ground trying to understand what

37
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:06,929
is Android anyway we will move into app

38
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:09,410
level security because I'm because we

39
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:12,990
will be mostly talking talking about

40
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:15,120
performance on an on a device I will

41
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,630
probably mention a bit about about a bit

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,670
about root

43
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:23,799
I will introduce you super sophisticated

44
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:26,079
tools that I use in my everyday work and

45
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:28,780
then we will move on straight straight

46
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,500
into the thing the exciting things that

47
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,030
a humble bug report can tell and

48
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,770
probably will find also some some things

49
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,310
that you will never find in bug reports

50
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:42,280
and may and if you have time will maybe

51
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,640
work on some practical examples and if

52
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:47,470
you are like me is person with 30

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,299
30-second attention span you probably

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:52,090
want to have something to have your

55
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:55,450
hands on while you're listening or not

56
00:02:52,090 --> 00:03:00,750
listening so I prepared for you a folder

57
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:04,299
with goodies honestly it's not malware

58
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:06,040
so here's the link I'll also the it this

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,560
link will also be on most of the slides

60
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,480
you can go to the - to the folder where

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,060
I prepared some bug reports for you to

62
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,989
take a look at I will be I will be later

63
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:19,270
showing you things about them and there

64
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,590
are also some handy cheat sheets that

65
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:26,620
you that that you can take take with you

66
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:29,050
and let's yeah I like putting putting

67
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,870
this warning on after this talk you

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,630
might actually become that Android

69
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,020
person person patoot to whom everybody

70
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:39,880
runs for advice because believe me I've

71
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:44,280
been answering I've been answering

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:47,200
questions for my friends family and

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,060
neighbors and neighbors neighbors about

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,179
androids about what's going on on

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,340
Android device and now I'm kind of as a

76
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,930
as I'm as I moved into Google's internal

77
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,370
security team I answer it for all of

78
00:03:55,930 --> 00:04:03,850
Google so so what are those questions

79
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:07,980
that I that I answer on well almost

80
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:11,230
daily basis well not every day actually

81
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,970
yeah one question why is this app trying

82
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,850
to send a text message well it was a

83
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,250
system a system worrying that but you

84
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:20,320
but the user got confused because who

85
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,010
knows what happens on that black box

86
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,010
called Android

87
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:29,030
how did suddenly an app got on the

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,880
device when the user did not install it

89
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:34,789
that was a real case well app was pushed

90
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,560
by system level or cheese or tea service

91
00:04:34,789 --> 00:04:42,740
it wasn't nice or what the hell actually

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,330
happens because sometimes because

93
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,680
sometimes users that really really get

94
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,650
confused as to what actually happened it

95
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,650
happens on happens on device happens on

96
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,620
the screen why is the device suddenly

97
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:02,750
vibrating or losing battery or losing or

98
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:05,560
all other stuffs and basically the

99
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:10,930
crucial question is is my phone heckard

100
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:16,520
and to answer and to answer that of

101
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:20,810
course I'm kind of always happy to take

102
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,159
a look at the phone to just to see what

103
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,969
to see what you see what's happening

104
00:05:22,159 --> 00:05:27,800
there to break it a bit well like like

105
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:29,960
every like everybody I guess in this

106
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,289
room I like breaking stuff but when you

107
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,880
actually helping it want to help users

108
00:05:32,289 --> 00:05:39,889
break in the breaking the device by

109
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:41,630
breaking breaking into it is kind of not

110
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:47,419
nice because you want to want to want to

111
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:49,639
the device to stay useful but but if you

112
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:54,109
want to ghost won't want to go step by

113
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:56,870
step onto on to being able to diagnose

114
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,849
problems on problems on device which

115
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,610
sometimes does not belong to you and

116
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:06,229
sometimes it's not even geographically

117
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:09,650
here crucial knowledge is is to know

118
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,568
what an app can an app do on Android and

119
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,310
what are all those and the underground

120
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:16,819
and the water current occurrence that

121
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,919
that are present in place on Android how

122
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:22,190
we can monitor devise a device in real

123
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,490
time in in real time just to look under

124
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:27,229
the Android under the hood a bit how

125
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,370
much information you can get out of

126
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:32,800
Android device without roots

127
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:37,360
or result without access to device

128
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:39,820
itself actually and yeah as I look at my

129
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,470
slides now I got another question to

130
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:44,169
myself when I was when I was making

131
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:50,260
those slides is it actually an iPhone on

132
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:53,740
the slide but all right let's let's

133
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:56,469
let's let's move on and first take a

134
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:00,940
look at Android at Android system as

135
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:04,600
such I guess who here never never ever

136
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:08,350
came across any Android device ever no

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,960
nobody okay so it's at least at least

138
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:15,430
everybody knows work everybody knows

139
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,469
Android so basically basically Android

140
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,680
is based on Linux scanner kernel which

141
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,690
[Music]

142
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,919
and on we on this on this level it deals

143
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:29,020
with Hardware of a device a hardware

144
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:31,930
level level in Android is actually very

145
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,849
important and very challenging because

146
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:41,770
as Android is currently running on

147
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:45,700
phones tablets cars TVs my treadmill

148
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:48,370
runs Android I'm not kidding you so this

149
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:52,810
is this is immense amount of hardware to

150
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:55,630
adjust the system to so so so the

151
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,210
architecture of the system supports

152
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,190
supposed to be supposed to be able to be

153
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,349
flexible enough and secure enough at the

154
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,289
same time to in order to deal with this

155
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:08,470
this diversity of different of different

156
00:08:05,289 --> 00:08:10,960
hardware hardware so as we move up the

157
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,080
stack through the hardware abstraction

158
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,710
levels through nativeness through native

159
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,080
libraries and and all the way to the to

160
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:23,950
the android rounds and where where apps

161
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:26,530
were apps run and if we look at even

162
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,380
even and even directories of on android

163
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,840
device are similar to single to linux

164
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,229
system it depends on the device

165
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,110
massively but certain but certain

166
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,539
folders are mandatory no Android device

167
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,610
can function without them and it's all

168
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,699
very similar to Linux apart from one

169
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,690
thing which

170
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:51,200
which I will be will be talking a bit

171
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,140
later and and with all that we're the

172
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,270
apps well apps are all sitting in there

173
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:01,220
nice and boxes in Android runtime and

174
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:04,130
crucial crucial part of Android is not

175
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:06,710
only all the apps are running in their

176
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:09,590
own runtime but every app is treated as

177
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:11,870
a separate user of the system with it's

178
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:18,650
all privileges and it's all and it's all

179
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:22,460
access levels and if we talk about about

180
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:26,090
an athame of android tablets it's

181
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:29,270
simplistic model is the app basically

182
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:31,820
consists of four decks code manifests

183
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:34,640
and resources and Android manifests is

184
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:39,110
crucial because this is where all that

185
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,060
app can do is defined and here here are

186
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,550
the key terms which which I will be

187
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,040
operating talking about Android apps

188
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:50,870
which are permissions in turns brought

189
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:54,860
broadcasts and activities from basic

190
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:57,500
basically permissions many people most

191
00:09:54,860 --> 00:10:01,100
people probably know about the concept

192
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:03,050
of permissions is there is the absolu

193
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:07,160
quest to access certain api's and

194
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:11,780
they're not not granted they are not

195
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:16,839
necessarily always granted interns is a

196
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:19,430
message that that a data protocol quest

197
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:22,010
actions from component of an app and

198
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:24,290
activities our main building blocks and

199
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,380
broadcasts is the way apps communicate

200
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,319
basically intense is the is what the app

201
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:33,130
intends two days hence the name

202
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,300
activities is what the app actually does

203
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,760
permissions is what the app is allowed

204
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:42,260
to do and broadcast is how how the app

205
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,970
is communicating about it and if you

206
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:46,280
look at this simple classification of

207
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,770
app of apps that you will find an

208
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:51,230
Android device those will be system apps

209
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,650
which will be in system directory

210
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,260
they are normally pre-installed and part

211
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,900
of in part of the system

212
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:04,280
can have very privileged access to

213
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:08,959
devices key features and they normally

214
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:12,319
cannot be cannot be removed by anything

215
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:15,050
other than other than flash flashing

216
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,530
device with new system or with system

217
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,689
update user apps those among those most

218
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:23,439
common apps that sit into the data

219
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,900
partition and they can be pre-installed

220
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:31,730
or installed on by user itself

221
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:34,310
they are basically very limited and and

222
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:36,110
they access is limited by granted

223
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,930
permissions and I'd like to mention the

224
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,970
route apps because they are those are

225
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,459
apps that rely on presence of root user

226
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,850
but that's the thing about Android that

227
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,200
by default most of majority hopefully

228
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,840
hopefully there should be all

229
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:54,740
out-of-the-box user devices don't do not

230
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:59,690
have prote user and that is done for a

231
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:01,310
reason because with big big power and

232
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,490
root is very powerful on Android with

233
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,380
big power comes big responsibility and

234
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:11,240
mobile devices turn into breaks really

235
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:14,390
nicely but even without even without

236
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:19,790
without root system some system apps are

237
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:22,970
pretty overpowered for example this is

238
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:25,390
our favorite favorite over power system

239
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:28,040
app called Google Play Store which has

240
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,860
which has a service called Google Play

241
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:34,370
protect which is pretty much it's a very

242
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:38,960
old system I'm I'm delighted to be part

243
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:39,800
of this part of this product for six

244
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,610
years

245
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,260
it's the built in an type of perfect

246
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,810
Asian service it used to be actually

247
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,569
called verify apps but it's it was

248
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:53,180
rebranded as play protect a couple of

249
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,890
years ago so basically what it does it's

250
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:00,469
it has the power over apps that no other

251
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:02,870
app even anti-malware app like and

252
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:04,820
mobile antivirus has because it can

253
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:07,610
block installation of apps that are

254
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,520
known to be harmful it periodically

255
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,670
periodically scans and

256
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,730
some harmful apps and for absolute

257
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,959
cannot remove it disables them so that

258
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:21,400
it they just sit there doing nothing and

259
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,070
probably you surprised how it can be

260
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,709
super powerful but not being able to be

261
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:29,460
able to remove well unfortunately

262
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:32,890
sometimes in very rare rare occasions

263
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:34,960
there is something not very good in

264
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:38,260
system directories of some devices of

265
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:40,720
some manufacturers and as I already

266
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,939
explained system apps cannot be cannot

267
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,310
be just removed even even by a Google

268
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:51,640
Play Project which is the system but not

269
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:54,819
a rota and I'm really hopeful that 99%

270
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:57,760
of users will never actually will never

271
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,160
actually even know that play protect is

272
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,750
there because you will only know about

273
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:11,319
it if there is something bad and on on

274
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:13,630
the phone present and 99% of users well

275
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:18,790
normal users not not crazy users like me

276
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:21,400
who just find small or everywhere they

277
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:27,189
will never see any notification from

278
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:30,310
play protect with that in mind a bit

279
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:33,970
lurks about the rule about the root as I

280
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:38,109
said root is very powerful and sometimes

281
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:41,110
people have a have a good a good reason

282
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:43,060
to use root for for example people that

283
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:46,300
that are power users of Android that

284
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,579
want to do to tweak with the system

285
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,380
itself play with the OS with different

286
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:53,740
features even develop and introduce new

287
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,900
features to their to their OS there are

288
00:14:53,740 --> 00:15:00,000
basically there are basically good and

289
00:14:55,900 --> 00:15:02,350
bad ways to root the device good way is

290
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,350
for people that like just like play

291
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:07,990
playing with the OS and for search and

292
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,810
geekery Android being very developer

293
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,760
friendly there is a way to flash flash a

294
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:14,650
customer own unlock a bootloader and

295
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:15,760
flash a custom ROM on the device which

296
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:18,880
has root user

297
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,850
but even then no please know what you do

298
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,130
in and

299
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:24,950
hope it's not your favorite phone don't

300
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:28,610
do it in your main phone and something

301
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:32,060
that is kind of a bad way of a bad bad

302
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:34,700
way of routine is are using routine apps

303
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,099
and exploits because most routine apps

304
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,580
just use routine exploits so they will

305
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:42,410
be by every anti-malware this service

306
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:45,920
including Google Play project they will

307
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:49,939
be treated as malicious and one and also

308
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,589
for for user devices once for most

309
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:54,140
manufacturers once you break the

310
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:57,050
security model by by routing device you

311
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,360
kind of on your own like it's instant

312
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:03,439
void of warranty and if you break the

313
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,280
device it's yours so please don't please

314
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,380
don't do that but luckily for most of

315
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,040
the users there is no need to root the

316
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,200
device and for for research researchers

317
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,630
and responders and for instigators like

318
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,460
me there are plenty of ways to get at

319
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,010
least some data from a device without

320
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:28,970
relying on on overstepping the

321
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:31,390
boundaries of the system and for and

322
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:34,480
getting back to the question of

323
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:37,520
compromised devices or devices with

324
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,610
strange behavior present and users

325
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:43,699
freaking out not not knowing what to do

326
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:45,440
what is happening for for a researcher

327
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,780
for the researcher the first question

328
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,820
would be how to get into it and how to

329
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:54,589
get logs which will be challenged what

330
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:56,420
is actually happening there well here is

331
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:00,170
my super favorite and super

332
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:02,270
sophisticated tool set that allows to do

333
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:07,760
to do most of the stuff for security

334
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:10,280
research it's basic I'm really happy

335
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,589
that Android SDK actually and SDK tools

336
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,770
are not only for development they

337
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,899
provide very very useful tool set that

338
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,520
can be can be used for development but

339
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:22,100
can it be also used for debugging for

340
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:27,530
monitoring for tracking network activity

341
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:29,149
for for for jumping memory vitiate which

342
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,470
is which is useful when when you're

343
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:32,210
trying to understand what the hell is

344
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:36,649
happening in the black box

345
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,809
ah but also bad news first

346
00:17:36,649 --> 00:17:40,760
unfortunately most of the blocks on

347
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,980
Android are not easy to get even if you

348
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:46,190
even if it's your own device even if

349
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:48,440
even if you have full access to it

350
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,270
pulling some file databases and logs

351
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,720
from your own device it's kind of

352
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:56,389
relatively easy but if it's someone

353
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,630
else's you're likely out of luck

354
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:03,470
especially if that someone else is not

355
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:07,120
is not cooperating then probably you're

356
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:12,380
and from from and from a locked-down

357
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:14,270
Android device which is in which is

358
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:17,630
encrypted by default and there is no

359
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:19,309
decryption key you pretty much will be

360
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:25,100
better off just getting logs out of an

361
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:33,860
actual logs log of a wooden variety so

362
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:35,480
yes so so but what you can use which you

363
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,889
can't have access to device what you can

364
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,610
use you can use Android debug bridge

365
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,230
which is part of Android SDK tools which

366
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:45,350
you can pull individual files for

367
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:49,789
investigation open shell and browser the

368
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:53,178
device lock and lock features make the

369
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:56,330
device dance a bit a bit I want to be

370
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,820
going going on a lot about what's about

371
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:01,370
the commands that are used by Android

372
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,879
debug bridge and how to get it in your

373
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:08,000
goodies folder I prepared a full a cheat

374
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:12,289
cheat cheat sheet of useful Android

375
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:14,630
debug bridge commands which which if you

376
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:19,820
want to play a play around with it play

377
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:22,549
around with it please do and here we

378
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,470
come to the main hero of today's my

379
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:28,250
today's talk to my favorite thing thing

380
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:32,929
about a favorite thing to read before

381
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:36,200
bed is Android bug reports and how to

382
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:41,830
read them once again please pay

383
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:45,900
attention to the goodies and actually I

384
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:50,810
wanted to actually play a game a bit

385
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:53,850
as I keep repeating that I have goodies

386
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:55,889
you can go to the goodies folder and

387
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:02,520
download the bug report called bug

388
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:05,190
report insomniac and answer try to try

389
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,250
to go to this bug report it's actually

390
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:10,800
from this device this device is unique

391
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:15,570
it's been my testing device for for many

392
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:17,700
years it's in a lot of malware so the

393
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,129
answer the question just named the place

394
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:25,710
where it was were that bug report was

395
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:28,140
taken just name of the place and email

396
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,510
that even emailed the name of the place

397
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:34,100
to these devices in email address which

398
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,100
you can also get from the bug report and

399
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:42,120
and and probably told the easy if name

400
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:46,950
name of the place will be in message

401
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:50,760
subject and of course I winds will flow

402
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:53,160
as we speak because there is more there

403
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:56,810
is more than one way to do that to try

404
00:20:53,160 --> 00:21:00,240
to just find the location of the device

405
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:04,280
so let's dive into let's dive into the

406
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:06,720
magic world of Android bug reports a

407
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,810
humble bug report is not just a snapshot

408
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:14,040
of a device frozen in time

409
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:17,190
it's can't it can tell a story about

410
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:20,639
about the device and this story can be

411
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:25,740
used it can be used in forensics

412
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:27,540
investigation and in most cases a simple

413
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:31,740
bug report is more than enough to

414
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:34,290
diagnose most problems it it includes it

415
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,870
includes a variety of data a wealth of

416
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:40,040
data from device such as location and

417
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:42,389
global environment settings features

418
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,629
alerts include including including

419
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:50,370
system alerts and errors account sense

420
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:55,320
and uploads apps the apps app data and

421
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:58,060
their security it was it it was it also

422
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,480
includes a lot of service logs reports

423
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:07,780
messages full syslog and a lot of system

424
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:09,640
dumps have to take up how to take a bug

425
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:14,020
report well there are several several

426
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:16,270
ways most simple way is to go to

427
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,590
developer options on the on the device

428
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:20,200
and there will be an option to take a

429
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,300
bug report it is of course it is you can

430
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:27,340
do it if you have access to the device

431
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:30,960
like the UI is not worked if you if the

432
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:35,199
device is connected to connected to a

433
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:38,860
machine via ADB you go go adb bug report

434
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,930
and and enter the name of output file

435
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,520
but actually my favorite way of taking

436
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:44,650
bug report and probably the easiest is

437
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,960
just it depends on device but you

438
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:49,420
basically just simultaneously click

439
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:53,200
press all the three buttons volume up

440
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:57,040
volume down and and power and the dip it

441
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,770
generates a bug report for you in recent

442
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:03,520
device bug report which will be a big

443
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:06,850
packed folder but basically your your

444
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,220
your your main up object of interest is

445
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:14,469
the text file code called bug report

446
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:18,340
whatever takes see so and the bug report

447
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,710
can only answer three questions first

448
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:22,720
thing will be what is happening now a

449
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,400
snapshot of device what is happening

450
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,250
what was happening on it it's exactly

451
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,550
the moment the bug report was taken it

452
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,080
will it will be a memory dump pulled up

453
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,919
dump of memory of all these services

454
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:38,139
their device state in settings active

455
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:43,300
active settings and the the damp of

456
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:45,660
services will be very exhaustive device

457
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,790
location and environment he repeated

458
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:55,690
active broadcast and much much much more

459
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:57,879
so so for the software for example if

460
00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,580
you want to know the the settings of the

461
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,950
device in your bug in your bug report

462
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:05,980
file file search for damp of service

463
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,380
settings and there will be three types

464
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:11,020
of settings such as global settings that

465
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:14,020
which includes battery or in terms

466
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:16,060
two Bluetooth settings security settings

467
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:20,230
such as locks clock screen if the

468
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:23,290
passport is set screen time out if side

469
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:26,290
Loney gene is enabled in Selenas status

470
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:28,930
and many and many more security settings

471
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:32,110
and and system settings which include

472
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:35,410
like volume and hardware settings and

473
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:37,719
much much much more sometimes it will be

474
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,220
it will be important to know those

475
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,940
settings just to understand the overall

476
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:44,950
state of device what is happening now

477
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,700
the where device is there are three

478
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:48,910
things that can point a device location

479
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,480
first

480
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:55,840
first is the geofence which is GPS

481
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,600
location of the device second is Wi-Fi

482
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,629
network which Wi-Fi network connection

483
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:07,240
and radio States which is connect

484
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:09,910
connection to mobile services and

485
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,830
there's this there are some things to

486
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:14,080
think things to start looking for just

487
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:16,030
to get you comfortable dealing with bug

488
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,220
reports and by the way there is a cheat

489
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,879
sheet for for bug reports as well and

490
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:24,010
your goodies folder you can find focused

491
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,580
activities with the app that occupies

492
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:30,430
the screen or you can get snapshot of

493
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,379
memory and see what apps are active

494
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,600
which app is draining the battery in so

495
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:40,450
on and so forth get broadcast history

496
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:43,419
which is which is actually a which is

497
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:45,670
actually very very useful for diagnosed

498
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,490
since the system slow slow down or super

499
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:52,470
aggressive apps and also getting for

500
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,470
about all the packages or on the device

501
00:25:52,740 --> 00:26:01,570
and for and those are snapshots in sides

502
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:04,390
so for what about short term insights

503
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:08,379
the battery port will will will include

504
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:10,870
locket for for certain term normally

505
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:15,340
normal normally a couple of days of what

506
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:18,429
what was happening on device most most

507
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:23,129
interesting part at least at least from

508
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:24,230
apps safety point of view is app manager

509
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:27,830
message

510
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:30,470
in in locket for example as I already

511
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:33,080
explained of a focus stack which is

512
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:35,750
focused which desk is coming from the

513
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,360
front which activity is crashing or not

514
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:41,750
responding and which processes are

515
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,939
starting you can learn more about that

516
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:47,030
manager by just probably googling all

517
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:49,730
those all those commands + 2 + 4 + 4 +

518
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:53,000
find in full full a full list on Android

519
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:59,960
Open Source Project with with with those

520
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:01,940
messages and to demonstrate about an

521
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,309
easy example well I couldn't I couldn't

522
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,910
probably have having a single

523
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:10,690
presentation without ransomware examples

524
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:14,720
let's look at how how we can find out

525
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:17,150
find around somewhere up on device well

526
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,190
it's not really not really not really

527
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:22,760
difficult to find it because if

528
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:27,980
ransomware comes comes even though runs

529
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:30,309
aware on Android is very 2015 if the the

530
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:37,669
screen will be will be totally over or

531
00:27:30,309 --> 00:27:39,230
overtaken so and on all the androids the

532
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:42,360
user will be completely completely

533
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:43,450
confused and not knowing what to do and

534
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,620
[Applause]

535
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,780
actually this is this is a screenshot

536
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,030
from an actual device with ransomware

537
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,040
and you have a full bug report and

538
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:54,070
you'll get this folder so if you if you

539
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:56,860
want to dig around that with that one or

540
00:27:54,070 --> 00:28:00,350
feel free to do so

541
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:03,469
so let's try to just find this the name

542
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:06,020
of the app and we will do it by grouping

543
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,980
am focused activity and in bug in that

544
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:13,190
bug report and here it is a short

545
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,260
timeline of apps that were occupying the

546
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,320
screen and here you see Google and

547
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:21,350
Android Google quick search box which is

548
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,580
a default Google search Google search

549
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:29,689
box system app spiking for domination

550
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:32,629
which is weirdly named up with weirdly

551
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:36,230
named activity and this is this is our

552
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:38,340
this is basically this highlighted with

553
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:41,860
yellow this is our and somewhere

554
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,620
so we found the name of the app we will

555
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:47,560
we will further investigate more of us

556
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:50,580
but let's move into more short term

557
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,860
inside which is historic broadcasts

558
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:55,929
broadcast as I have mentioned they are

559
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,979
the way apps are communicating in the

560
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:03,930
and and a lot of active broadcasts that

561
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:07,600
haven't been sent my must must must must

562
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:10,360
mean that there is some sort of some

563
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,740
sort of overflow of activity that can

564
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:17,229
help that can happen that can be due to

565
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:19,390
some malicious apps activity some badly

566
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:21,970
coded app activity or just just

567
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,160
generally for for default because of the

568
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:29,740
phone being overcrowded and sluggish

569
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:32,020
durable there off and another another

570
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:35,380
interesting short-term inside is service

571
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:38,200
dumps there there are there are probably

572
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:40,570
hundreds of them that will be in in a in

573
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,130
any bug reports you can check how many

574
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,070
different service dams in your bug

575
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:50,260
report just by just by reference dump of

576
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:52,720
service but some some of the most

577
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,640
interesting are of them are surface

578
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,340
flinger which is what is on the on the

579
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,920
screen and actually all the activity on

580
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:02,169
the surface of the screen connectivity

581
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:07,210
which is a history of short history of

582
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:10,300
network connections content which is

583
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,280
which is a great way to to see sinks of

584
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:14,889
different accounts on the device for

585
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,850
example if the device has a Facebook

586
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:20,770
account Google account

587
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,000
Wikipedia accounts and those accounts

588
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,490
are sinking you will you will see

589
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,140
they're sinking logs and will be able to

590
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:28,870
get a summary of all those account

591
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:31,990
through content service service dump of

592
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,639
content accessibility enabled

593
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:36,730
accessibility features and if they're

594
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,800
used and the big service dump of all the

595
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:41,050
activities or all the activities in

596
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:43,540
turns and broadcasts on device so that

597
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:48,580
that can be attributed to their apps

598
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:50,620
that are using them and in another

599
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:51,270
interesting service dump which can

600
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,600
really

601
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:56,760
tell something about device is damp of

602
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,060
service notification and notifications

603
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,680
are those those notifications that you

604
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,840
get in tray of device when you pull it

605
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,760
down there will be a lot of them if for

606
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,429
example there there are a lot of a lot

607
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:12,300
of very chatty absent device if you if

608
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:15,060
you can kind of parse this code yourself

609
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,220
a bit you can see at the bottom of it

610
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,310
there is if there is it you can even

611
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,410
understand that it's the this this

612
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,360
notification is a stopped media player

613
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,880
on Android device that wasn't raised so

614
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,689
it has some apps previous previous track

615
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,250
pause next and thumbs down and for

616
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:33,690
example if you have chat messages

617
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,760
sometimes those chat messages

618
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,420
notifications will be it will be in this

619
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,090
dump of service so so sometimes it gives

620
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:44,640
a lot of insights for example if if your

621
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:48,840
device is easy is really overcrowded

622
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:53,400
with us and now come good for the

623
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:58,740
exciting stuff geofencing which is which

624
00:31:53,400 --> 00:32:04,620
is devices exact GPS like allocation eg

625
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:07,140
geofence is define identity I with with

626
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,750
it with the GPS GPS card coordinates and

627
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:15,030
it's circle diameter sometimes those

628
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:18,870
circles overlap geofencing log is

629
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:21,930
limited to 200 records and sometimes can

630
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:24,479
actually show tragic trajectory with

631
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:26,400
which the device was moving and which

632
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,810
which objects were coming into this

633
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:33,390
geofence for to friend geofence

634
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:37,440
geofences for in the bug report research

635
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:40,920
for a registered geo fences and there

636
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,580
you will you will see circle coordinates

637
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:48,450
Circle IDs and in the short log with

638
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:52,260
with transitions and with with exact GPS

639
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:54,290
coordinates of the device and and on

640
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,450
this law in this log there will be even

641
00:32:54,290 --> 00:33:00,930
not only location changes and creation

642
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:04,770
removal of geo fences but also location

643
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:08,370
relevant information such as Wi-Fi can

644
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:13,830
and disconnections which also can detail

645
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:16,260
tell a lot and now we move from

646
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,149
short-term so far I've been talking

647
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,980
about things that people think that

648
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:21,920
normally think that Bob report is

649
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,560
limited to which is short snapshot of

650
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:29,400
what was happening on device within

651
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:32,730
hours maybe maybe one day or maybe just

652
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:36,900
now but the real long-term is in sites

653
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:39,240
that that have very useful information

654
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,580
that can be very invaluable for

655
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,240
Diagnostics of what happens on device

656
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,490
and I in particular I'd like to talk

657
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,540
about three long to a long term insights

658
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:54,930
which are actions about accounts account

659
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,610
creation and modification Wi-Fi networks

660
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,950
and Android device stores information

661
00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:02,429
about every Wi-Fi network it ever

662
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:05,490
connected to and app and apps installs

663
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:10,380
and apps information and I'm not insured

664
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:12,300
sure that the digging inside for digging

665
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,750
into bug reports the deeper for

666
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:18,000
different use cases a researcher can

667
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,310
always find find more more interest in

668
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,580
long-term information but let's so hard

669
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:25,380
just talk to talk about this dump

670
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:30,199
if you look for dump of service account

671
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:33,240
you will see pretty much pretty much a

672
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:36,299
full history of when when accounts were

673
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:39,959
created and removed and removed on

674
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,300
device and well this this snapshot is

675
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:43,679
from device with only one account but

676
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,870
sometimes sometimes

677
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,200
devices have more than one account and

678
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:51,179
as you see it is historical it's from

679
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:56,389
the started from the recently from the

680
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:59,300
from the recent hard reset of the device

681
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:02,190
app's history is very interesting

682
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,290
because bug reports contain very full

683
00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:08,160
information about every upon device and

684
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:12,509
it's not just name of every app but apps

685
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,490
user ID install time data location how

686
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,650
it was installed installation packaged

687
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:20,669
apps permissions

688
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:23,719
up status and current state because apps

689
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:26,819
can be in different states states and

690
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:28,349
sometimes if if an app is it is in stop

691
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:32,430
state you will see you will see you will

692
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:35,640
see the app that stopped it so to do to

693
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:38,279
do this to get a lazy way to get a full

694
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:42,989
list of apps apps on the device is to

695
00:35:38,279 --> 00:35:46,289
grab package from the bug report or just

696
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:49,469
search for a search for package and the

697
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:52,979
name of the app in in in square brackets

698
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:56,130
and you will get a full info about the

699
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:57,960
app in this format and where interesting

700
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,779
stuff as for example this is for a root

701
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:06,239
check app here is the code pass here's

702
00:36:00,779 --> 00:36:07,440
the here's the code pass for it and and

703
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,539
you see you see there is full

704
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,950
information about site such as version

705
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:16,609
name and target SDKs and you and use

706
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:21,419
their user ID you in in both formats

707
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:23,339
it's which screen it supports you will

708
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,619
see you will see on top there is first

709
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:29,160
install time the time when the app was

710
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,400
installed and installed and and when it

711
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:34,799
was updated and and you see install

712
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,180
package name you commander it mean it

713
00:36:34,799 --> 00:36:40,499
means that the app was installed from

714
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:44,160
Google Play and below you can see all

715
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:47,160
the permissions of this app this this is

716
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,200
this is every area can be got for for

717
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,239
every for every part up a bit more

718
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,279
details that installer package will

719
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:58,789
won't be present if an app was site

720
00:36:53,279 --> 00:37:01,200
loaded or pre-installed or post via ADB

721
00:36:58,789 --> 00:37:02,819
permissions there will be status not

722
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,109
only if the app respected those

723
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:05,369
permissions but if they were granted

724
00:37:04,109 --> 00:37:09,598
because some permissions are never

725
00:37:05,369 --> 00:37:11,460
granted and just if the app is in stop

726
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,930
state stated will it will show as

727
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,999
stopped state is true and let's get back

728
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,529
to our or our our run somewhere and see

729
00:37:17,999 --> 00:37:23,238
it because we got it it got its name

730
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:23,239
lights go and find information about it

731
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:29,070
so

732
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,280
so this is this is the information about

733
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:34,830
this app you can you can see where it

734
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,360
was a word was installed you can see

735
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:39,090
that there is no installer installation

736
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:42,870
package which means it's not coming from

737
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:47,400
play and I admit I just pushed it on via

738
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:50,100
by adb to show it and if you start

739
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,560
browsing the this bug report you will

740
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:58,680
get more information about about about

741
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,600
broadcast and in terms of this app and

742
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,250
you can for example find its activity on

743
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:05,810
locket for example it was trying to

744
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:09,270
overtake the camera at some point and

745
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,970
another long-term inside the last for in

746
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:14,310
my talk is Wi-Fi networks if you search

747
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:16,950
for jump off Wi-Fi config store you will

748
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:19,680
get all the Wi-Fi networks they up the

749
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:22,620
device have a connected to and when it

750
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:25,529
when it first connected to it which is

751
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,120
also kind of valuable information and

752
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,230
sometimes there is some other stuff for

753
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:32,990
example you looking at Shetty's apps and

754
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:35,460
found some found some interesting

755
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,649
insights about the usage of the device

756
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,800
would it's actually used for or

757
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,530
sometimes it can out your music taste or

758
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,090
lack thereof that's that's actually from

759
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,540
my from my from my own devices bug

760
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:48,420
report

761
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,270
I found the media's media session with

762
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:55,860
the name of the track I was listening

763
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:57,840
and that's all I wanted to tell you

764
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:00,930
about the wonderful world of Android bug

765
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:03,540
reports and how it can be useful in your

766
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:09,210
investigation and in helping probably

767
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:11,160
help in people yeah yes and I guess we

768
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,490
are running to the end I think I will

769
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,870
only have time to actually give you give

770
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:25,310
you a actually should it check of the if

771
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:29,130
anybody emailed me alright

dump in the the geofences with foreign

778
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:49,029
GPS location of the device then we go to

779
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:54,549
Google Maps and here is the hotel where

780
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:57,400
I stayed in Syria so thank you very much

781

find this information useful I will be

783
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:04,290
hanging out around here so if you want

784
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:07,480
to talk about it chat about something or

785
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:12,730
want more bug reports that is come

786
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,560
please come over camera and and it was

787
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:22,840
not it was nice presented to you thank

788
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:29,340
you for being a great audience we have

789
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:29,340
five minutes for questions any questions

790
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:56,770
so thank you for the talk I was

791
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,990
wondering when you analyze apps from the

792
00:40:56,770 --> 00:41:02,410
Google Play Store do you find any

793
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:05,350
malicious apps that route the device of

794
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:08,230
the victim and actually steal data did

795
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:11,620
you encounter that yes there were some

796
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:15,160
those apps luckily most of them were not

797
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:18,509
in play and luckily they do not really

798
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:22,410
work on recent devices because I think

799
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:26,310
starting from L

800
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:29,649
it's not really easy to not not much

801
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:31,210
routine exploits that the apps use work

802
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,040
but he has there were a couple of

803
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:39,640
malicious families I think they were

804
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:42,750
also in the media a lot but they but

805
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,750
they are pretty much dead now

806
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:54,340
hi I have a question about Google Play

807
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:58,960
protect 2-step questions first of all do

808
00:41:54,340 --> 00:42:04,510
you analyze any signature of apps or

809
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:08,650
maybe it's about how app behavior or

810
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:13,120
maybe what data did they collect and

811
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:16,000
second question do you analyze only apps

812
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:20,380
that's installed by Google Play Store or

813
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,920
maybe from another sources as well well

814
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:26,410
good questions thank you there is there

815
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,690
is a gender analysis pipeline which

816
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:34,359
analyzes like billions of billions of

817
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:37,270
apps and and does reakless amount of

818
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:40,180
scans most of it currently currently dun

819
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,220
dun dun automatically use a user using

820
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,730
machine learning and stuff but there is

821
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:48,129
there is also a big and growing team of

822
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:52,870
reverse engineers and malware analysts

823
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:55,240
that analyze that analyze apps the duma

824
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:58,480
the do reverse engineering and analysis

825
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:01,569
and and signature making for apps both

826
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,010
in play and outside of play and play

827
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:06,790
project is moving to the stage where

828
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:10,240
it's able to protect users from both

829
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:14,490
that they both use google play or prefer

830
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,490
to sideload apps from third-party stores

831
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,830
I have one question you were mentioning

832
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:25,240
the fact that you can do network

833
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:28,360
activity tracking using ADB are there

834
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,779
any plans to have something like that as

835
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,400
an app on the device built into Android

836
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:37,420
because most malware could be detected

837
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:40,690
due to the network traces yeah yeah I

838
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,550
know that it's kind of a bit tricky and

839
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:44,620
but I know that there are there are

840
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:47,230
quite a few quite a few apps that allow

841
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:49,420
to do to do that let's chat about it

842
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:53,010
offline because I actually have one of

843
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,010
the apps here on this device

844
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:04,310
all right I think we can okay thank you

845
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,310
very much thank you very much

846
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:09,740
actually I want to ask whether the

847
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:13,560
introduction of bundles has made

848
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:17,430
detecting malware by play protect before

849
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:20,520
publishing harder it's an it's an

850
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:22,799
interesting question of course of course

851
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,530
the mobile developers always want to

852
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,070
kind of hide it but this is why this is

853
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,330
why we have reverse engineers and and

854
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:36,360
security engineers and all the people

855
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:39,509
that that that try to that try to try

856
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:42,090
try to mitigate this the this extra

857
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:50,190
difficulty of analyzing apps okay thank

858
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:52,560
you okay times up you have six minutes

859
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,100
