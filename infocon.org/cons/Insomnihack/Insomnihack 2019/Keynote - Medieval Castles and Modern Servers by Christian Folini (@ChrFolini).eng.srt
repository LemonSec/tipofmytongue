00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:22,529
good morning Geneva good morning

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:25,740
everyone appreciated getting up so early

4
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,009
to attend my keynote today after

5
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:33,239
splendid party last slide welcome to my

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:36,150
keynote we've been building walls and

7
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,760
cars tools and strongholds for thousands

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:42,809
of years many of them have never been

9
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:46,320
breached IT security on the other hand

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,879
is a very young discipline and lots of

11
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,649
the defense mechanism that we're

12
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,489
building every day haven't stood the

13
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:57,390
test of time the evolution has only

14
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,570
started and breaches are happening every

15
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,329
day from all sorts of directions what

16
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,869
could be more fruitful to looking at

17
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:10,200
historical many monuments with a proven

18
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:13,830
success record we know they worked for

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,530
several centuries I admit this idea is

20
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,380
not particularly new IT security people

21
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,689
are talking it about castles all the

22
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,770
time yet they're only scratching the

23
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:29,610
surface people using the castle metaphor

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,490
are usually stopping at the key word my

25
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:36,140
presentation starts at the keyword and

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:41,130
takes you on a journey through history

27
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,470
the talk serves two purposes a I want to

28
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:46,920
inspire you so when you return to your

29
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:50,970
day job you have more knowledge more

30
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,700
ideas more insight why certain defence

31
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:57,600
methodologies actually work and you can

32
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:00,329
make good use of them and be I want to

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,770
teach you the vocabulary and the

34
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:07,350
methodology to use the castle metaphor

35
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:11,060
successfully when talking to nan Peggy's

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:13,709
and explain them virtual cybersecurity

37
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:16,680
concepts that they have a hard time

38
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:19,980
understanding management yearns for

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,000
brick and mortar visualizations of what

40
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,160
you're attempting to build and they

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,100
don't really understand all these fluffy

42
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,070
concepts but when he used castles as a

43
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:35,470
metaphor that tends to work very

44
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:37,989
successfully I have a PhD in medieval

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,910
history and I've been running the

46
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,890
company of st. George one of the better

47
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,709
known medieval reenactment companies in

48
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,529
the world for several years you could

49
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,650
say I've been defending medieval castles

50
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:55,900
for 20 years of my life as a hobby that

51
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:58,239
is but I've also been defending a lot of

52
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:02,790
servers I do a lot of technical works I

53
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:06,280
write articles about books I publish I

54
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:08,019
teach web application security and a

55
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,750
safety in a couple of committees where

56
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,350
we talk about cybersecurity on a state

57
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:20,170
level so I have over 10 years of IT

58
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:23,170
security experience a program today I go

59
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:26,079
to present you three problems that

60
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:30,518
exists that a thousand years ago and

61
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,640
they're still plaguing us today I going

62
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,250
to present three solutions to you that

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:38,380
have proven to work but not really

64
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:41,170
solutions that you're hearing the first

65
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:43,239
time you know his solutions but you're

66
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:45,339
not using them enough or you need

67
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:49,090
pushing for them enough in your

68
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,519
organization's and with the history in

69
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:54,100
mind this will be easier for you because

70
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,450
it will be more clear why there really

71
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,950
work and finally three security

72
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,048
practices that you've heard about at

73
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:05,170
mausam already but are going to

74
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:08,440
reiterate them just because they're so

75
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:13,420
important in historical context but also

76
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:16,410
in IT security let's start with the

77
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,409
first problem

78
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:25,120
security is a process we all know that

79
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,800
with a more playful angle security can

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,710
also be seen as a game it's a game

81
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:32,860
between the attackers and the defenders

82
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,900
on the other side it's a very stupid and

83
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:38,660
unfair game actually because I like hawk

84
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,590
or football it's not about scoring more

85
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:46,100
goals the game is over as soon as the

86
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:49,580
attackers score a single goal the media

87
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:51,470
is completely uninterested in all the

88
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:53,690
goals that the defenders are scoring

89
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:57,169
there is completely irrelevant the only

90
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,500
thing that matters is denying the

91
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,840
attackers a single success because when

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,419
they score a goal you're out as a

93
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,400
defender and you've lost your battle you

94
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,740
didn't do your job and I haven't thought

95
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,960
it will be finger pointing at you so

96
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,990
that's the nature of the security game

97
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,820
and of course in the historical reality

98
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,840
it was exactly the same

99
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,900
that's why castles were so important

100
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:26,948
they were expensive to build but people

101
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:31,039
did it because they knew our lives

102
00:05:26,949 --> 00:05:33,860
depend on the walls we built around

103
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,130
ourselves you could say a medieval

104
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:42,500
castle is a security first policy built

105
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:45,260
into stone and let me tell you this the

106
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,990
constant quarrels between the business

107
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:50,570
departments and the security departments

108
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,449
in companies would lead to different

109
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:57,080
outcomes different from the regular

110
00:05:53,449 --> 00:06:00,080
business wins outcome to a security wins

111
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,240
outcome if the life of the CEO would

112
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:10,669
depend on the success of his defense

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:11,000
team in his company we're looking at a

114
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,130
match

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,710
script that is stored in the British

116
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:21,460
Library today we see a castle a city

117
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:25,489
defended by gates towers and walls and

118
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:30,650
attackers in the front this is a strong

119
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:34,610
defense structure yet a single breach in

120
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:38,120
the wall one gap in the defense layout

121
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,700
one undefended pinnacle on top of the

122
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,730
wall are a bit of a sloppy security

123
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:46,310
procedure at the gate and the city could

124
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:48,860
fall the attackers could win the

125
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:52,669
attackers would score the goal they

126
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:57,500
desperately need here they're using a

127
00:06:52,669 --> 00:07:00,740
Troyan horse an attack trick that is

128
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,800
very popular as a metaphor in medieval

129
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,980
times and also today because it's a

130
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,720
smart visualization of a cunning attack

131
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:15,020
plan of all ruse put into play to

132
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:18,650
overthrow the sophisticated defense

133
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,719
architecture that we're seeing the Troy

134
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:26,270
and Horace is an interesting attack idea

135
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,030
because it is camouflage in a way the

136
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,289
defenders aren't even aware that the

137
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,820
attack is going on

138
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:34,880
they're completely left in the dark

139
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:38,210
about the existence or the progress of

140
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,320
the attack until it is successful and

141
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:44,870
then it's too late

142
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:49,880
of course historical problem modern

143
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:54,169
problem it's all the same denial of

144
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:56,300
service attacks the US has fallen out of

145
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:59,990
fashion a bit the last one to three

146
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:02,690
years since the Mirai botnet cut up this

147
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,550
extortion ransomware crypto miners are

148
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,530
all the rage these days were the

149
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,479
criminals this is what the press is

150
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:11,570
writing about this is what we're hearing

151
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:15,680
this is what our grandparents ask us

152
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,140
about but these fashion trends among

153
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,570
criminals are very short-lived and I'm

154
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,330
sure it's only a matter of time until

155
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:24,500
the us extortion is back in the

156
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,969
headlines

157
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:32,809
and back a very hot topic so what is the

158
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:36,229
u.s. doing the u.s. is an attack on the

159
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:40,400
resources of course the attacker wants

160
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:44,650
to heat up the resources he aims she

161
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:48,439
aims for the CPU level if he wants to

162
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:52,040
consume the whole CPU he wants to eat up

163
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:55,910
the storage the memory of the server of

164
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,569
your service or they want to flood your

165
00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,780
bandwidth so you're no longer able to

166
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:05,090
communicate that's a modern denial of

167
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,959
service attack this is faced on the

168
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:12,050
based on the fact that all resources all

169
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:22,490
supplies are finit and the attackers are

170
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:26,930
eating them for you we're looking at the

171
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:29,420
siege of Damascus on the left behind

172
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,780
we're seeing the King of England with

173
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,719
his army and the lower left corner we

174
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:37,640
see the King of France and historically

175
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,730
not quite correct and the lower right

176
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:44,300
corner we see the German emperor with

177
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:47,450
his vast army his Knights attacking the

178
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:50,270
city of the mask because in modern Syria

179
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:53,990
the city of Damascus is defended by six

180
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:56,360
blokes sitting on a wall looking down on

181
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:59,650
the attackers tearfully they're

182
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:03,020
supported by a huge defense architecture

183
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:06,110
they have a moat they have high and

184
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,199
strong walls several towers and we look

185
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,020
up on the tower with free we see three

186
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,000
additional friends armed with trumpets

187
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,730
and I'm sure they're not afraid to use

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,160
them to defend the city

189
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:20,839
this looks every bit ridiculous in the

190
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,390
light of the arm is in front of the city

191
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,960
but this is the historical reality

192
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,150
they're completely at ease and isn't

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,630
this how it should be it should take a

194
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,300
small security team at a company strong

195
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:38,360
defense architecture and thousands of

196
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:40,549
attackers meaning no problem no ha

197
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,679
to the company it shouldn't be the over

198
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:45,139
the other way around with a lots of

199
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:47,059
security workers in companies and to

200
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:49,970
scrape Kitty's downloading malware from

201
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:52,809
the internet and capturing the secure

202
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:56,089
assets of the company on a weekend

203
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,949
because this defense structure actually

204
00:10:56,089 --> 00:11:01,249
works and thus each of the maskers

205
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:04,040
failed horribly the mass numbers of

206
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:07,720
attackers gave up and they returned home

207
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:12,670
the second crusade attackers the maskers

208
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:15,829
failed in front of these walls

209
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,378
what is a historical siege a historical

210
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:21,829
siege is meant to cut the communication

211
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:25,279
lines it's meant to limit access to

212
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:29,388
drinking water for the defenders and to

213
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:33,860
stop and he supplies any food from

214
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:37,100
reaching the city so like a denial of

215
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:40,429
service attack it has exactly the same

216
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,069
pattern and medieval siege and a modern

217
00:11:40,429 --> 00:11:45,139
denial of service is the same attack

218
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:47,959
pattern but they defended very

219
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:50,929
successful key in historical times and

220
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:53,779
we still have a hard time defending

221
00:11:50,929 --> 00:12:01,579
again denial of service attack at a

222
00:11:53,779 --> 00:12:05,480
certain size a level third problem

223
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:07,040
of course it is known to you denial of

224
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,759
service ethics features are carried out

225
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,579
by advanced persistent threats and

226
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,769
advanced persistent threats are of

227
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:18,008
course very dangerous but have been very

228
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:23,480
dangerous in historical times as well

229
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:27,589
what is an apt an apt is in a superior

230
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:30,410
attacker that has the means resources to

231
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:35,869
know how and the patient's to tried

232
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:39,129
again and again and again step by step

233
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:42,949
he progresses through your defenses

234
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:44,329
until he scores a victory an apt tries

235
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:47,109
to fly under the radar

236
00:12:44,329 --> 00:12:50,569
you're not even aware that he's there

237
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:52,140
until he's entered your organization

238
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:59,400
being ready for lateral

239
00:12:52,140 --> 00:13:04,439
movement that is an apt and of course

240
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:10,290
the concept has existing in historical

241
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:13,050
times as well we're looking at a

242
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,020
painting but a famous Indian artist mish

243
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:19,260
kena this is taken from the aquifer nama

244
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:23,880
this is the biography of Akbar the Great

245
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:26,340
and a ruler that United the kingdom from

246
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,740
modern Afghanistan all the way down to

247
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:32,120
India and led it to an incredible

248
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,620
cultural blossom that is hard to grasp

249
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,940
nowadays where this region of the world

250
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:40,350
fallen out of fashion of it

251
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:45,150
so Akbar was a very strong leader and he

252
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:48,360
was also a very strong commander here we

253
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:52,470
see him laying siege on a city on a

254
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,330
castle high on a hill around a cliff we

255
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,120
have his camp on the lower left corner

256
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:59,730
the attack is raging the city is

257
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,780
defended by walls and defenders and we

258
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:07,460
also have a volcano in the game so what

259
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:07,459
is this let's take a closer look here

260
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,300
what we perceive as a volcano is

261
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:15,840
actually an explosion it's an

262
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:19,229
underground explosion this is akbar the

263
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,470
great digging a tunnel underneath the

264
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:24,750
walls of the city Myshkin are darkest

265
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:27,870
put the tunnel in the lower left corner

266
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,510
very close to the castle of course the

267
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:32,010
entrance would be further away

268
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:35,640
historically he pretty close for

269
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:38,130
artistic reasons but Akbar great had the

270
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:41,910
mining know how to dig a tunnel into

271
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:45,240
stone he had two supplies to feed his

272
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:48,329
army while they waited for the miners to

273
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:51,660
finish their mission and then he had two

274
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:54,420
vast amounts of black powders it took to

275
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:57,719
blow up the tunnel the hill the mountain

276
00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:00,360
and the walls all together so people and

277
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,820
horses would fly through the air and he

278
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,370
would blast his way in through the

279
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,110
castle Akbar the Great is advance

280
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,930
persist

281
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:13,730
Fred a very successful one historically

282
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:17,000
and of course that exists today as well

283
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:19,730
it needn't be as spectacular as Akbar

284
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,660
degrade it need to be James Bond style

285
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:27,709
attacks modern a PT's are much more

286
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:30,709
silent but equally is successful I'll

287
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:32,899
give you a quote by Rob choice Rob Joyce

288
00:15:30,709 --> 00:15:35,268
used to be the head of the NSA tailored

289
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,339
access operations this is the

290
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:41,000
nation-state attacker part within the

291
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:43,100
NSA that actually attacks and goes out

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,959
to tech or a nation-state the

293
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,180
nation-state attacker is there is a

294
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,140
reason it's called advanced persistent

295
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,459
threats because will poke and will poke

296
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,250
will wait and wait and will wait right

297
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:58,339
we're looking for that opportunity that

298
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,829
opening and that opportunity to finish

299
00:15:58,339 --> 00:16:04,010
the mission this is why there is so

300
00:16:00,829 --> 00:16:07,010
dangerous back in the day and are still

301
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:14,750
the most dangerous opponent you can face

302
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:18,079
in the security game the apt has the

303
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:21,640
means and the dedication to try it again

304
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:24,319
and again to sneak into your castle

305
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,370
stealing your assets while you were

306
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,440
enjoying yourself

307
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,570
at the Christmas party alright a

308
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,040
security conference like this one don't

309
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:38,180
don't rush up listen me out let's come

310
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:41,060
to the solutions the solutions are not

311
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,189
mapping 101 on historical problems and

312
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:45,739
the solutions aren't really new to you

313
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:51,320
but I'm putting them in a different

314
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:54,260
light in a historical context because a

315
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:58,540
PT's there tend to leave us at a loss

316
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:01,540
somehow so let me take a stand for

317
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:05,510
flexibility and agility and

318
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:08,510
infrastructure in an organization in a

319
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,809
team or in your prosze system that you

320
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,809
need

321
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:23,510
stability and agility is very important

322
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:28,069
let's start here this is a German salad

323
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:32,000
it is a helmet from around 1480 it is

324
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,070
the end point of a long evolution of

325
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,120
helmets and as it happens I have a

326
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:40,610
replica of that helmet with me some

327
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,530
people have been expecting this so this

328
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:48,830
is exactly the helmet that you see up

329
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:51,440
there outside of the visor the helmet is

330
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:53,409
made from a single sheet of metal that's

331
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,150
one piece of metal there is no welding

332
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:59,930
involved here it just been beaten into

333
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:02,990
shape as cold metal actually this is not

334
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:05,810
heated when it's beaten it is strong as

335
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:08,450
that the front because at the front the

336
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:10,790
knife is expecting the enemy to hit with

337
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,550
his lungs it's very strong at the crest

338
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:17,000
you're seeing the crests are two rims

339
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:19,310
actually it's very strong up here beaten

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,430
from the top and then a bit thinner at

341
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:24,230
the back to save weight

342
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:27,410
it's very aesthetically pleasing with

343
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:31,430
the long tail at the end the front is

344
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,670
made in a way that the lands bounces off

345
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:36,680
it should it can hit the head but it

346
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:38,480
shouldn't stick it should bounce off on

347
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:42,470
the left or on the right that's very

348
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:53,600
important you can open the visor of

349
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:57,650
course when I putting it on and a close

350
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,840
to visor for you it looks as I will be

351
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:04,010
blind but that's absolutely not the case

352
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:06,830
I have an opening slit horizontally and

353
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:09,410
I can now see everybody in the room

354
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:13,010
literally everybody is visible for me

355
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:14,960
while for you my head is all covered the

356
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,330
complete suit of armor would have a

357
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,750
metal beard fitting underneath here so

358
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:22,639
you wouldn't see my head at all while I

359
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,000
still have a complete field of vision

360
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:28,670
and namely when fighting on horseback

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,890
I would see all the other knights with

362
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,760
their Lance's and that's all that is

363
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:38,930
important when I'm fighting on horseback

364
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:41,780
so after centuries of development they

365
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,560
come up with this form of helmet it is

366
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:51,740
the high point of the Gotha guard of

367
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:56,300
armor making but then what if your horse

368
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:59,030
dies what if you fall down on the ground

369
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:02,450
when you need to fight man against man

370
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:07,370
on the ground this is when you open your

371
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:12,260
visor this is a different war situation

372
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:16,790
a different battle going on here we see

373
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:19,160
two soldiers very the same helmet like I

374
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:22,250
do now with the visor open on the Left

375
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:25,220
we have Tommy Helmand my light friend

376
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:29,180
from Stockholm and he is open to visor

377
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:32,600
and now look at his or my field of

378
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,780
vision I don't even see the helmet

379
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,399
anymore now I have complete freedom of

380
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:39,860
vision I see the whole room

381
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,820
most of my head is still well protected

382
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,070
but the priority is now on observing my

383
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,649
environment it's the same helmet

384
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:51,649
different functionality and the field of

385
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:55,130
vision is cut perfectly around my eyes

386
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,910
on the right you see Stefan from

387
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:00,920
göteborg and he's now lowering devisor

388
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:05,060
lowering divisor now is a compromise

389
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:07,970
between Wigan and protection and he gets

390
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,760
protection from the front high up this

391
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:14,330
is used against arrows because longbow

392
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:18,140
arrows are always coming in in a volley

393
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:21,169
like this and by lowering devisor a bit

394
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,410
I'm protecting my face against these

395
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:32,230
arrows while the rest of the head is

396
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:32,230
still perfectly protected so this helmet

397
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,280
is a very flexible piece of armor that

398
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:45,090
is very sturdy but also very mature and

399
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:48,620
resilient it has seen a large evolution

400
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:55,649
over sentry until they arrived at this

401
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:59,929
perfect form why did I describe this in

402
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:03,240
such a detail because this form is

403
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:07,860
perfectly adapted for the purpose it's

404
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,800
built for in our modern world this is

405
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:15,810
very difficult to do to come up with an

406
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:20,040
IT architecture a process or only a team

407
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:22,110
structure that combines all this and

408
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,520
arrives at the same level of maturity

409
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,000
and flexibility and resilience to help

410
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:29,580
you

411
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,160
when defending your assets is very

412
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,639
tricky to do and it takes a lot of

413
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:40,260
thinking and probably more evolution

414
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:46,470
until we find these solutions let's look

415
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:49,230
at the second solution again you notice

416
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:53,100
of course let's look at it in historical

417
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,730
perspective we often talk about a hard

418
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:59,790
shell and a soft core in IT security

419
00:22:55,730 --> 00:23:02,670
that's a poor architecture still we're

420
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:05,610
developing cloud environments now cloud

421
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:09,450
environments are like hard shell soft

422
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:13,199
core without the hard shell you know

423
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:15,210
this is wrong but still they today we're

424
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,570
seeing this being built and that's

425
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:20,880
completely the wrong approach to the

426
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:23,340
security problem what you need is a

427
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,920
layered defense staggered layers of

428
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:31,110
defense behind each other clearly

429
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:34,970
defined gateways a transparent way of

430
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:39,689
handing of access rights and a complete

431
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:42,240
classification of all your data let's

432
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:44,250
look at this concept in historical

433
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,340
context and you'll immediately

434
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:48,130
understand why it works why it is so

435
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,070
successful

436
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,590
this is the castle Oh coaster rates in

437
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,439
Karina and Austria if we're looking at

438
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:59,080
it from southeast it's high on a

439
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,840
mountaintop and it has a lot of walls

440
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:04,539
and towers and defends architecture

441
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:08,080
around it when we walk around the castle

442
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:10,390
we sit on one side it's really steep you

443
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,330
don't want to climb up that the mountain

444
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:16,390
in Armour as an attacker from the other

445
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:20,350
side you're already seeing the access

446
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:23,679
road closely defended by several towers

447
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:27,549
and gates tacked behind each other and

448
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,770
then from the south you see the complete

449
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:35,530
image I've counted them

450
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:40,299
that's 14 gates that's 14 security

451
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:51,039
sectors one after the other that is more

452
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:54,580
to this than only gates and walls there

453
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:57,700
is a lot more hidden here because the

454
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,860
attacker he can fight on a gate and get

455
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:02,770
entrance to the gate so he approaches

456
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,918
into the next security sector but there

457
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:09,250
he is completely naked again he will get

458
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,880
no rest because the defender will always

459
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:14,860
have perfect vision down on him and the

460
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,049
attacker doesn't have any cover it's a

461
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:19,449
constant uphill battle for the attacker

462
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:22,299
while the defender is perfectly at ease

463
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:26,409
behind the wall looking down on the

464
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:29,980
naked attackers over 14 security sectors

465
00:25:26,409 --> 00:25:32,320
of course that's too much I mean it

466
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:33,880
isn't reasonable to build 14 security

467
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,220
sections one behind each other this is

468
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:38,830
more than only security game this is a

469
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,049
representation you can say this is a man

470
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:44,740
you're assisting example of a medieval

471
00:25:41,049 --> 00:25:46,960
castle of course it is but let's look at

472
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,270
more realistic examples this is a Swiss

473
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,190
example this is Castle hovel and our go

474
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:57,100
via it is a moated castle so it's

475
00:25:54,190 --> 00:26:00,700
sitting in a palm so to say it is built

476
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:03,330
on two islands on the left is the first

477
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,820
island then the second

478
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:10,389
there are several security layers here

479
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,580
of course the moat around it and there

480
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:14,740
is a drawbridge which is now hidden on

481
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:17,139
the left side between the buildings it

482
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:19,899
would have to draw bridge and then the

483
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,679
gate on the wall to give access to the

484
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:23,620
next layer

485
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,440
fighting through that door will give you

486
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,889
access to the first island and then a

487
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:32,140
new drawbridge and then you gate giving

488
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:34,059
you access to the second island and then

489
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,039
you've made you may into the second

490
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:38,260
island then you're from off the

491
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:41,190
stronghold the strong keep where you

492
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,690
only have the ground walls today

493
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:47,830
surviving they're very thick they're

494
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:50,200
like three meters thick and you need to

495
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,840
realize that these strongholds is inner

496
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,090
towers they never have a ground entrance

497
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:58,570
you have to climb to the second or third

498
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,449
third floor to meet the door to actually

499
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:04,330
get into it of course an attacker could

500
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:06,159
now say yeah let's shortcut this in hoho

501
00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,379
spirits that would have meant to climb

502
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,409
up to Hill the mountain through the

503
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:14,830
cliff here we mean to climb on a ladder

504
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:17,820
from a boat over six or eight meters to

505
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:21,629
get to the second island immediately and

506
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:26,428
climbing a mountain

507
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:30,730
in a battle situation is tricky at best

508
00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:33,880
this is a small scale very effective

509
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,510
defense architecture but there is a

510
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,370
closer one which is even tighter Shiar

511
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:42,549
at the other end of the lake geneva of

512
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:48,100
course geneva has three defence sectors

513
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:49,210
stacked on very tight together and you

514
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,709
have a bit of a modern bridge

515
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:53,740
historically that would be a drawbridge

516
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:57,190
of course no access to the first gate

517
00:27:53,740 --> 00:28:00,220
and then two additional gates until

518
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:04,419
again you're standing in front of the

519
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:08,890
preserved tower where the owner of the

520
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:10,990
castle will be hiding Shiar is extremely

521
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:14,020
well defended and it's only a little

522
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:15,820
cliff in a lake but a very beautiful

523
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:24,820
castle perhaps the most beautiful

524
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:28,509
in Switzerland good let me present you

525
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:31,289
the third solution that one is really

526
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:34,869
tricky to explain to non-techies

527
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:36,940
whitelisting well know it but on an

528
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:41,259
application-level whitelisting is just

529
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:45,729
not happening usually that is a huge

530
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:50,320
problem because whitelisting is really

531
00:28:45,729 --> 00:28:53,710
effective let me put it as follows you

532
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:56,769
have the traditional black listing black

533
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:58,119
listing is like a shield in historical

534
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,849
time unfortunately didn't bring a shield

535
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:02,830
with me they could tend to be very heavy

536
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:04,749
so no shield here but a black listing is

537
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:08,349
a shield you're putting in front of you

538
00:29:04,749 --> 00:29:11,369
against known attackers coming from the

539
00:29:08,349 --> 00:29:14,830
front you're defending against known

540
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:18,189
virus patterns with black listing

541
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:20,228
antivirus software your black listing

542
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,330
known attacks and you are aware that

543
00:29:20,229 --> 00:29:24,519
you're not protecting against the

544
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:26,739
unknowns you're not protecting your back

545
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,080
end with black listing that doesn't work

546
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:31,779
you're only protecting it from the good

547
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:36,849
thing is black policing is relatively

548
00:29:31,779 --> 00:29:40,239
easy to do it's relatively cheap but it

549
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:43,590
is not a very successful defense in the

550
00:29:40,239 --> 00:29:49,779
long run white listing is far superior

551
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:52,418
why is that the case we're looking at

552
00:29:49,779 --> 00:29:56,019
castle or the wall of magnets in Korean

553
00:29:52,419 --> 00:29:59,710
chicken in Austria and we're seeing

554
00:29:56,019 --> 00:30:02,229
arrow slits these are so-called keyhole

555
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:05,549
arrow slits because the form resembles a

556
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:09,700
kilo keyhole and that's also the purpose

557
00:30:05,549 --> 00:30:12,190
you know a keyhole it's very easy to

558
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:15,340
look through a keyhole from one side and

559
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:17,349
see what your side is doing well the

560
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:22,090
attackers outside this wall they're

561
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:25,689
looking at a wall with a few small tiny

562
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:29,020
holes in it so the defense is complete

563
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:33,240
outside of small pierced

564
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:36,610
access holes so what happened here is

565
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:42,070
the defenders reduce their attack

566
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:46,060
surface to a maximum level they're

567
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:50,560
ruling this game here they are forcing

568
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:53,649
the attacker to hit these holes because

569
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,290
either your gun is so incredibly huge

570
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:58,180
your blaster where your walls and that's

571
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,860
really hard to do I need to be a

572
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:04,000
nation-state attacker at least to

573
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:06,399
perform that or you're fit you bullet

574
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,800
through that hole and that is probably

575
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,950
out of question for you that's too hard

576
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:15,310
for you you're going to give up before

577
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:17,440
you achieve that so here we clearly see

578
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:20,710
that defender rules the attack defense

579
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,210
game here the attacker has to adopt not

580
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:25,300
the other way around anymore

581
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:29,440
that's why whitelisting is such a great

582
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:32,710
defense mechanism this is the inner side

583
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,010
of the wall arrow slits are usually

584
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:40,530
built in a funnel to give the defender a

585
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:44,440
bit of maneuvering against the attackers

586
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:46,980
so they have a good field of vision they

587
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,230
can shoot and all the attackers outside

588
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:55,780
while the attackers have a hard time

589
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:58,990
seeing the defenders at all and all the

590
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:04,090
the hits they score a more by hazard

591
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:11,020
when they randomly hit the keyhole the

592
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:12,909
arrow slit Rebecca hoho Surratt's this

593
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,260
is one of the gates you have seen one in

594
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:16,750
the center the so-called

595
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,650
arms gate don't look at the square

596
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:23,200
windows they've been later additions

597
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:26,230
look at the vertical arrow slits three

598
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,930
on top and two lower below this is a

599
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:31,990
different form a different evolution

600
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:35,110
step four arrows slits here they've

601
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:37,720
taken the concept and put it them into a

602
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:40,479
vertical form the vertical form has

603
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,820
advantages in this situation where you

604
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,000
force

605
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:48,990
tacker to get really close he has to

606
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,700
come very close to shoot upwards against

607
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,280
the defenders and the defenders have

608
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,740
advantage then don't even have to show

609
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:58,320
their face because they know by now the

610
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:00,090
defender is right out the gate and they

611
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:02,429
can just drop the hand create stone on

612
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:05,100
them so they forced them to come really

613
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:07,950
close and exposed themselves to hand

614
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,459
grenades they can just drop without even

615
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:14,490
showing their face this is a new step

616
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:18,090
evolution for arrow slits so this pretty

617
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:21,300
much evolved through the centuries until

618
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:24,090
the early 20th century when people gave

619
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,220
up on military fortresses to a certain

620
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:29,659
extent and then war became much more

621
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:32,760
dynamic of the First World War of course

622
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:36,510
but it doesn't mean that the fortress

623
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,360
are over physical security is still

624
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:42,510
going very strong it's just not so much

625
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,840
use in war situations anymore but of

626
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:48,900
course banks are still defended with a

627
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,939
lot of sirak physical security because

628
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:55,490
we know that really works and we have to

629
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,490
experience to build very strong saves

630
00:33:55,550 --> 00:34:00,419
let's put the arrow slits in context

631
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:03,360
this is the Tower of London you've

632
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:06,330
certainly seen it before and here

633
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,830
there's a whole wall it's a system of

634
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:15,179
all with arrows slits in the form of a

635
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:18,590
cross here the attacker again he brings

636
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:23,659
huge guns to blast through the walls or

637
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:26,490
he manages to hit the tiny arrow slit

638
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,799
openings that's probably out of question

639
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:31,830
but in other words you're actually

640
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,640
looking at a network firewall all the

641
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:39,750
bricks in this wall are UDP or TCP ports

642
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,810
and most of the ports are closed there

643
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:45,210
were only a few open pores nicely laid

644
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:48,389
out this is the minimal openings

645
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:50,610
necessary for the service of the castle

646
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:55,120
first service of the defenders and all

647
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:57,670
the rest is closed to the attackers so

648
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,650
the defenders completely rule this game

649
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,320
and now you understand while the six

650
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:05,230
blokes on the city of Damascus happily

651
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,120
standing on top of the wall looking down

652
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,700
and laughing at the thousands of

653
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:15,250
attackers because they know this wall is

654
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:19,120
going to stand for a long long time good

655
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:21,640
final part of my presentation the useful

656
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:24,060
security practices you've heard a lot of

657
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:28,660
talks about security updates of course

658
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:30,029
security updates are a bore but they're

659
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:33,370
very important

660
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:37,860
we kind of know but then we become

661
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,859
sloppy again and many organizations are

662
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,960
here you see a photo of the company

663
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:54,160
Equifax the morning it was breached

664
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:59,040
Equifax was defended with in theory nice

665
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,810
fireball in the form of a moat it has a

666
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,779
positive security or a whitelisting

667
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:08,100
setup meaning that you're only able to

668
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:11,380
access the castle over the little bridge

669
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:13,750
unfortunately it seems that the rules

670
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:15,490
have all been flushed the moat is empty

671
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:18,340
and of course that firewall doesn't

672
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:22,120
serve any purpose whatsoever anymore the

673
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,520
excess layer of the reverse proxy the

674
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:27,520
internet gateway hasn't seen a lot of

675
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,230
maintenance lately you could argue that

676
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,170
it hasn't been patched for several

677
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,080
centuries it's probably the situation

678
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:38,260
they face at Equifax and of course here

679
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,540
you don't need a 10-fold majority

680
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,540
anymore to attack that company or that

681
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,029
castle the defense practice has been so

682
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:49,390
sloppy it takes a couple of script

683
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,880
kiddies with an off-the-shelf exploit to

684
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:53,920
conquer this castles and the application

685
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,170
layer and the database layer aren't

686
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,780
looking much better either the first

687
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,930
cracks are clearly visible this is no

688
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:04,930
match for a dedicated attacker anymore

689
00:37:01,930 --> 00:37:06,819
and this is how a lot of companies look

690
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,950
like from a security perspective of

691
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:11,620
course and if you show that

692
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,569
photo to the guys in charge and tell

693
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:16,569
them why you need the money to really

694
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:19,750
get the security patching right it is

695
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:25,570
much more easy to understand why

696
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:28,420
patching is so damn important so be

697
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:30,640
really petty about patching your service

698
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:32,590
make this a priority in your

699
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,690
organization's you don't need to enter

700
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:37,150
the battle if you don't even have your

701
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:39,130
service patched you need to keep calm

702
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,070
total control of the patching process

703
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:43,750
and you have to make sure if you do that

704
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:45,700
you don't look like a key you

705
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:47,800
remember that detail that Equifax said

706
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,870
there was a single employee responsible

707
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,570
for the patching of all the servers at

708
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:54,940
Equifax they're filthy 14 billion dollar

709
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:56,950
company and a single person was

710
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,910
responsible and if you are like that

711
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:03,600
don't blame it the structural defects of

712
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:07,960
your organization on a single employee

713
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:10,089
it's not a way to do it second security

714
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:15,880
practice you can only defend what you

715
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:18,250
know you need a detailed inventory you

716
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,350
need something like a software bill of

717
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:23,260
materials all the things that you have

718
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:26,259
you have to know your territory you have

719
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:28,780
to know your castle by heart so when the

720
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,600
attackers come you're completely at ease

721
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:33,880
and feel at home because you know

722
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:36,279
everything is ready the inventory is

723
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,460
loaded the supplies are there we're

724
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:42,460
ready to face them so you need a

725
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:45,970
detailed inventory of all the services

726
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:48,850
all the servers all the software's down

727
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:50,740
to the library level there was research

728
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,529
coming out and they looked at Android

729
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:56,439
updates and this saw they get constant

730
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,780
updates is unridden packages are apps

731
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,360
but the updates don't involve the

732
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,430
libraries it's just the software they do

733
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,340
and they still load the old library in

734
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:10,690
the new release even if they have a

735
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:14,110
security breach here we're looking at a

736
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:16,210
rote Allah wrote Allah is a form of an

737
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,190
inventory on the roll that makes it very

738
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:20,920
hard to steal a page because a

739
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:22,660
continuous roll it's a bit like a hashed

740
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,390
lock file the

741
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:27,430
taking from Germany it's from the

742
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,520
Habsburg this is an in detailed

743
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:33,730
inventory of all of the farms and feels

744
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,530
that they own this was really important

745
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:37,810
for them because even if you want to

746
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:41,500
raise taxes you better know your

747
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:43,540
peasants and of course it should be the

748
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,160
same in your company because you need to

749
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:47,740
know all your service otherwise you

750
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:49,720
cannot patch them and you need a very

751
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,479
good visualization this is a map of

752
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:55,060
Cairo we're looking from the north

753
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:57,430
southwards on the right you see the

754
00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:00,220
Pirates obviously it is made by the

755
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:03,220
ultimen cartographer and general piri

756
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,859
reis and he was doing very detailed

757
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:08,020
Network diagrams of the cities he built

758
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,270
or a cities he attacked because you

759
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:13,120
really wanted to know them and if you

760
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:16,390
look in more detail you see just the

761
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,200
attention he he gave to all the tiny

762
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:22,960
details because today a security problem

763
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,220
surfaces you really want to know you

764
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,760
really want to know where you're

765
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:30,220
affected where it hits you so this was

766
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,990
very important for him and it should be

767
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:34,600
the same for you and there is one

768
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:37,060
difference you can do this dynamically

769
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:39,040
today you don't want anesthetic images

770
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,680
anymore of your network you want the

771
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,410
dynamic overview of the things happening

772
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,049
in your organization every day on your

773
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:49,600
servers and you're free you're affected

774
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:52,840
by security vulnerabilities you know

775
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:54,400
immediately very starts to blink ever

776
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,280
you need to do a very need to act

777
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,130
quickly returning to the final and

778
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,010
security best practice back bounty

779
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,990
programs there be less frequent

780
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:09,010
Switzerland is really into bug bounty

781
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:11,500
program so far the one of two programs

782
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,020
around we're not talking about a voting

783
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,640
in Swiss posts in this presentation but

784
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:19,990
they're apparently running a bug bounty

785
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:21,759
program right now another term use for

786
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:24,040
it is red teaming is with more and

787
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,320
capacity it's all means the same I mean

788
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:29,070
pentesting red teaming bug bounty

789
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:33,730
programs it means inviting having

790
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:36,400
attackers attack you so you really see

791
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:42,700
how your defenses stand

792
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:45,250
and this the back bounty program is the

793
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,399
final step in your security procedure

794
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,829
and it solves the problem of penetration

795
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,839
testing I know there are a lot of pen

796
00:41:50,829 --> 00:41:55,630
testers in the room I tell you what the

797
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:59,890
problem with you pen testers is there

798
00:41:55,630 --> 00:42:02,589
are two problems a pen testing is so

799
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:05,140
successful and so good companies want

800
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:08,770
more of it but it's cost a fortune

801
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:11,109
good pen testing is really expensive and

802
00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:14,619
you're hitting the limit with the bûche

803
00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:17,828
sooner or later so it's just very

804
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:21,160
expensive to do in a good way it

805
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:24,309
dedicated a committed way and the second

806
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,379
even bigger problem is pen testers are

807
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:28,299
doing what you tell them to do they're

808
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:32,440
doing their job and that's a very bad

809
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:34,480
incentive their job is basically to

810
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,329
provide you with a report and you tell

811
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,010
them please look at application a

812
00:42:36,329 --> 00:42:40,319
because that is new and dependents will

813
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:43,150
go and write the report about

814
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,130
application a because he wants to please

815
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,890
you and he wants to secure his follow up

816
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:49,539
contract of course he wants and of

817
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:50,950
course he wouldn't accept the report

818
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:52,750
about the application B when the

819
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:55,058
contract said look at the application a

820
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,750
this is where bug bounty hunters come

821
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:58,839
into play

822
00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,819
they're not here to please you they're

823
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:04,240
not here to write a report application a

824
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:06,099
they're here to score a quick win with

825
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,959
the lowest investment possible and

826
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:10,329
they're looking for the crack the

827
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,880
openings the things you overlooked the

828
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:14,920
application see you didn't remember

829
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,980
anymore because they want the fast

830
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,920
entrance into your organization a quick

831
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:23,049
win and be paid because if you don't

832
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,579
manage that they're not paid at all

833
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:27,910
they're not paid for the beautiful

834
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:30,240
report they're only paid for the attack

835
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:32,470
wins this course the goal is core

836
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,538
against you that's why they're so

837
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:40,618
successful here we see a couple of buck

838
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:42,789
pound P hunters trying to attack a gate

839
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:45,700
defenders are defending with all they

840
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:49,089
have apparently that stones I'm not sure

841
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,020
if the gate the drawbridge will really

842
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:52,470
hold

843
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:55,480
but if it does then I know that

844
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:58,120
defenders will get a good sleep

845
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,390
afterwards because they know our defense

846
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:05,230
structure has been tested by people with

847
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:07,540
the right incentives like attackers the

848
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:09,910
bug bounty hunters didn't take a lot of

849
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:12,130
orders from us they tried to walk the

850
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:16,750
way around they tried the mean stuff

851
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:20,890
against us and if our defenders defenses

852
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:26,890
stood then they're tested for the next

853
00:44:20,890 --> 00:44:28,629
real attack and here final slide we have

854
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,580
a bug bounty hunter doing a spectacular

855
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:34,000
attack that's what they do

856
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:37,270
they'll try out spectacular attacks to

857
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:40,120
try out to test all the uncommon things

858
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:42,990
and I don't know if he survives at this

859
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:46,240
attack but if he lives to tell the story

860
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:49,629
then I'm sure he'll be the hero of the

861
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,479
day with the way he flew over all the

862
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:55,810
defenses that the defenders put into

863
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:08,220
play for their castle thank you very

864
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:08,220
much we have five minutes for questions

865
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:21,460
there was one I was expecting a question

866
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:25,750
vorlix caller hello hello I was

867
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:27,760
wondering nowadays we are well people

868
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:30,330
will would say we are not in Kansas

869
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,640
anymore we're very mobile and so on and

870
00:45:30,330 --> 00:45:35,910
as you pointed out Trojan horses are

871
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,450
really an issue and it's not attacking

872
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:42,279
Trojan horses attacking directly castle

873
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:44,410
where there are few people on the

874
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,380
infants who should be schooled to

875
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:51,279
recognize a Trojan horse but it's more

876
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,740
like I'm in the wild I'm in the open

877
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,990
with a few people and I might be

878
00:45:53,740 --> 00:46:02,200
targeted by robbers or by very very

879
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:03,549
dedicated attackers how can this analogy

880
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:09,689
work

881
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:12,790
in medieval times yeah of course yeah

882
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:16,000
I'm not trying to tell you did you need

883
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,460
to take this one on one this is meant as

884
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,920
an inspiration and if they did layered

885
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,800
offenses back in the day you need to

886
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,560
think how can we do a layered offense on

887
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,180
a mobile phone how does it work and of

888
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,430
course people nowadays when they have

889
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,339
important data assets on the mobile

890
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:36,250
phone they're using sandbox environments

891
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:40,240
on the mobile phone so that is a layered

892
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:42,700
offense again next step could be we're

893
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,339
not holding the data on the mobile phone

894
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:47,770
we're downloading it and then raising it

895
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,350
securely immediately when we no longer

896
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:55,000
need it so there would be multiple

897
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:58,779
defense mechanism layered stacked behind

898
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:01,600
each other so the basic idea is have

899
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:04,150
multiple layers of defense and stack

900
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,470
them behind each other and how can you

901
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:09,900
map this pattern on a mobile modern

902
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:13,089
situation where you're out in the cloud

903
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:16,270
how do you go about this how can you

904
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:18,940
defend yourself against the host system

905
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:22,930
underneath with spectrum meltdown in a

906
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:25,780
while so you cannot take brick and

907
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:28,629
mortar and transform it the modern world

908
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:32,170
immediately you need to think and this

909
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,120
is why it's so hard but second purpose

910
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,610
of my talk when you take the brick and

911
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,420
mortar metaphor you Nick can explain

912
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:40,840
into management

913
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:43,200
why whitelisting is so cool and while it

914
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,460
works and let me open the bracket

915
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,689
whitelisting doesn't need to be a

916
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:51,940
complete castle if the only thing you're

917
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,760
exposing to the Internet to an

918
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:57,280
authenticated user is the login form do

919
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,920
white listing on the login form that's

920
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,840
already very very strong because the

921
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,750
rest of the application is shielded by

922
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,700
the authentication but the exposed login

923
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:09,100
form can be white listed very easily and

924
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:11,169
very few people are doing this and it's

925
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:15,779
actually quite a cheap form of white

926
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,780
listing there was a question back there

927
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,990
hi thanks you already mentioned the word

928
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:26,580
cloud yes and that the whole concept has

929
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:28,799
been said that the cloud our

930
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,620
authentication is a major security point

931
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,170
for it and everything else underneath is

932
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:37,770
not under your control how do we decide

933
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:40,830
to do any security there well I think

934
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:43,890
clouds are just a fact we have to adopt

935
00:48:40,830 --> 00:48:46,140
them somehow or I have to adopt them I'm

936
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:49,350
not a big fan but I think we need

937
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:51,750
basically the same multi tier layouts we

938
00:48:49,350 --> 00:48:54,240
built into your data centers transpose

939
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:56,340
them into clouds which is even more

940
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:58,589
difficult I think that is the only

941
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,750
answer I can give it to you but a layer

942
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:02,280
defense and I mean lady fans are

943
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:04,050
important for me because I work in the

944
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,760
access layer I work in replication

945
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:09,030
security at the front the first layer of

946
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,700
defense and I think I should be able to

947
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,560
fight fight off nineteen ninety nine

948
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,660
percent of the attacks and the access

949
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,150
layer and then the application itself

950
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:20,460
should defend itself against the rest

951
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:24,810
and this stacking of layers need to be

952
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:26,760
done in the cloud just as much hi good

953
00:49:24,810 --> 00:49:29,490
very good presentation thank you I have

954
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:32,520
a luxury of working in a financial

955
00:49:29,490 --> 00:49:33,000
institution so we we are kind of a

956
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,470
castle

957
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,870
I expect it to be a castle and I think

958
00:49:37,470 --> 00:49:42,959
in my in my experience the biggest

959
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:45,720
problem is that the management the

960
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,300
business guys not the technical guys it

961
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,549
is really hard to persuade or explain to

962
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:52,860
them that it is like even a single

963
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:55,140
player on the field that the thing that

964
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:58,440
you said at the beginning the single

965
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:59,460
goal means that we are compromised from

966
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,000
the top to the bottom

967
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,250
the nobody will look on the on the

968
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:08,310
history and the big picture but they

969
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:10,530
will say ok you failed now and I am

970
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:12,840
really having a problem because we did

971
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,820
the technical security guys know how to

972
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,780
make those whitelist you know the fans

973
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,820
and they're liars of security but but

974
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,830
they don't see that like about as a

975
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:26,970
value and and in my opinion the biggest

976
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:28,080
problem is how to build a strategy to I

977
00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:30,990
don't know

978
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:34,110
open currently for example in my

979
00:50:30,990 --> 00:50:37,740
situation the only way to persuade them

980
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:39,510
is by regulatory and this is not the

981
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,319
best idea because they don't feel the

982
00:50:39,510 --> 00:50:45,870
value so this is a tricky question maybe

983
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,990
a golden recipe how to persuade the the

984
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:53,160
board to to build a castle and maintain

985
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:54,390
it yes it's exactly my point it's very

986
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,330
hard to do

987
00:50:54,390 --> 00:50:59,330
I think the castle metaphor works it

988
00:50:57,330 --> 00:51:02,240
works very often with management

989
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:04,470
actually I'm using it successfully

990
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,879
because then they understand my

991
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:07,919
whitelisting works they they don't

992
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,640
understand the concept of whitelisting

993
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,230
if it's only cyber but when you present

994
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:13,770
him with a narrow slit oh that's the

995
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,150
idea

996
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:18,750
whose whitelisting is very hard to

997
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:21,930
explain I attended a talk a year ago at

998
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:25,260
using ex anima where it was a talk about

999
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:27,330
security awareness and the guy said or

1000
00:51:25,260 --> 00:51:29,670
he researched security awareness is that

1001
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:32,160
there are two situations where people

1002
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:36,120
are willing to change their approach to

1003
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:39,000
security one is policy it's the day of

1004
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:41,970
the certification this is when the rules

1005
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,270
are imposed and the willingness to

1006
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:48,660
change the security procedures grows the

1007
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:50,940
closer you get to day zero the closer

1008
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,819
you get to the day where you being

1009
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,100
audited the more open you are to change

1010
00:51:53,820 --> 00:51:57,570
your security process and the second

1011
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,509
situation that will be a triangle

1012
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,130
leading up and the next day back to

1013
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:05,040
normal because they are out of the door

1014
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:06,420
you have your sample ready great and the

1015
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,330
second situation is when the breach

1016
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:11,820
happens this is when the CEO almost

1017
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:14,700
loses his head because of security

1018
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:17,850
breach the next day management is

1019
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:20,250
extremely eager to raise the security

1020
00:52:17,850 --> 00:52:24,720
level of the company and then as time

1021
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:28,010
goes on this interest fades again so I

1022
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:30,240
would say you need to work with policies

1023
00:52:28,010 --> 00:52:34,050
industrial best practices that you can

1024
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:36,000
impose did you need to fulfill don't see

1025
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:38,550
them only a stupid policy and bla bla

1026
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:40,490
bla bla bla try to make the best out of

1027
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,920
them and use them as a tool

1028
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:45,259
to get the real solution not the fancy

1029
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:48,800
products but the education and the

1030
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:52,160
bareness it for your processes and be

1031
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:53,750
have it already when the breach happens

1032
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,098
then you have all our ideas bringing

1033
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,470
them on the table now we put them into

1034
00:52:55,099 --> 00:52:59,240
practice because you can fight windmills

1035
00:52:57,470 --> 00:53:01,700
for years and nobody listens to use

1036
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:03,529
until you have the security breach and

1037
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:08,540
that day you need to be ready with the

1038
00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:09,290
plan to put into practice don't have

1039
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,700
time anymore

1040
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:15,509
okay so please give them a round of

1041
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:18,649
applause thank you very much

1042
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:18,649
