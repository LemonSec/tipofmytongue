[Music]

2
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,750
so so yesterday I was talking to

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,369
networking part and you guys say wait a

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,840
minute so we have an American coming to

5
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:22,990
Europe to talk about a European

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,869
regulation and say well there's a reason

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,038
for that so so here's well by the way

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,650
you can interact about the entire

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,900
presentation I don't do for me for my

10
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:35,620
presentations anymore it becomes

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,150
difficult sometimes so this is why so I

12
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,680
have a whole bunch of job so I'm asleep

13
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,799
like four hours a night I'm not even

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:43,780
joking attorney in private practice I

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:45,970
the most what I do is help military

16
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:47,799
veterans to get their disabilities and

17
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:49,989
deal with navigating the VA system I

18
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:53,140
teach you two different universities

19
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,699
both masters and doctoral classes I'm

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:56,799
actually just finished a class up on

21
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:59,140
Tuesday while I was here for cloud

22
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:01,780
management and I have two other two

23
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,460
other ones going on right now this is

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,510
interesting especially since one of the

25
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,689
schools most of my students are

26
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:11,020
international students and also work for

27
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:13,419
the power company back home where he do

28
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,039
both the controls and compliance so his

29
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,509
last I was talking about the critical

30
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:18,310
infrastructure that's exactly what I do

31
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,469
for them I make sure they're complying

32
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,380
with the regulation that North America

33
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,350
has called Newark shield where I am in

34
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:28,509
charge of identity access management

35
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,890
vulnerability management let's see what

36
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:32,859
else is there the Nexus management

37
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:37,210
ability management arcsight cisco

38
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:40,449
security management console what else

39
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,130
the endpoint protection group policies I

40
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,450
put all the enforcement's in place and

41
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,310
also make sure that everything is fine

42
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,100
turn over evidence to the federal

43
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,869
government and on top of all of that I

44
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:52,419
am the chair of the vice chair of the

45
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:53,799
privacy in data privacy in computer

46
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,679
crime Committee for the American Bar

47
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,090
Association that's all I do I still on a

48
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,499
city government where I help plan how

49
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:04,869
the city is going to be designed and

50
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:06,399
grow I do a lot of stuff published it's

51
00:02:04,869 --> 00:02:07,749
pretty trust me that you just call this

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,490
my eye candy slide because it's like a

53
00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:10,959
whole bunch of stuff going on this this

54
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,650
is way worse than it seems

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,200
so that's who a lot published several

56
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,300
times I have the chapter lead American

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,649
Bar Association is coming out with the

58
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,010
book called the International guide to

59
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,290
cybersecurity

60
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:26,390
chapter 5 is enterprise architecture

61
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,099
systems and on the chapter Li for that

62
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:30,798
when I wrote half of that chapter myself

63
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,379
as well as wrote two or three parts of

64
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:35,659
the compliance part for them as well and

65
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:39,349
have a bunch of certifications the GP

66
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:41,540
who knows what the GPA is you don't

67
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:44,030
experience I pass the certification that

68
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,790
day before I flew over here seriously

69
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:48,379
I passed it Thursday flew on Friday all

70
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:52,810
the rest of stuff whole bunch of degrees

71
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:56,290
it's truth and what am i working on

72
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:58,040
whole bunch more stuff I don't sleep I

73
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,170
really don't sleep working on two

74
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:02,209
doctorates right now working on some

75
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:04,010
more certifications I actually bought a

76
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,019
brand new server just to take the OS CP

77
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:08,750
I can't wait to play with it has 14 core

78
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,579
service 512 gigs around I can't wait to

79
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,900
have phone that server it got here the

80
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:14,000
day before I flew out here as well so I

81
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,920
couldn't play with the yet and in my

82
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,480
spare time I watched horror movies cook

83
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,429
and I try to grow food but I can only

84
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,040
grow flowers for some reason so

85
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:25,670
questioning who and your knows about GDP

86
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,629
are already something about it perfect

87
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,768
we can skip through half of this

88
00:03:26,629 --> 00:03:30,440
presentation and get to the fun stuff

89
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:32,629
then perfect let's skip through a little

90
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,780
butch yep don't eat that part come with

91
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:37,160
that we'll get over this keep going keep

92
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,720
going oh by the way I can make these

93
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,220
slides available I can email the

94
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,500
conference and let them email everybody

95
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:47,329
else or you can email me for them skip

96
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:49,730
skip skip I forgot to put graphics in

97
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:50,629
here and go with the structure don't

98
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,060
need to structure anymore

99
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:56,149
I can go faster than this would be so so

100
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:58,639
so much fun the second half goes into

101
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:03,620
all the fun stuff this is more along the

102
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:05,239
lines of structure steel if I could

103
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:07,819
click faster this is why not put all

104
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:10,269
these graphics in here this is taking so

105
00:04:07,819 --> 00:04:10,268
much time

106
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:16,909
key components ok so the reason why this

107
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:18,440
is all in here is I actually turn I

108
00:04:16,909 --> 00:04:20,238
actually did a presentation relates the

109
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:23,030
same subject about two months ago in

110
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,349
Florida so they had to have to give them

111
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,570
the whole background about all the stuff

112
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:29,780
so bear with me we'll get to the fun

113
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:33,169
part in a little bit keep going keep

114
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:34,429
going keep going we have 45 minutes so I

115
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:35,870
figure I would make better use of your

116
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,570
time by getting to the function

117
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:39,980
I only got to that slot in Florida

118
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:43,790
because we were talking the entire time

119
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:48,970
in our conversation everybody knows

120
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:52,160
about the fines recap issues number two

121
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:58,419
perfect now with the fun stuff I think

122
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,419
yes GPR and cloud technologies so I

123
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,830
really don't remember doing all this so

124
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,840
these are the three biggest cloud system

125
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:12,200
providers globally in the world Google

126
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,789
AWS as well as Azure azureus I like the

127
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,469
small puppy in the room it's kind of

128
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:17,960
like Mighty Mouse wanting to come in and

129
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:19,580
take over everything interestingly

130
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,590
enough we're gonna talk about Google

131
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:24,620
again later because that's that's really

132
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,539
funny so Google has has a directive out

133
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,950
that states that they will assist you

134
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,680
and making sure that you're GE are

135
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,930
compliant most of them the way Google

136
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,850
has their setup is depending upon which

137
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,550
one of their cloud services you have it

138
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,470
determines the percentage of control

139
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,539
that they're caught that they're taking

140
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,740
responsibility for of course all the

141
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:44,539
cloud system providers are going to be

142
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,030
called your data processors as far as

143
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:49,969
your PRS concern but every single one of

144
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:51,859
them has a shared responsibility because

145
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:53,180
you can't get rid of it can get rid of

146
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:58,700
your responsibility by making them the

147
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,910
processor interestingly enough you have

148
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,780
the storage providers as well this is

149
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,720
where it gets kind of interesting

150
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,388
because one thing that gdpr

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,740
effectively requires is your data at

152
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:11,240
rest you'd be encrypted

153
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,410
that's a shortest version of describing

154
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:17,810
you however I can promise you unless you

155
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,310
put it encrypted on one of these and one

156
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:21,470
of these service storage providers is

157
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,760
not going to be encrypted I can upload a

158
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,800
word document right now that would

159
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,450
reasonably I have to encrypt stuff you

160
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,070
have to do it yourself which actually

161
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,919
goes into our best practices I think we

162
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:32,900
want to talk about later I put these

163
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,990
slowest transitions in the world on here

164
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,669
okay cloud concerns data and trends that

165
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,800
one thing that is effectively required

166
00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,409
by GTR is that the data being

167
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,789
transferred be encrypted it gets even

168
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,320
more interesting when you're going to

169
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,570
cross borders when you're going to

170
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,110
transform data across countries across

171
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,520
different borders there was a

172
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,600
slide on there talked about the earlier

173
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,570
but there's some there are some

174
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,890
countries for example Sweden is one

175
00:06:53,570 --> 00:07:00,570
Switzerland's one the United States is

176
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,550
one only by a small specific requirement

177
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,070
are they able to explicitly transfer

178
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,720
data other than that you can't transfer

179
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:08,159
data into through other countries which

180
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,170
gets interesting when you're sorry when

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,580
you start talking about all the

182
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:14,670
different cloud service providers have

183
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,620
servers to sit in other countries you're

184
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:18,780
transferring data most servers most

185
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,510
companies even with myself

186
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,429
you have servers sitting in more than

187
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,140
one place or more than one drive to

188
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:26,460
backup your data if you don't backup

189
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,169
your data you're running into a problem

190
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,710
everyone knows good practices to backup

191
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:31,430
your data

192
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:33,840
where's your server one thing the GPR

193
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,790
suggests you to do is map out the data

194
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,979
flow of your entire data to make sure

195
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,820
you know where your data is transferring

196
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,510
what countries our data is going through

197
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:43,650
data at rest

198
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:47,010
these men teaming up with someone's head

199
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:48,539
okay so one of the paper that I

200
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,690
published a while back was talking about

201
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:55,020
the encryption keys my recommendation as

202
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:57,390
a lawyer is always to control your own

203
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,490
encryption keys if the if the cloud

204
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,710
service provider insists on them

205
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,620
encrypting the data themselves for

206
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,180
transmission my advice is always then

207
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,860
you encrypt it before you give it to

208
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,360
them have two levels encryption only

209
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,590
give them encrypted data let them

210
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,900
transfer whatever they want to do

211
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,299
encrypt it maintain your own encryption

212
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:18,060
keys from a legal standpoint here's the

213
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,970
reason why say for example the

214
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,460
government comes in and they say you

215
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,730
know what we believe that they do you

216
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:29,280
have containing some kind of horrible

217
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:30,510
things give us your data well you may

218
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,710
have a contract that says what am I

219
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,450
going to give this data up unless you

220
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,490
give me a legitimate reason why give me

221
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,040
a search warrant okay some point

222
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,930
give me a search warrant and I still may

223
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,130
ignore it well the reason why you can

224
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:42,719
get away with that is if you hold the

225
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,760
encryption keys how they gonna get the

226
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,500
data they can't just go to say Google

227
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,910
and say give this person's data if you

228
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,520
hold the encryption keys because they're

229
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:51,990
still held jumbled data anyway so always

230
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:56,670
keep your own encryption keys is

231
00:08:51,990 --> 00:09:01,200
extremely important now we get into GPR

232
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:03,089
in privacy at its core GPR is not a

233
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,249
privacy regulations

234
00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:09,629
it's a regulation over data protection

235
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:11,669
but it effectively forces privacy it's

236
00:09:09,629 --> 00:09:14,039
kind of like in the u.s. in the

237
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:16,379
Constitution of the United States there

238
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,959
is not expressively said that a person

239
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:21,209
has a right to privacy in the u.s. the

240
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,779
course interpreted to be privacy that's

241
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:26,488
armless similar to what GPR is done it

242
00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:27,629
doesn't explicitly say you're gonna make

243
00:09:26,489 --> 00:09:29,099
sure that everybody gets their own

244
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,489
privacy it says you're gonna make sure

245
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:38,419
their privacy occurs so it's a matter of

246
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:41,579
interpretation the difference between

247
00:09:38,419 --> 00:09:43,589
privacy itself in GPR so I guess the

248
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,939
usual way of describing this is GDP our

249
00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:46,499
system type of privacy is like the

250
00:09:44,939 --> 00:09:48,779
easiest way of describing this slide

251
00:09:46,499 --> 00:09:50,699
right here privacy you key you're

252
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,469
working to protect someone's data

253
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:54,899
protect someone's information from

254
00:09:52,469 --> 00:09:57,479
hackers from leaks even from internal

255
00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,919
internal threats ensuring enough a lot

256
00:09:57,479 --> 00:10:00,719
of people realize so much insider

257
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,968
threats calls data leakage that happen

258
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:05,009
constantly a threat doesn't necessarily

259
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:06,869
mean disgruntled or or a malicious

260
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:08,219
person within your company it could be a

261
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:10,229
person who just forgot to disconnect

262
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:12,179
something and left it running insider

263
00:10:10,229 --> 00:10:13,769
threat is a real serious scenario and

264
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,869
can cause a lot of problems when you're

265
00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:19,949
talking about a regulation that requires

266
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:21,599
protection of data for cloud Google

267
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:23,218
actually said that I'm gonna have so

268
00:10:21,599 --> 00:10:25,169
much fun with Google in a minute Google

269
00:10:23,219 --> 00:10:28,499
actually said that their cloud services

270
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:30,718
are ISO compliant which basically says

271
00:10:28,499 --> 00:10:32,309
that well I'm gonna call this part

272
00:10:30,719 --> 00:10:33,509
basically it says that you will make

273
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:35,129
sure you have a process in place to

274
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:37,279
check the data where the data is going

275
00:10:35,129 --> 00:10:39,809
that there will not be any data leakage

276
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:44,249
basically a DLP program which we're

277
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:46,379
cover on the next slide as well no

278
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:49,079
actually yeah DLP how many people know

279
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,239
what data loss prevention is perfect

280
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,809
have a next question who in here knows

281
00:10:51,239 --> 00:10:56,489
how to write scripts who here knows how

282
00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:57,139
to write a script to Kure to look for

283
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:01,769
the data

284
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:03,299
it's a query to look for other data same

285
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,939
exact thing basically just make it

286
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:08,218
really simple when they get the software

287
00:11:04,939 --> 00:11:09,569
if you're using the cloud provider you

288
00:11:08,219 --> 00:11:13,649
might want to check and see if there is

289
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:16,618
so 27 0 18 compliant mostly because of

290
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,370
data leakage but again if you're

291
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:21,410
encrypting data before

292
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:25,589
you transfer them makes a lot easier GPR

293
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:28,079
doesn't exactly say that you have to

294
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:29,880
have it sitting at rest in encrypted but

295
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,940
it gives the suggestion a strong

296
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,930
recommendation that that's what you do

297
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,210
it's kind of interesting we think about

298
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,040
it says we say strongly suggest you do

299
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,900
this anytime you see a strong suggestion

300
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,430
in any regulation basically it says do

301
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,720
it that's the short version of it just

302
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:46,650
do it because they're gonna find a way

303
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,920
to for charging for it anyway I found

304
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:51,990
this compliance matrix online cloud

305
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,250
Assurance Alliance actually forgot I've

306
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:55,950
actually on one of their work groups as

307
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:58,050
well my CCS kailash's and cloud security

308
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,480
came from them they have a compliance

309
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,849
matrix that that's the exact name of it

310
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,250
it's called cloud compliance matrix it

311
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:07,830
gives a list of all the different areas

312
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:10,200
of technology that somebody should be

313
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:11,640
concerned with and if you go across the

314
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,350
spreadsheet I would have put up here but

315
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:16,560
it'll been really difficult to read it

316
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,630
has every single regulation and that you

317
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,489
could possibly think of and tells you

318
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,470
exactly where it falls into that into

319
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:26,790
that area for every regulation from

320
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:30,180
Newark sub to GDP R for example it tells

321
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:33,000
you exactly where those areas fall it

322
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,689
was last updated November the 12th of

323
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,670
2018 and if I remember correctly if you

324
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,320
all came please download this thing it

325
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,360
makes life so much simpler for you trust

326
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
me it tells you where to go to find the

327
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:48,390
areas that you're going to fall under

328
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:54,060
fall into a regulatory problem will next

329
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:55,770
part yay concerns in future so right now

330
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,790
everybody is doing a lot of internet of

331
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,390
things um I'll put myself out there who

332
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:04,380
other than me has cameras on the house

333
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:05,699
we're gonna have some real phone that

334
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:07,860
with a little bit somebody actually got

335
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,200
fine for that we talked about that and

336
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,029
pheenoh coming up slide anything is

337
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,100
there everything is connected now I'm

338
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:16,410
very particular about having a bunch of

339
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,839
holes poked into my network just to let

340
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,540
devices couldn't get out you have miss

341
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,310
cameras you can control your thermostats

342
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,800
at your house from your cell phone I

343
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,849
even found a stove that you can control

344
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,189
through Wi-Fi

345
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:30,570
why don't we anyone cook with the stove

346
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:31,300
you can control through Wi-Fi that's

347
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:33,430
just asking

348
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,339
for danger and it was a gas stove - it

349
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:38,079
just makes no sense to me but everything

350
00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:39,430
started to get connected every all these

351
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,839
devices are connecting with each other

352
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,279
the stove is talking to your

353
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,970
refrigerator who's then talking to your

354
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:44,350
cell phone

355
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,089
who's then talking to your thermometer

356
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:47,230
and little while the dolls gonna have a

357
00:13:46,089 --> 00:13:49,779
caller it's other when you use the

358
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,870
bathroom it's gonna be crazy but that's

359
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:54,670
what that's what society is coming to

360
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,519
social media is talked about in gdpr

361
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,990
it's becoming an extremely gray area

362
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,070
because a lot of people use single

363
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:05,680
sign-on identification - to get on their

364
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,810
services basically they set up a profile

365
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,729
I typically run through this when you

366
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:11,439
apply for jobs or put your resume on

367
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,769
stuff they say hey you want to use our

368
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,600
service do you have facebook absolutely

369
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:17,890
all the time you have Facebook oh do you

370
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,690
have Google wonderful you have to sign

371
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,949
up oh that's just put just hit authorize

372
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,140
and what's like all your data from you

373
00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,810
that's becoming a really big gray area

374
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:31,360
because now you have data being pass

375
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:33,040
through areas that you don't control so

376
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,880
alright put this down for safety

377
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,670
insurance this was a big big question

378
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,959
that came up two months ago in Florida

379
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:44,410
someone inquired about how insurance

380
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,750
companies will address GDP are the

381
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:50,290
shortest answer I can give is the one

382
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:52,540
that all lawyers give it depends so the

383
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:56,170
reason why I depends is this your your

384
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:59,319
insurance may not be strong enough to

385
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:00,849
cover a fine from gdpr it also depends

386
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,160
on how they're going to classify the

387
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,810
insurance so for example I personally

388
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,240
have a personal liability umbrella over

389
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,439
me for 1 million dollars if I go out and

390
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,029
hit somebody I have a million-dollar

391
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,370
insurance coverage just for me by myself

392
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:13,899
outside of even my vehicles insurance

393
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,420
that's just me personally

394
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:17,860
not everybody has policy limits that are

395
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:19,689
high enough to cover them for whatever

396
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,220
they do so like not go out of town I

397
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,649
rent a car they say you want insurance

398
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,720
for what I have a million dollar

399
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:27,310
umbrella policy if I break this 30,000

400
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,410
on the car pretty sure my million-dollar

401
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:31,449
brother pass is gonna cover it now

402
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:35,560
you're getting to fine it's north of 10

403
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:37,149
to 20 million dollars it may not be that

404
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,810
wise we have just a general liability

405
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:41,460
policy because

406
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,729
insurance companies are really good

407
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,830
about modifying how they classify your

408
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:47,580
claim to determine whether they will or

409
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:50,910
will not pay you

410
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,820
whenever you file a claim insurance

411
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:56,490
company so coming by the way general

412
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,350
cybersecurity insurance by itself does

413
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,650
not generally speaking cover GDP

414
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,210
re-issues now it may if you have it if

415
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,829
you have a pasta SEP enough for a data

416
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:06,690
breach and the reason for it is data

417
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:08,430
breaches however we're going to the

418
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:10,050
slide where certain things who are

419
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:13,829
putting will fines were put on people

420
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:14,370
because of what they did versus how can

421
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,560
I put this

422
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:19,650
there were fines that were imposed on

423
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,410
companies because what they did versus

424
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:23,939
what occurred it may not be that they

425
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,010
did not give the 72-hour breach

426
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,140
notification that's required by gdpr

427
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,670
that may not be the problem it may have

428
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:32,550
it may not be the data breach at all it

429
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:35,610
may be that they decided not to disclose

430
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,020
all of their documentation to the

431
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,810
investigators when they came in to

432
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,880
decide to investigate about gdpr that

433
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,050
best would probably general liability

434
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,880
but you're going to get into an issue

435
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,099
when you get into negligence as well

436
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,460
which actually did some research in the

437
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:53,160
Union as far as how other countries deal

438
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:55,440
with their liability issues and European

439
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,870
Court it's really interesting

440
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,680
so the breach must be significantly

441
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,720
serious

442
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,699
there must be there's a rule law that

443
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,380
says the Frenchman has to occur it has

444
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,089
it has been sent to confer rights to

445
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,310
individuals and there must be a direct

446
00:17:06,089 --> 00:17:10,109
casual link between the breach of the

447
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,929
obligation resting on the states and the

448
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:14,010
damage sustained by the injury parties

449
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,160
does anybody have any idea what that

450
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,160
means

451
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:22,260
no US makes it super simple basically in

452
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,120
the US system is called negligence duty

453
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,800
brief causation damage it's effectively

454
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,679
the exact same thing is I've seen very

455
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,090
copied this from the European courts

456
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,550
directive and just modified it a bit so

457
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:33,929
I went with my plagiarism issues u.s.

458
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:36,750
system has what's called Duty breach

459
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:39,510
causation damages duty does a person

460
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,250
have all a duty to someone so I'm gonna

461
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,990
say Q cuz you're sitting right here if

462
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:45,240
you come to me for service for legal

463
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,520
services do I have a duty to do anything

464
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,070
to you the answer would probably yes

465
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,810
I'd so calling your case was there a

466
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,500
breach of anything a breach of

467
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:56,200
confidentiality a breach of

468
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,730
five - a fiduciary duty some kind of

469
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,429
recess I mean data breach is a breach of

470
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,419
a duty to do something was a breach to

471
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:07,179
that Duty if there was then we get into

472
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,830
the causation and the damages power did

473
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:10,539
you suffer this interesting we actually

474
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,000
put causations before damages because

475
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:14,650
you can't really have damages we can't

476
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,669
have causation without damages it's kind

477
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,919
of weird you have to have all four

478
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:21,490
elements so did you suffer a damage from

479
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:24,220
my duty if let's say you contracted me

480
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:25,720
to do a penetration test okay better

481
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,490
than legal be legal gets really

482
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,900
interesting I can get a legal a little

483
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:30,220
bit easier than penetration testers that

484
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,440
you contracted me to do a penetration

485
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:34,600
test I have a duty to penetrate tests

486
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,220
your company you told me you know what

487
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,600
whatever you do do not go into these

488
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,880
credit cards there's database that has

489
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,059
credit cards and party NPI information

490
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,500
in it well I'm randomly started scanning

491
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:47,440
and breaking into everything I can find

492
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:49,720
oops not have your credit card data okay

493
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,900
did you suffer a damage from that pretty

494
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:56,710
sure that PCI is going to find you for

495
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,299
that which then caused damages it's kind

496
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,860
of interestingly they put in their order

497
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:02,200
I guess because it's easier to remember

498
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,270
D duty brief causation damages when you

499
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,799
can't have damages without having

500
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:08,830
causation in vice-versa

501
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,929
Swiss legal system this one was really

502
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,439
interesting there is an article article

503
00:19:10,929 --> 00:19:16,419
102 section one of the SEC which talks

504
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,870
specifically about offences against

505
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:24,669
property Articles 137 through 172 talks

506
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:26,590
about corporate liability corporations

507
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:30,250
can be can be fined criminally liable

508
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,620
not just civilly liable for what they do

509
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:35,320
with the data or anything related to

510
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:37,270
their companies they can be both

511
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,760
criminally and civilly and um civilly

512
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,710
liable for what they do the fun part

513
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:46,059
comes in the actual harm or potential

514
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:49,179
harm most courts have been reluctant to

515
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:52,450
allow people regular citizens to sue

516
00:19:49,179 --> 00:19:55,330
companies because of data breaches so I

517
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:55,900
have a credit card yet it will give a

518
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,379
big one

519
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:01,750
Equifax had a data breach Equifax also

520
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,419
pays out X number of money and in

521
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,159
class-action lawsuits and settles rather

522
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,180
than finally get most of that by the way

523
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,740
is not because they

524
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,570
found negligent most time to do

525
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,460
class-action lawsuits and settle because

526
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,470
it's not worth the publicity issues that

527
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:16,210
are gonna come from it that's basically

528
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:19,570
with why everyone settles a class-action

529
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,630
suit because there has yet to been to be

530
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:24,159
a successful identity self lawsuit

531
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,410
against a company because of their data

532
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,690
breach it just hasn't happened yet

533
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:29,830
I personally I'm trying to make that

534
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,630
happen wouldn't be the first one to do

535
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,350
it I think it'd be pretty awesome

536
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,870
hopefully I can do it before I get

537
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,919
really really all have more gray hair so

538
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:40,479
this is where it gets fun

539
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:42,460
what is property the course is starting

540
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,440
to take an approach that your personal

541
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,430
data everything related to you in

542
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:50,860
general is your own property and the

543
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:52,720
Titan League and the u.s. system foreign

544
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:55,300
tourists you have something called libel

545
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,810
defamation you also have using someone's

546
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,399
likeness so if you hear someone i forgot

547
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:02,620
i just random things so we have a

548
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,420
celebrity who all of a sudden sees it

549
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,939
finds out that some promoter used their

550
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,530
name or their picture on their flyer to

551
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,750
advertise people coming in there and

552
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:12,580
they did not authorize it well that's

553
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,000
their property they can sue the person

554
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,770
for that but so this this concept is

555
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,510
starting to move over into the security

556
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,060
world when it comes to people's rights

557
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:25,540
and slowly starting to migrate over that

558
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:30,300
way which eventually is going to get us

559
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:33,159
to the fun part but finds outside the EU

560
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:35,710
there are play there are ways within the

561
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:38,620
legal system between different countries

562
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:43,600
to impose a fine for someone to pay

563
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:45,459
money including this 50 million euros

564
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,679
we're about to talking about in a second

565
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,350
so a lot of times people think well you

566
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,270
know what I don't my headquarters is not

567
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:54,159
in there is not an EU I don't have to

568
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,590
worry about it what are they gonna do to

569
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,120
me they gave a fine so what well do you

570
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,820
have any property over there are you

571
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:03,520
interacting with other states with other

572
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,290
countries a country can pull you there

573
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,700
if they want to especially if it's

574
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,870
criminals they thought the charge will

575
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,130
be criminal charge they can pull you

576
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:11,530
into their country and they've forced

577
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:15,130
you to pay money at that point so it's

578
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:18,100
definitely possible to have someone from

579
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,920
say Europe finally couldn't you find a

580
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,800
company who has their headquarters in

581
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,520
California in the farm being force is

582
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,010
definitely 100% possible as we're going

583
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,870
to get into him these fun examples so

584
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,440
there was an honest why should by the

585
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:37,000
cameras earlier there was a guy in

586
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:40,030
Austria who is an entrepreneur he had

587
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,490
some kind of a bedding company he put a

588
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:45,190
camera outside of his business covering

589
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:47,260
the interests of his business the inch

590
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:49,120
the camera was situated in such a way

591
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:54,430
that it covered part of the sidewalk as

592
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,899
well they find him for violating GPR for

593
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,240
having a camera outside his house so

594
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,040
it's not necessarily just the data you

595
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,020
have is what you collect which is why I

596
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,730
brought the property part up before it's

597
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,220
not just whether you collect someone's

598
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,620
name email address what they do for a

599
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:12,510
living is their picture as well it's

600
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,770
them that was a very interesting fine

601
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,260
failure secure person's data and

602
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:19,150
suffered a breach okay qoodles me I

603
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:22,120
guess you pronounce it noodles noodles

604
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,730
maybe they got fine Portuguese got fine

605
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,040
because four hundred thousand euros for

606
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:29,260
failure to ensure confidentiality and

607
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:32,740
failure to limit access I did it access

608
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:35,470
management although it goes into the

609
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,290
whole idea of security by design which

610
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,910
is what gdpr does require it does have

611
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,889
an explicitly you will have a security

612
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,720
Pauline place you a house security built

613
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:44,950
him by design doesn't tell you what you

614
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,410
have to help but it tells you you would

615
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,940
do it last one is good old Google I had

616
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,250
to talk about Google I think it's kind

617
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:55,480
of funny that Google gotta find 50

618
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:57,430
million euros two months ago but they're

619
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,040
advertising their ability to comply with

620
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,230
gdpr that's that's that's ironic in my

621
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:03,879
opinion how do you find 50 million euros

622
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:06,430
and whichever size you can keep people

623
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:12,390
complying with GPR makes zero sense to

624
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:14,500
me this is where it gets fun I

625
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:16,180
personally believe asking relevant

626
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:18,430
questions will help you get into a

627
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:20,680
situation where you are not sure whether

628
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:24,370
you're going to fall into an issue with

629
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:26,050
gdpr ask relevant questions where are

630
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:27,159
you from what country do you live in

631
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,450
when I meet people ask them a question

632
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,190
all the time so hey what do you live

633
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:32,890
where are you from it's a Memphis place

634
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,440
okay wonderful simple questions there's

635
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,000
a big problem

636
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,789
with the second part it's the

637
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,850
information relevant to the task at hand

638
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:44,490
so there's a big in my personal opinion

639
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:46,830
big problem in the in the there's a big

640
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:49,259
problem with in the retail system under

641
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,899
in the United States where you go to the

642
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:54,630
store I'm going to buy a phone charger

643
00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:56,279
at Best Buy the influence for this go to

644
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,630
buy a phone charger at Best Buy you get

645
00:24:56,279 --> 00:25:00,029
to the register the first thing they say

646
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,440
it's may have you email address to buy a

647
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:06,299
phone charger why yes or correct or your

648
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,590
zip code they say maybe email it what's

649
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,820
your zip code it's like why do you need

650
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:11,149
my zip code we want to know why our

651
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:13,439
customers come from why is it relevant

652
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:15,959
this is when you get into issues with

653
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,970
gdpr is the data you're collecting on

654
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,529
your customers really relevant for

655
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:23,039
whatever they're doing for the task at

656
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:24,450
hand if you're applying for a job okay

657
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,039
this is gonna be real fun because human

658
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,309
resources actually come in to GPR as

659
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:31,169
well if you're applying for a job as a

660
00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:33,240
security analyst that's asking someone

661
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:37,379
what their religion is relevant to their

662
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:38,850
job more than likely not but you

663
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:39,570
collected but you ask the data you ask

664
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:41,908
for that information

665
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,559
anyway asking for information that's not

666
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:46,200
relevant can get you in trouble with the

667
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,330
GD P R as well it's not whether you have

668
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,799
the data at all and you you know you

669
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:51,960
could have the data you could be secure

670
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,000
it could be encrypted it's also whether

671
00:25:51,960 --> 00:26:00,210
information was relevant for whatever

672
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:03,450
you were doing as well a conclusion when

673
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,340
in doubt delete some bigger risk I'm big

674
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,799
on risk mitigation when in doubt delete

675
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,330
all data humanly possible first thing my

676
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,490
personal opinion everybody needs to do

677
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:14,070
who may interact with their customers is

678
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:17,220
to look at every single process

679
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:19,649
procedure form every single thing you do

680
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,039
scrub in something to make sure that

681
00:26:19,649 --> 00:26:24,600
it's relevant and necessary for whatever

682
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,149
you're doing at that particular time

683
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:29,340
give people the ability to offer that

684
00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:30,719
information as a lawyer I feel all the

685
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:32,250
time if you see a clause in the contract

686
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,080
that you own like strike through it put

687
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:35,820
your initials next to it they can't

688
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,350
force it on you later you don't have to

689
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,240
always sign for every single thing that

690
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:40,529
comes in agreement most people on say

691
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,519
that I'm saying as a lawyer you don't

692
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,840
have to greet every single thing in the

693
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,669
contract you can literally strike

694
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,019
through all the different parts of and

695
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:48,600
the person handed over to the person to

696
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:50,800
make them sign out as well

697
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,959
probably get kind of fun but sure I

698
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,980
would also tell you seeker lawyer if

699
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,710
need be one who has some idea of how

700
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:02,010
privacy laws are how technology laws

701
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:04,510
working how cybersecurity laws work

702
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:06,660
finding lawyer to actually answer these

703
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:09,310
questions for you as you get to them

704
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:11,530
taking it on yourself is not advisable

705
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:13,000
in my opinion because you as we found

706
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:15,370
out from the guys with the camera

707
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,540
outside his building you may not think

708
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:19,629
that because yet you're not collecting

709
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:21,250
someone's email address to buy a phone

710
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:23,170
charger therefore you're not falling on

711
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,060
the GPR but as the cameras show coming

712
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:26,530
up it shows you something as simple as

713
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,300
having a cat massage your billion can

714
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:29,950
college you a fine the arteries when he

715
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,480
got fine four million year olds because

716
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,350
he did make enough money otherwise I was

717
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,090
taking more money they want the

718
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,260
percentage method and stay it on the

719
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,000
thing and so he make around forty

720
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:42,280
thousand euros a year so he did the

721
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:54,820
percentage of his income and any

722
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:56,200
questions yes I fast I go through this

723
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,679
thing oh I went through my thirty

724
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:01,690
minutes okay but better what that was

725
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,220
great that was very interesting yeah or

726
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,540
any kinda just drilling and rather than

727
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,010
going through all the historical poor

728
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:09,970
trust me I can talk for hours if I need

729
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:11,940
to interesting I gotta say like not

730
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:16,270
about the zip code an email address

731
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:19,030
another snafu right because you know

732
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:20,560
situation normal all up like they

733
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,720
asked this for all the time like you go

734
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,429
buy some stuff at the store what's your

735
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,020
email address what's and also you go to

736
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,960
a doctor like what's your profession

737
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:30,610
what do you do so what do we need to

738
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,880
know that right and that would be my

739
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,939
field so it's no one's gotten fine with

740
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,980
that aspect of it yet cuz I mean okay so

741
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,770
when I was in law school I had to learn

742
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,840
rephrased that they they recommended us

743
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,060
when I was in law school to learn how to

744
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,889
argue both sides of the story if you're

745
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:49,419
on one side of either a plaintiff lawyer

746
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:52,060
or defendants lord you're gonna lose

747
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:54,700
your cases so from when argue both sides

748
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,960
to this out for you I'm defendant so

749
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:58,450
therefore every is I'm representing the

750
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,749
company of the store I have the person's

751
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:03,119
email address I have their

752
00:29:00,749 --> 00:29:03,929
they're on telephones if code as well

753
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,478
zip code

754
00:29:03,929 --> 00:29:08,549
well historical data we need to know

755
00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:10,200
whether the store that's in that area is

756
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,239
relevant to the people that are serving

757
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,889
when merchandise are they buying in this

758
00:29:12,239 --> 00:29:16,200
particular area therefore we can

759
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:18,178
actually bring him more merchandise it's

760
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,190
not giving any specific information

761
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:21,769
about a person therefore the zip code

762
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:24,389
why not

763
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,039
prosecution side well you have this

764
00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:28,320
person's credit card number you know

765
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:29,820
their name as well now your tights will

766
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,249
observe cold yeah and there's if you use

767
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,408
it at the gas station to prove me right

768
00:29:32,249 --> 00:29:36,359
this is on the reason why that gets away

769
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:38,190
because your car authorizes based upon

770
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,869
your zip code for the security reasons

771
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:40,889
but when you're at when you buy

772
00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:41,999
something at the store they don't ask

773
00:29:40,889 --> 00:29:43,529
you for your zip code when you buy

774
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:45,269
something that's not why they're asking

775
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:46,950
for the information they're effectively

776
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:48,779
collecting some data on you email

777
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,210
address that's a hold of them yeah I

778
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:54,299
let's see how can I defend the company

779
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:56,309
on the email address we asked for the

780
00:29:54,299 --> 00:29:58,739
email address so we can send them offers

781
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:00,418
and coupons we gave them the choice we

782
00:29:58,739 --> 00:30:01,619
didn't tell them they had to do it we

783
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,919
didn't force them to give the email

784
00:30:01,619 --> 00:30:07,408
address basically they imply and opt out

785
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:08,279
verbally oh you give running stuff in

786
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:11,070
the decision what I do

787
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:12,269
mmm-hmm I said my action whenever I get

788
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,009
to these things will ask me for my email

789
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,139
address I literally put it in there why

790
00:30:14,009 --> 00:30:18,269
add no com a lot of you know that's

791
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:21,559
exactly I put in all those forms why and

792
00:30:18,269 --> 00:30:23,609
no calm and for name why last name is no

793
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,320
it's like my question is that we don't

794
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:27,330
have any equivalent to gdpr at the

795
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,070
federal level but I know at state level

796
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:33,389
this many things are moving so can you

797
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:35,789
comment on that at all which takes any

798
00:30:33,389 --> 00:30:38,758
any face yeah I know buck is happening

799
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:40,529
to us so California is about to pass the

800
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:43,559
law that's very that's very similar to

801
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:45,720
gdpr as well where it gives citizens the

802
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:47,820
ability to force a company to delete

803
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,739
their data verify with information that

804
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,349
California is passing a law very similar

805
00:30:49,739 --> 00:30:54,149
to that most of the laws in the United

806
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:56,189
States are related to data breaches

807
00:30:54,149 --> 00:30:59,070
so definitely talk about data breaches

808
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,139
most of all the laws focus on the

809
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:02,700
notification time whether that's a

810
00:31:01,139 --> 00:31:04,228
penalty going to be imposed which is

811
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,399
also done basically the administrative

812
00:31:04,229 --> 00:31:08,309
penalty in the long run

813
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,668
might as it pertains to whether a person

814
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:13,049
has real privacy and protection that's

815
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:14,100
not really what the states has been

816
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:17,700
focusing on

817
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,560
case in point spam yet the u.s. cared

818
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,440
about people's privacy I would not get

819
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,120
spam emails all day long especially I

820
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,920
was getting emails about home warrants

821
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,610
before I even bought my house it makes

822
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:31,860
no sense so the u.s. is concerned about

823
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:34,469
specific areas of privacy for people

824
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,689
such as they health information that's

825
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,720
that's one area they really care a whole

826
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:44,850
lot about personally identifying

827
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:48,450
information so okay how can I give you

828
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:50,969
example of this my name this is actually

829
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:52,230
100% true by the way whenever I meet

830
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,820
someone and like I don't know if you're

831
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,330
safe you might be it might be a bad

832
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,240
person

833
00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:57,750
I tell them Google me and they don't

834
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,730
believe me

835
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,680
so so the more questions someone asked

836
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:04,770
about me the more information that can

837
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:06,690
find out about me in real life why I am

838
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,300
a lawyer licensed in the state of

839
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,280
Alabama which means I'm also a public

840
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:13,169
servant at this point which means they

841
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,450
anything tied to my law practice is

842
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,800
public information and because when

843
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:18,720
you're practicing when you first started

844
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,600
practicing law it requires you to

845
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,640
actually put in your physical address to

846
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,010
apply for the bar exam my house address

847
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,870
it was on is actually published is out

848
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:29,730
there enough for it anyway whenever you

849
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,860
file and in fear any information for a

850
00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:33,090
business to incorporate a business you

851
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,860
got to give you a physical address I

852
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,030
can't use the peel box so if you do

853
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,610
enough searching you can literally find

854
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:40,350
my house you would think that someone's

855
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,870
residence would be considered private

856
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,250
information it's not why cuz you can go

857
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:45,810
see if you know the county the person

858
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,180
lives in you can go to that particular

859
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,260
county in that particular state put in

860
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,060
their name and it gives you all

861
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,330
information details about their property

862
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,919
now for some random strange reason your

863
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,750
email address is concerned to be private

864
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,290
information steal that's not going to be

865
00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:00,180
PII

866
00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:02,280
your first name last name telephone

867
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:04,650
number physical address someone can hunt

868
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,899
you and like Michael Myers and kill you

869
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:13,380
is perfectly fine but your email address

870
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:18,480
is not that's the u.s. for you thanks a

871
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:20,160
lot so obviously there's a lot of

872
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,720
inconsistency in regulation across

873
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,210
different state and federal governments

874
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:25,830
correct and obviously the regulatory

875
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,840
burden gets more and more with each

876
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:29,850
differing set of regulations do

877
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,889
thoughts about better ways to implement

878
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:36,779
things across the board or what you do

879
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:39,539
if you had your own government so we

880
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:40,919
won't go into the government part we

881
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:42,270
won't go into couple I try my best they

882
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,260
are political conversations not because

883
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:48,150
I sit in city government but because CNN

884
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,940
is interesting enough put it that way

885
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:54,330
so I won't go into all the political

886
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,830
climate part of it but I will say if it

887
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:59,010
was up to me from a business standpoint

888
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:00,779
in my advice as an attorney I might my

889
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:02,750
approach is always the risk based model

890
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:05,419
I prefer taking the risk based approach

891
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,799
if you find the most stringent

892
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:10,530
regulation in the entire world

893
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:12,330
take that regulation model what you do

894
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:14,460
off of that but also remember they all

895
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:15,540
these laws and regulations are actually

896
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:18,060
the bottom of what you should be doing

897
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:19,949
if you're constantly trying to just meet

898
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,230
regulatory compliance you're behind the

899
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:24,658
curve already you're effectively chasing

900
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:26,790
a rat at that point I won't go into my

901
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,950
many discussions with with managers and

902
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:30,989
whatnot about that by telling them the

903
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:32,908
goal is never to just meet a regulation

904
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:35,368
the goal is to go beyond the regulation

905
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:38,460
have processes in place that go beyond

906
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:39,720
the caveat to that is if you have those

907
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,030
processes in place and you're getting

908
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,730
audited any procedure you have in

909
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:48,330
writing now your new binder by that

910
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,070
procedure as well so we'll say that some

911
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:53,659
the regular the regulation the federal

912
00:34:50,070 --> 00:34:56,550
regulation may say encrypt data at

913
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:59,010
64-bit well you have a positive says

914
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,380
we're gonna always encrypt data 256-bit

915
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:04,530
encryption with double ciphers a whole

916
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,119
nine yards well so you know what that

917
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:07,410
was a dead of leakage we're going to now

918
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:10,170
audit your systems to make sure

919
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:12,420
everything was done correctly it's okay

920
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:14,190
yeah 64 and over here you have 256 and

921
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,780
over here all of a sudden you have they

922
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,060
found this one person who may be an

923
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,180
issue is at 128 well you're not in

924
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,710
compliance yes I am it's more than 64

925
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,868
but your paperwork says you're gonna be

926
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:26,580
in 256 you're not meeting your own goals

927
00:35:24,869 --> 00:35:28,290
at this point now you have a process

928
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,799
issue that's when you start getting to

929
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,839
the point of being negligent so I would

930
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,700
say go for the strongest worse you can

931
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:41,570
find and try to go above and beyond it

932
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:41,569
always and more look

933
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:54,629
you were advising to keep the encryption

934
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:57,000
keys from things in the cloud but

935
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,470
actually when you do that you lose most

936
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,970
of the functionality of the cloud like

937
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,759
everything which is related to data

938
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:08,220
sorting filtering and so on how do you

939
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,930
cope with that yellow PKR server well

940
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:12,149
still if the functionality in the cloud

941
00:36:09,930 --> 00:36:14,368
allows to sort something and has only

942
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:15,839
access to to encrypted data then you

943
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:17,970
cannot sort you can filter you can

944
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:20,190
search but before you access your data

945
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:21,598
keep in mind you have one you have two

946
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,980
different points okay so I wish I had a

947
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,750
drawing boy I would draw this I'll make

948
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,030
it so much simpler I could I guess

949
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:28,440
technically draw my laptop so you have

950
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:29,849
more than one entry points to your data

951
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,990
you first you have authenticated with

952
00:36:29,849 --> 00:36:32,460
the cloud service provided so we

953
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,410
actually get to your data in the first

954
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,240
place right from that point I'll have

955
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,040
another lock it's your P key ah

956
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,810
certificates so that when you get past

957
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,190
their first one now you're authenticated

958
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:42,630
so your data itself you get your

959
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:44,609
functionality back so it's not

960
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:46,470
necessarily the functionality of getting

961
00:36:44,609 --> 00:36:48,990
to that first door is getting past the

962
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:50,578
first door all right if you provide the

963
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:52,078
functionality but if the cloud layer

964
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,890
provides the functionality and typically

965
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,579
on a fifth 365 for example if all email

966
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,810
is encrypted

967
00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,280
you can search into the emails because

968
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:01,980
the functionality of the search itself

969
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,540
is implemented cloud side and works on

970
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,390
the data they have which is encrypted

971
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,250
data they don't go through your

972
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:08,640
decryption with your keys to sort their

973
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:12,180
data

974
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,549
okay you know what two-factor

975
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:15,868
authentication is right yeah well I

976
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:17,819
describe is no different in two-factor

977
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,750
authentication having two keys to get to

978
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:20,460
the same set of data

979
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:21,890
you're just making sure the cloud

980
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,849
provider doesn't have the second key

981
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:25,470
there's literally no difference when

982
00:37:23,849 --> 00:37:26,730
there's in fact authentication to get

983
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:28,259
into my house I use two-factor

984
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:29,490
authentication I have digital locks in

985
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,750
my house I used two factor

986
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,250
authentication to get into my house off

987
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:33,839
of that I do that for for the power

988
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,579
company to adduce affect authentication

989
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:37,470
make sure we use RSA for our in our

990
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,460
particular case so it's no different

991
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,779
when I'm described there's no difference

992
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:47,520
in fact on occasion you still have two

993
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:50,210
keys get the same set of data mmm and

994
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,210
the other question

995
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,470
thanks for your talk I have a question

996
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:03,110
about if I'm writing my own website and

997
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:06,529
I'm including Google Analytics which

998
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:11,440
what should I look out for processing of

999
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:15,050
people's information I'm using it to

1000
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:19,430
find out what the people are looking at

1001
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,990
on my website my personal website okay

1002
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:23,299
there okay so you look you talk about

1003
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:24,620
the website statistics that's not going

1004
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:29,090
to reveal any information about a

1005
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:30,970
particular person in general address IP

1006
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:33,550
addresses okay

1007
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:37,430
IP addresses can't be used to identify

1008
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:39,860
in Indian any individual person part of

1009
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,029
the data that comes along with it and by

1010
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,350
the way if I don't ask a question I'll

1011
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,370
be still file test my own I'll answer

1012
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,390
something you've the best answer I can

1013
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:46,339
give you for this

1014
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,990
even though IP addresses can be used to

1015
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,300
identify a person it's gonna take

1016
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,549
multiple in most cases multiple steps to

1017
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,800
identify person the IP address in my

1018
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:58,400
house won't get you to my name you have

1019
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,560
to go to the ISP in the hat's ISP for

1020
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,570
who get who they issued an IP address to

1021
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,580
them then get to me so that's a little

1022
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:06,470
bit different it's not the same as

1023
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:08,480
someone's social security number well

1024
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:10,640
they can get right to you in two seconds

1025
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,780
now if you know what you're doing and

1026
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,799
there's enough data leisure then of

1027
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,330
course yeah you can find out who

1028
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,780
personally has using IP addresses but

1029
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:21,890
not simple not that simple my question

1030
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:24,080
will really be why would you collect IP

1031
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,270
addresses versus collecting where area

1032
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,480
of the country someone's coming from now

1033
00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:33,940
be my first my question as a lawyer

1034
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:36,500
because it's automatically included in

1035
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:37,940
all right so we won't talk about Google

1036
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,410
in their lack of actually making sure

1037
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:42,440
things are compliant cuz we talked about

1038
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,970
that earlier but if you're not

1039
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,820
collecting the data at that look at that

1040
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,169
point you're not control this is gonna

1041
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,730
be fun so you're not really you're not

1042
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,130
necessarily controlling the data you're

1043
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,380
getting there passing data on to you at

1044
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,000
that point now what you do with said

1045
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,940
data becomes the issue of who's gonna be

1046
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,490
liable there was a problem that's what

1047
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,770
the fun part will be you're not your

1048
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:04,430
website is not exactly trying to collect

1049
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,970
any information

1050
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:11,450
about a European citizen IP addresses

1051
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:12,709
can be put into that category but it's

1052
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,060
still in my opinion would be counted as

1053
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,740
a great error you won those gray areas

1054
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,870
when it comes to EPR because even though

1055
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:19,580
you can't identify somebody by an IP

1056
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:21,350
address is not inherently what is there

1057
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:24,319
for now that going through some hoops

1058
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:30,940
and hurdles okay thanks

1059
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:36,230
no problem no questions

1060
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:38,720
yes kind of same question if I have a

1061
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:42,110
website where I start datas but I'm not

1062
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:45,439
I don't know what kind of data should I

1063
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:48,110
be compliant with Gigi Padilla because I

1064
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,690
don't know what kind of data the user

1065
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,030
will restore maybe it's addresses but

1066
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:56,930
maybe it's only the I don't know what

1067
00:40:53,030 --> 00:41:00,440
document with representation so my my my

1068
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:01,940
advice considering how you know I will

1069
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,180
give this advice even as a lawyer in

1070
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:07,940
another country my legal advice will be

1071
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,649
considering how stringent gdpr can be my

1072
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,350
advice would be to do anything humanly

1073
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:14,150
possible to to comply with it to this

1074
00:41:12,350 --> 00:41:16,640
point earlier about finding a regulation

1075
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,950
it when it comes to privacy model your

1076
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,140
privacy based upon that you have no idea

1077
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,299
what data you're collecting honestly

1078
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:24,350
that's not necessarily a good thing you

1079
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,540
need to know what all data you're

1080
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,950
collecting because otherwise you may be

1081
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,980
collecting a bunch of stuff in your

1082
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,299
servers that you really don't need we're

1083
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,040
not even talking about dealing with

1084
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,210
someone's privacy issue at that point

1085
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,650
we're talking about the amount of stuff

1086
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:38,810
storage you're taking in at that point

1087
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,030
you really need to know what you have

1088
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:42,770
same concept in the u.s. if you receive

1089
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,330
stolen goods you can say well I didn't

1090
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:46,490
know it was stolen it doesn't matter you

1091
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:47,630
have possession of it then they have a

1092
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:48,950
saying in the middle of doing the same

1093
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,690
in the u.s. their possession is

1094
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:52,069
nine-tenths of the law you have the data

1095
00:41:50,690 --> 00:42:04,310
you really need to know what you have up

1096
00:41:52,070 --> 00:42:08,930
front more questions okay my pen chess

1097
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:11,660
guy thank you

1098
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:16,620
would you say that the GDP is effective

1099
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:19,589
to protect privacy of European citizen

1100
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:21,600
effectively yes it's not it's not there

1101
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,130
to help a business whatsoever it's the

1102
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,779
reason why they have the fire of the way

1103
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,240
it is the fires were set up in such a

1104
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:29,490
way to bankrupt companies if they want

1105
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,129
to is set up in a way to to make a point

1106
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:34,649
to make a statement that's honestly what

1107
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:36,120
was said to do and oh by the way there's

1108
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,460
one interesting parts of the finds it's

1109
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,779
not just the ten twenty then the two to

1110
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,610
four percent i keeps talking about

1111
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,230
there's also this wonderful thing to us

1112
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:44,730
we call class-action lawsuits forgot to

1113
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,920
mention this earlier is very important

1114
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,230
class-action lawsuits is effectively

1115
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:52,020
when you have multiple citizens then

1116
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:52,560
they turn over their rights over to the

1117
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:54,060
government

1118
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,130
whoever cover may be in the circular

1119
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,029
case they can then find you an unlimited

1120
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,460
amount of money

1121
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:00,810
ergo google and their fifty million if

1122
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,910
they affect you if you have multiple

1123
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,799
stages turn over their rights you have

1124
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,120
unlimited fine potential they can

1125
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,550
literally bankrupt but come to me if the

1126
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:10,830
company if they want to as a matter of

1127
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,870
fact in when I was in Tampa there was a

1128
00:43:10,830 --> 00:43:14,490
company that was operating in Germany

1129
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:19,160
and I forgot all the location somewhere

1130
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:22,080
in the US and their app that they had

1131
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:24,480
they had so many difficulties and issues

1132
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,980
dealing with gdpr that they effectively

1133
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,240
them getting shut down they had to shut

1134
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,100
down the operations in Germany

1135
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:31,200
altogether and just kept everything in

1136
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,870
the US and then redid the entire thing

1137
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,910
it's the it's effectively designed to

1138
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:37,230
take effort to go out the companies so

1139
00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:44,430
it's a hundred percent debtor protecting

1140
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:48,150
you the citizens more questions more

1141
00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:49,980
questions we have time yes we still have

1142
00:43:48,150 --> 00:43:55,050
time if you all wanted one between you

1143
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,920
and coffee as well so I understand then

1144
00:43:55,050 --> 00:44:02,949
thank you for this informative talk

1145
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,949
[Applause]
