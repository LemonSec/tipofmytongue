2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:19,980
hello dear colleagues hello dear friends

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,900
before I start my presentation I know

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,540
it's difficult after lunch after the

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,610
gothic break I want to ask you to stand

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,410
up please all of you without no

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:30,330
exception I know it's difficult but

8
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:37,170
aiming them say that we have to stand up

9
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:39,900
right all of you thank you and I just

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,309
want to ask you some questions and if

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,170
you agree with the question with the

12
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:50,729
statement take a seat three question

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:55,159
first question if you think that cancer

14
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:59,400
or catastrophes kill more people than

15
00:00:55,159 --> 00:01:00,350
cyberattacks take your seat I repeat the

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:04,260
question

17
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:06,390
okay okay if you think that catastrophe

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:09,150
or cancer kill more people than

19
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:14,970
cyberattack take you take you seed the

20
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:20,310
second question if you think that cyber

21
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:22,380
attack can kill a man and this is

22
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,830
another scenario for blockbuster take

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:29,429
your seat okay

24
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,310
few few of the skeptics here the last

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,560
question if you think that your personal

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,780
medical record right now is in safe

27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,720
place take your seat

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:47,190
there are a few skeptics guys like me

29
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:48,630
and please take your seat and I try to

30
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,539
show you and I try to break your

31
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:56,520
skepticism and try to show you how our

32
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,860
smart CD can kill people can stow your

33
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,800
medical data and how our smart

34
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,070
connection connected medicine becomes

35
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:09,538
stupid and I want to start from the sad

36
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:12,450
statistic this is a old-school statistic

37
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:16,529
like four or two years ago but it is

38
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:20,548
still actual 300,000 people dies

39
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,540
annually in the United States only due

40
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:26,709
to medical records a

41
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,469
and due to doctors mistakes this is the

42
00:02:26,709 --> 00:02:32,680
third reason of death in the United

43
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:36,430
States only and as I said this number is

44
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,969
always increased so and the wrong

45
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:44,439
diagnostic is not main reason of death

46
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:46,629
and low qualification of doctor is not a

47
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:48,638
main reason the wrong therapeutical

48
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:52,719
procedures and tactical procedures this

49
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:54,819
is main reason of death so it happens

50
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,358
because our medicine becomes connected

51
00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:00,790
and a few years ago at largest in the

52
00:02:58,359 --> 00:03:04,120
industry medical event we are predicted

53
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:07,209
that the number of incidence in medicine

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,969
will be increased and this year in the

55
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:12,310
last year is not an exception we have

56
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:15,900
seen a lot of news newspapers a lot of

57
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:18,129
presentations when attackers tried to

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,500
exfiltrate the medical data from the

59
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:23,828
medical record networks or try to

60
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:27,280
encrypt the medical data and try to

61
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:29,079
paint the ransom or how they try to use

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,030
open source intelligence to find

63
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:33,639
something that something medical in

64
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:37,329
medical infrastructure so a number of

65
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:40,359
incidents leakage bridge will be

66
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:42,840
increased this year too it becomes real

67
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:45,729
reality the cures the medicine is

68
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,919
connected it's a smart nowadays what I

69
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:51,790
mean smart and connected there are a lot

70
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:54,129
of huge machines like MRI CT car

71
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:56,409
Telegraph's whatever else they are

72
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:59,500
connected to the classic tcp/ip networks

73
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:01,629
or if it's old-school style of machines

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,489
they're connected to the computers using

75
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,798
proprietary protocols but those

76
00:04:03,489 --> 00:04:10,030
computers connected to the tcp/ip

77
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,099
network you know most of cases this

78
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,620
networks medical networks connected to

79
00:04:12,099 --> 00:04:17,199
the parks servers but it's something

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,940
like the nest storage in your flat you

81
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,859
know what is the nests of course so if

82
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,710
the special storage fax is a special

83
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:25,508
storage for medical pictures for DICOM

84
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:28,810
pictures for medical purposes for the

85
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:31,800
doctors and sometimes you can find this

86
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,900
pack servers and even this MRI machines

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,130
available for everyone and connected to

88
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,260
the Internet

89
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:43,810
but it's still actual for example if

90
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,180
your PIN census or Sheldon or zoom I or

91
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:50,500
whatever else or Google you will find

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,180
that if you use the keywords DICOM that

93
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,610
come as a protocol for medical exchange

94
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,930
that data exchange and the special port

95
00:04:54,610 --> 00:05:00,250
you will find the tons of DICOM servers

96
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,020
probably some of them in our honey pots

97
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,940
but anyway you will find something

98
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,729
interesting there and this is a set

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,040
statistic that almost more than thousand

100
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,080
servers that come servers available for

101
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,450
everyone with the personal medical data

102
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,240
with the ability to spoof information

103
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:18,550
with ability to steal information there

104
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,800
this is not an exception when you try to

105
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,990
find something like SMB protocol using

106
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,090
the shutdown and a keyword like medical

107
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,820
clinical or something like that

108
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,460
plus SMB protocol you can find the ton a

109
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,610
lot of interesting information related

110
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,710
to the topology of medical networks or

111
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,200
medical facilities or pharmacy

112
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:40,810
facilities this is a useful info for

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,539
targeted attacks for lateral movement

114
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:46,480
for animal for initialization stage etc

115
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:49,210
or if you perform if your pens Astro

116
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:51,610
security consult or you will see that if

117
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,979
you get an order please make some

118
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:55,900
security assessment for me from the

119
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,670
doctor ordered from the medical facility

120
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,250
you will see a lot of interesting stuff

121
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:02,140
inside on the in the network this stuff

122
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,910
not related to the business processes

123
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,280
there are a lot of services that you can

124
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:10,120
recognize that it's probably useful not

125
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,950
only for doctors half life engine in the

126
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,760
network this is a real case real

127
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:18,760
scenario where we ask for what do you

128
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,890
need the half life doctors say that I'm

129
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,909
a man I'm a human and just want to spend

130
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,320
the time and lunch somehow hello ok doc

131
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,300
and using this information you can move

132
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:30,280
laterally to the sensitive servers

133
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,410
inside because it's not difficult to

134
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,590
recognize which is for medical purposes

135
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:39,250
which is for just a classic tcp/ip

136
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:42,039
machine like classic endpoint and this

137
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,169
info that I've crawled it from the

138
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,710
shoulder and I've crawled out from the

139
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:52,490
real security assessment propose the two

140
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,590
for me what what is it threat landscape

141
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,270
currently threat landscape for mythical

142
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:58,979
and from a suit achill organization it's

143
00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,159
a first question and second questions

144
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:04,530
while already happens there what kind of

145
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,229
malware what kind of targeted attacks in

146
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:11,638
the active stage right now in medicine

147
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:13,139
and to provide the answer how they have

148
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,210
the cybercrime appears in the mythical

149
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,690
networks I've tried to make some

150
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:22,198
reconnaissance using the masks can I

151
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:26,160
just extract the IP addresses the hope

152
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,770
for all organizations all IP range that

153
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,030
contain the keywords medical clinical

154
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:35,370
health care surgery etc in the network

155
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,590
name I've extract the tons of IP

156
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:40,860
addresses and I launched the scan and

157
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:43,020
maps can to identify which ports are up

158
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,650
in it there I have received like after

159
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:49,289
few weeks of scanning I received the

160
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:52,530
huge Reppert that I've tried to purse

161
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:54,570
and I've just recognized what is the

162
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:57,388
most popular ports in medical networks

163
00:07:54,570 --> 00:08:01,860
open it words of course it's a classical

164
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:04,229
ports like their applications DNS the

165
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,539
mail servers etc etc but I think this is

166
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:09,300
a tip of iceberg the most interesting

167
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,940
part is the bottom of the statistic

168
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,199
it's a strange port that I've extract

169
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:19,199
and using the tool Z tag that we cognize

170
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,659
the banner of the service and this tool

171
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,860
just mapped the banner of the servers to

172
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:27,770
the category of what kind of devices of

173
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,180
what kind of software behind this sport

174
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:34,770
and I've seen that there's something

175
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:37,289
embedded I've tried to make some scan

176
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,848
again and just see that there are a lot

177
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,338
of interesting stuff the building

178
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:44,610
information optimation systems escapes

179
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:46,079
like SCADA printers FTPS so this is a

180
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,910
strange and I think that the good point

181
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:51,599
to start the research right behind this

182
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,079
embedded stuff and let's start from the

183
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,240
building of tomato system I think our

184
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,849
modern buildings like this one like this

185
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,220
hotel or this venue contain the building

186
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,340
automation what is that is the huge

187
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,960
router

188
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,750
that probably is something under the

189
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:11,279
floor that connects different kind of

190
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:14,740
systems light system power system

191
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,490
conditioner system water and classic

192
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,640
tcp/ip network in the 1-1 rotor and we

193
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:23,380
know some researchers like two years ago

194
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,199
present at a different conference that

195
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,470
guy can plug into the power socket plug

196
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,480
his stuff and can send the comment to

197
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:34,600
the tcp/ip network using the issues in

198
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,950
this rotor that's interesting so I've

199
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,000
started to scan for the building

200
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:39,310
automation system and mythical

201
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,130
organization and I've identified that

202
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:45,729
there are no actual version no updated

203
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:48,070
version at all you can find the critical

204
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,520
exploits using the public databases like

205
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:53,440
CVE

206
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:56,730
where exploit to be and it will work or

207
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,430
look under this stuff this is a printer

208
00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:01,930
printer on the mythical perimeter

209
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:05,500
without any identification and

210
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:08,109
authorization you can just connect it to

211
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:11,020
this and then you can extract some stuff

212
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,700
from the printing pool some sent

213
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,880
probably some sensitive documents or

214
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,310
name of the documents or you can use if

215
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,589
the printer is modern printer connected

216
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,530
to the Wi-Fi you can use the printer for

217
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:30,339
lateral movement like initial stage of

218
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:35,189
targeted attack or look at this port for

219
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:37,810
2000 if you try to Google what is that

220
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,740
you will discover that some medical

221
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:43,930
health care clinical organization have

222
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:48,220
this stuff on the perimeter what do you

223
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:51,130
think what is that it most popular in

224
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:53,830
the United States because this is a

225
00:10:51,130 --> 00:10:56,800
smart kiddo that's quite popular in the

226
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,860
United States and this kiddo located on

227
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,650
the perimeter and this kiddo has some

228
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,240
public available exploits that allows

229
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:08,319
you to connect using the Bluetooth and

230
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:13,750
password six zeros then you can extract

231
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:15,760
the Wi-Fi connection account from the

232
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,090
embedded system easily

233
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,189
and you can use this kettle like a start

234
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:25,690
point for targeted attack through the

235
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:29,400
mythical Wi-Fi network or in medicine

236
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:32,410
there are a lot of proprietary mobile

237
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,270
devices like electro rate sonography

238
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:35,260
it's difficult to pronounce

239
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:37,300
electroretinogram what is that I don't

240
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:39,250
know I know not I'm not a doctor but as

241
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:41,459
far as I know is the thing that allows

242
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,380
you to scan the retina of your eye and

243
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:47,350
then it precedes some some kinds of

244
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,470
diagnostic for for yours state body

245
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,720
state and then based on your retina it

246
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,360
generates the PDF report then you plot

247
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,850
you can plug this stuff to the your

248
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,620
computer using the USB and generate that

249
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,090
report will be exported from the

250
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:04,240
electorate sonographer to your PC and

251
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:07,360
that's it it's quite simple but you can

252
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,640
find the firmware for the elixir in

253
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,530
stenography you can easily extract the

254
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,730
firmware and you will see lots of

255
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:16,030
interesting binaries proprietary

256
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,480
binaries that proceed not only ratina

257
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:22,000
but also the QR code from the patient

258
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,980
record classic patient paper record is

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,140
just to build the PDF report and that's

260
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:31,480
it you scan the retina of the patient

261
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,100
you scan the QR code of the patient and

262
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:36,100
that's it you compile the report using

263
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,610
this stuff but if you try to reverse

264
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,540
what happens when you scan the QR code

265
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:43,240
you will see that there are no

266
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,180
sanitization of scanning and as a result

267
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,270
you can craft you can build the

268
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:52,209
malicious QR code and create the

269
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,220
malicious PDF report that will be

270
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,950
spreaded around the doctors and medical

271
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,780
facility I think that's a mostly

272
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,230
theoretical scenario but it still could

273
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:06,400
it could happen or look and this port

274
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:07,870
MQTT protocol what is mqtt and could see

275
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,449
the spiritual communication protocol

276
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:12,160
between io TS so you don't need a human

277
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:13,690
you didn't need the classic PC to

278
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
communicate between for example smart

279
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:17,620
bulb and a smart kiddo

280
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,900
and there are a lot of in the medical

281
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:22,600
facilities a lot of MQTT based things

282
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:24,939
for example if I'm an administrator I

283
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,110
can create the simple scenario using

284
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:31,480
MQTT if my smart bulb I'm using my smart

285
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:34,570
pressure and if my pressure is too low

286
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:37,300
please turn off the light so it's a

287
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:39,640
example of this scenario in using the

288
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,280
MQTT syntax you can find a lot of

289
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,170
interesting stuff like spiral matters

290
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,650
Spira meters parameters

291
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:49,959
blood pressures and you will find even

292
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,630
something interesting in morgue this is

293
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:55,060
a real case that we found using the show

294
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,590
done in Ireland I don't know for what I

295
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:59,949
don't know what is that probably the

296
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:01,870
honeypot I hope is a honeypot but it's

297
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,090
still available online without any

298
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,880
identification because in key T sub

299
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:11,410
doesn't support any notification of the

300
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,800
ization or there are a lot of depth

301
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,170
portals web applications with no B the

302
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,880
strange things with this kind of

303
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:20,380
vulnerability where is the vulnerability

304
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,480
guess you don't need to be the web

305
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:28,950
application security expert to identify

306
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,950
that it's vulnerable any ideas come on

307
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:38,020
where is the username and password you

308
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:40,510
just press like in button and you will

309
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:43,180
see the internal side of medical portals

310
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,010
that the doctors used to proceed that

311
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,680
the agonistic interpret into press

312
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,450
provide the report for the patient and

313
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,969
there are lots of sensitive data like

314
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:54,610
DICOM image of the body parameters of

315
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,830
the patient a lot of personal medical

316
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,700
data of the patient and of course if you

317
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:03,220
cybercrime you can spoof this stuff you

318
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,500
can steal of course you can delete it

319
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,990
you can encrypt it and just to pay the

320
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:10,990
ransom waiting for the ransom payment

321
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:13,900
etc so this is a real scenario this is a

322
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:17,050
real data and this is available online

323
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,600
without any identification so but it's

324
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,520
just entry point it's just the threat

325
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,650
landscape where is the open the doors in

326
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,939
medical networks but what already

327
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:30,850
happens there and if you are attacker if

328
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:33,310
you're a cybercrime you try to decide

329
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:36,250
extract as much revenue as possible from

330
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:38,949
your victim and when you try to get in

331
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:41,230
in the medical organization you of

332
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:42,990
course tried to exfiltrate the sensitive

333
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,899
data and then

334
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,589
you just try to encrypt the medical data

335
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:53,550
for the ransom Wayne ransomware payment

336
00:15:49,589 --> 00:15:54,990
and this is a statistics that was

337
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,310
extracted with my colleagues in

338
00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,230
Kaspersky Lab that demonstrates a lot of

339
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:04,140
medical organizations attacked by ransom

340
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,140
ransomware and I think this is trivial

341
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:09,300
statistic not only actual for for the

342
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,140
medical organizations was only of course

343
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,390
for any kind of an any level of business

344
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:18,240
or this kind of statistics what kind of

345
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:20,850
malware is an active mode and medical

346
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,260
infrastructure and there are lot of hack

347
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:27,510
tools for the penetration testers and it

348
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:30,720
means two points probably one point that

349
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:33,630
medical organization spend the budgets

350
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,670
for cybersecurity they hire the experts

351
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:40,050
or security consultants to mates to

352
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:44,370
provide some security assessment Rehberg

353
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:46,410
or the second point that somebody tried

354
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,230
to craft and to build his own malware

355
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:51,990
using this tool and try to infect the

356
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,900
victims the medical organizations and I

357
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:58,500
think the second point is more actual

358
00:16:53,900 --> 00:17:00,380
that's why we have detect a lot of open

359
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,679
it stuff like metal predators a lot of

360
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:08,130
payloads that existed online and the sad

361
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,929
statistics told us that mostly all of

362
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:11,610
them all of medical organizations was

363
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:13,800
attacked by three Velma we're like

364
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:16,530
banking Trojans natural predators

365
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,760
etcetera etc and if we try to decompose

366
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:22,260
this statistic for the mmm mapping the

367
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,709
statistic to the two to two the map to

368
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,740
the countries we will see that the

369
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:33,059
Philippines Venezuela etc the countries

370
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:35,910
is most popular for attacking for the

371
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:39,660
attacking of medical organization and if

372
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:42,840
you ask me why I've just used the Google

373
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:49,840
for that and I see that Philippines in

374
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:51,699
Venezuela they have the low budget

375
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,168
for cybersecurity I don't know how to

376
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,120
cook out the statistic correlate with

377
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,669
the real world but world but it's

378
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,500
depends on how many budgets they spend

379
00:17:57,669 --> 00:18:01,090
for public sector in cybersecurity in

380
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,799
public sector and of course in

381
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:06,100
Philippines probably this statistic is

382
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,020
not actual for nowadays but anyway it's

383
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,209
correlate using the budget for cyber

384
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,679
security but we are talking about

385
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,240
medical organization with the

386
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,539
pharmaceutical organizations different

387
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,309
picture because the pharmaceutical it

388
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:19,809
doesn't mean medical from a surgical

389
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,539
organization would be the intellectual

390
00:18:19,809 --> 00:18:24,940
property with the pills with development

391
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,158
of a lot of intellectual stuff that's

392
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,340
why they're in the main priority for the

393
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:32,980
attackers more than medical and this

394
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:37,918
kind of statistics correlate with GDP of

395
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:42,490
the country if GDP depends on medicine

396
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,309
Bangladesh Morocco I think more than 15

397
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:48,190
percent of GDP related to the expert of

398
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:50,230
pills and drugs so that's why it's

399
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:54,100
interesting country interesting objects

400
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,600
for cybercrime and if you ask me have

401
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,219
you find something interesting

402
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,649
not like metal predators not like

403
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,130
classic stuff like Trojans something

404
00:18:59,649 --> 00:19:07,178
targeted that in active mode in musical

405
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:11,010
organization the answer is yes during

406
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:14,950
this quick research we found that some

407
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:17,919
Chinese speaking actors who develop the

408
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:22,419
malware plugins plugs you can find the

409
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,799
records they also infected the

410
00:19:22,419 --> 00:19:28,299
organization in Vietnam and Bangladesh

411
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:30,970
using using the trivial vulnerabilities

412
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:32,799
in web servers on the perimeter they

413
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,470
infected the internal resources and

414
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,389
they're looking for for something

415
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,289
interesting for them business plans of

416
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:42,940
pharmaceutical organization formulas

417
00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:46,289
intellectual properties a lot of

418
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,870
interesting stuff in in context of

419
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:52,720
doping scandals etc I think this

420
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:54,219
attention of attackers to the

421
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,750
pharmaceutical organization will be

422
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:01,720
increased in the main conclusion for

423
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:04,110
this kind of research is just some kind

424
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,389
of advice for the guys for

425
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:09,580
oops we're administrators who works in

426
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:11,949
the mythical infamous Utica facilities

427
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:14,199
it's what we have to do with this kind

428
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,179
of vulnerabilities and there are lots of

429
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,460
interesting advices and a lot of trivial

430
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:20,889
advices that we can provide for these

431
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,139
guys together like please isolate your

432
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:27,370
sensitive stuff sensitive device like

433
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:29,320
MRI CTS or stuff with a sensitive data

434
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:32,110
with intellectual property with

435
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,980
electronic medical records isolated from

436
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:36,129
the Internet

437
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,889
isolated from the perimeter of course or

438
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:41,200
use the encryption encrypt your

439
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:44,260
sensitive business information before

440
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,330
you will be encrypted by ransomware etc

441
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,240
so this is trivial recommendations but

442
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:53,158
who care and I think the main stage for

443
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:57,399
any kind of organization it's just to

444
00:20:53,159 --> 00:21:00,519
identify the attack surface for for your

445
00:20:57,399 --> 00:21:02,590
perimeter for your organization that's

446
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:04,539
why we have developed mean my colleagues

447
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,699
developed the simple tools toolset for

448
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:08,860
the guys who involved in system

449
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:13,870
administrative activities of medical

450
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:16,600
organizations to identify the perimeter

451
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:19,360
and identify the attack surface related

452
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,189
to the perimeter is a simple tool but we

453
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,699
are almost ready to launch the tool so

454
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:27,159
just for example how you can be involved

455
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,389
just send me in the mail who are you and

456
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,710
we will provide the access to the tool

457
00:21:28,389 --> 00:21:32,260
that you can share the tool with your

458
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:35,919
colleagues and medical facilities it's

459
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:39,250
the open it is open it initiative use

460
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,429
the are invite code of our conference to

461
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:45,519
to make some registration stuff and but

462
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,950
anyway what will happen in the future I

463
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:51,639
think they're connected and smart

464
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:54,549
medicine will transform from this stuff

465
00:21:51,639 --> 00:21:58,870
with MRI in the cities available

466
00:21:54,549 --> 00:22:02,769
internet to the human SCADA systems when

467
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:05,320
your body consists of a lot of sensors a

468
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:08,950
lot of implants that communicates

469
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:11,010
directly with the infrastructure of the

470
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:15,159
vendor or with a medical organization

471
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:17,470
that's you can based on big data in

472
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:21,159
national analysis

473
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:22,990
this kind of clouds will provide for you

474
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,820
the actual settings for this in real

475
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:27,129
time sittings for the sensors and for

476
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,928
the implants and I think the piece the

477
00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:31,389
small piece of the future all relate

478
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:33,879
already here because this is a typical

479
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:38,199
infrastructure for the implant patients

480
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:40,959
right now so this is the freemen layers

481
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,809
when the patient with the implants the

482
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,419
clinics who implemented these implants

483
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,908
and use the program Ellis or programmers

484
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:50,320
or controllers to make some settings

485
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:53,320
using the radio frequency for this

486
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,509
implants and the infrastructure for data

487
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:58,529
collection like classical medical

488
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:01,990
portals electronic medical records

489
00:22:58,529 --> 00:23:06,159
medical viewers Deacon viewers and back

490
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:08,879
viewers etc so this infrastructure of

491
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:12,000
future infrastructure of human SCADA

492
00:23:08,879 --> 00:23:16,959
will be founded based on current

493
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,389
solutions and already we have the

494
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,549
electronic medical portals the huge

495
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:23,350
products that allows you to manage

496
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:25,840
electronic medical records of the

497
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,610
patient manage your your activity if you

498
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,389
are a doctor you can plan your skiddo

499
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:34,330
you can incur correct the portion of

500
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:36,008
pills of drugs for the patients etc and

501
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:37,570
you will see the statistics up in

502
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:39,429
statistic of the market of electronic

503
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:41,678
medical portals that it will be

504
00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:45,789
increased and most of them will be the

505
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:49,320
based portals and if you try to use the

506
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:52,779
shorten you already can identify some

507
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,668
electronic medical portals before again

508
00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:56,379
with the username and password but still

509
00:23:54,669 --> 00:23:59,620
available for everyone because doctor

510
00:23:56,379 --> 00:24:01,178
anymore you don't not it's not necessary

511
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,899
to work to work at the office you can

512
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:06,639
work from home and just proceed some

513
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:08,320
some pictures medical pictures proceed

514
00:24:06,639 --> 00:24:11,649
there so that's why it's quite useful

515
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:15,250
for a medical organization but the open

516
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:18,668
source is the key success for medical

517
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,200
organization right now because medical

518
00:24:18,669 --> 00:24:22,289
facilities and from a suitable

519
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,850
facilities they have no budget for

520
00:24:22,289 --> 00:24:27,789
in-house developers or for in-house

521
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,070
system administrators that's why most of

522
00:24:27,789 --> 00:24:32,169
them choose the open source solution and

523
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,658
if you try to

524
00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,669
identify some market open source market

525
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:40,299
for medical portals you will see that

526
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:42,850
there are two big products it's not only

527
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:47,110
there but there are a lot of interesting

528
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:49,240
stuff but most of them are popular like

529
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,850
open EMR electronic medical records or

530
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,399
open a medical record system something

531
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,139
like that they're open sourced they have

532
00:24:54,399 --> 00:24:58,629
a lot of support from the community and

533
00:24:56,139 --> 00:25:00,908
they have a lot of certificates and for

534
00:24:58,629 --> 00:25:04,330
example if you try to look at the open

535
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:07,840
he more installations using using the

536
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:11,320
Chardon you will see that they're

537
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:15,129
installed around the world so for the

538
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:20,200
attacker is the teeth bit because if you

539
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:23,649
find some critical like vulnerability in

540
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,490
the poor medical portal like it RCE or

541
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:29,229
SQL injection whatever else you can get

542
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:32,980
access to the lot of medical information

543
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,480
and I've just started two before the

544
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,940
conference I've just started to look

545
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,730
what happens with the trivial stuff and

546
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:42,610
I was needed like 10 minutes to identify

547
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:45,309
that there are no any sanitization of

548
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:48,789
user input so it's just an example with

549
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:51,120
open EMR if your attacker you can insert

550
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:53,200
that bit story called and the page and

551
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,080
it's a classic cross side scripting

552
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,659
scenario or this night

553
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,110
I've looked an open MRI an arrest system

554
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:05,460
and the same nothing is filtered nothing

555
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,799
is not sanitized and if your attacker

556
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,419
you of course can steal something but

557
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,309
cross-site scripting is a little bit

558
00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:13,960
difficult for exploitation you need to

559
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,090
use the social engineering attack but

560
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:19,539
it's still possible it means that this

561
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:21,639
organization don't have any security a

562
00:26:19,539 --> 00:26:24,820
life cycle during the development

563
00:26:21,639 --> 00:26:29,439
process and this is another example of

564
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:31,750
non Wilner ability that leads to remote

565
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,309
code execution on the server so here

566
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:38,590
attacker you don't just need to craft

567
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:40,840
the XML based payload with some kind of

568
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:44,019
commons for example this common sense to

569
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:45,049
launch the calculator you send the

570
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:49,129
request in call

571
00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:50,918
later is launched that's it so LCE using

572
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:53,480
their vulnerability with the insecure

573
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,190
deserialization you can find more

574
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,690
information about these wounds using the

575
00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:03,200
CV eat it means not only that it doesn't

576
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:05,779
mean that means that developers or guys

577
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,309
who involved in developing of this

578
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,809
open-source products they are the Lowe

579
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:12,619
has a low qualification no they're

580
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:15,139
experienced guys but I think there have

581
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:18,168
no process process of secure development

582
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:21,399
that allows you to proceed assessments

583
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:24,919
for each stage of the development you

584
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,600
need to create the assessment for for

585
00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:28,249
your code you need to create assessment

586
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,859
for your binaries you need to black box

587
00:27:28,249 --> 00:27:35,659
white box if you create the products for

588
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:39,279
this kind of purposes you have to create

589
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:42,080
a HDL for them and I think together as

590
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:44,119
an expert we have to involve that much

591
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,939
as much as possible involved a lot of

592
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:48,799
people whose developer who is with

593
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,779
involved to deploy or for DevOps

594
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,929
operations in mythical organizations and

595
00:27:50,779 --> 00:27:57,379
to share with them our experience how we

596
00:27:53,929 --> 00:28:01,489
can mitigate the threat before the

597
00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:04,879
product will be on the market and like a

598
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:06,649
conclusion we have a lot of interesting

599
00:28:04,879 --> 00:28:09,199
technologies around the world right now

600
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:11,719
that based on machine learning threat

601
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:15,559
intelligence artificial intelligence a

602
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,379
lot of buzzwords there but it can't be

603
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,678
effective if people click on the fission

604
00:28:18,379 --> 00:28:25,779
link right because the social

605
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,779
engineering attack still exists

606
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,969
[Applause]

607
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,170
[Music]

608
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,990
[Music]

609
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,710
[Applause]

610
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,559
[Music]

611
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,409
and I really love the video because it's

612
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:14,059
a beautiful illustration of exploitation

613
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:17,549
of the vulnerability in our DNA and

614
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:20,759
nowadays it's only one patch for this

615
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:31,379
vulnerability this is education that's

616
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:36,899
why we are here right thank you if you

617
00:29:31,379 --> 00:29:39,570
have a question feel free to ask ok so

618
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:44,219
we have 25 minutes so we have a lot of

619
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:55,549
time to questions so don't waste it I'm

620
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:55,549
going to run so to be faster hello

621
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,759
medical records that you were able to

622
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,200
find

623
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:05,190
I think that there is a lot of

624
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,519
Revelation in that so if it is public I

625
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:13,559
would say the inter the hospital

626
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:16,129
and even the hardware or developers of

627
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:20,309
the heart they should be fine really

628
00:30:16,129 --> 00:30:22,649
really hardly know there is no feedback

629
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,899
from the hospitals and that is that they

630
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:27,869
so they close the door and then that's

631
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:30,570
all they just like a black hole you send

632
00:30:27,869 --> 00:30:32,369
some requests for them and doesn't hear

633
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,539
because I don't know who is my system

634
00:30:32,369 --> 00:30:36,240
administrator I don't know why it is a

635
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:37,860
deployed out there but I think the the

636
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,840
main contact point for us like for

637
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:41,758
researchers is the developers of the

638
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,070
open EMR system or the system

639
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:46,559
administrators and the regulators

640
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:48,799
currently is not so effective but I

641
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,899
think the situation will be improved

642
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,509
currently I think the United States

643
00:30:50,899 --> 00:30:56,549
organizations like FDA they try to build

644
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:59,009
some security strategy around for the

645
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:01,918
medical organizations but it's like

646
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:05,220
first stage for them so I think

647
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,169
worldwide the situation it's worth so we

648
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,869
have to improve it using using the

649
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:12,029
contact or using the tools that allows

650
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:13,889
them to control the perimeter or to

651
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:15,330
control the attack surface and to

652
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:17,428
educate them so I think it's only

653
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,389
currently it's only three strategies for

654
00:31:17,429 --> 00:31:22,320
us how to improve this

655
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:26,610
tuition educate control and submit some

656
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,230
some findings and public same should not

657
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:33,990
work because in that case if you make

658
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:36,720
public these data related you increase

659
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:37,800
data and you ask for money like you you

660
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,450
don't need to increase the data you get

661
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,129
the data and then you say if you don't

662
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,830
give me much yeah we'll make it public

663
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:46,380
then I got it from you yeah yep it's not

664
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,740
a good case but it works because when it

665
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:52,650
just related to open em er Open MRI not

666
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,660
amirite open em are when I found some

667
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:58,200
critical rules there I've tried to

668
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,120
extract some contacts of the owners of

669
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,700
the organisation and there have no any

670
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,600
public emails on their website they have

671
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:08,070
no any contacts using the Twitter

672
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:11,070
because they have Twitter handle but

673
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:13,050
they still in silent mode I've decided

674
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,429
just to publish information without any

675
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,840
technical details publish information

676
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:19,890
that guys I found some vulnerabilities

677
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,470
they're just an example and after that

678
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:25,410
the guy who was involved in development

679
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,490
process you've seen the tweet and after

680
00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:28,080
that he asked me what kind of

681
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:31,620
vulnerabilities how can I help you sir

682
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,929
sometimes it it helpful but it's not so

683
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:45,870
good when you have to private discussion

684
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:48,240
with them thank you for your

685
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,979
presentation I just saw some numbers on

686
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,140
your previous slides and I want to make

687
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,490
sure I correctly interpret them before

688
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:59,700
relaying them over so it says about in

689
00:32:56,490 --> 00:33:03,390
most countries about 60% of medical

690
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:06,120
devices have been attacked so is it safe

691
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:08,700
to say that more than one Hospital in -

692
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,350
in this country is compromised and data

693
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,390
have leaked in term of attacked on these

694
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:16,949
statistics it means that they have done

695
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,110
in - virus product and then the virus

696
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:21,120
product prevent the attempt of attacking

697
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:24,300
so I think they're not compromised

698
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,669
there was attacked but the attack was

699
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:30,300
prevention a prevention system was

700
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:32,130
catching so I think it's not so so dark

701
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,399
the situation not so dark like you for

702
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,480
now

703
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:39,600
like each hospital is compromised no no

704
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:58,410
it was attacked but currently it's in it

705
00:33:39,600 --> 00:34:02,850
detected yeah anyone else sir I can't

706
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:06,120
see you who are you at the beginning you

707
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:08,909
asked if we believe that cyber attacks

708
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:11,880
are killing more people than cancer and

709
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,870
then after a few minutes you are talking

710
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:17,850
about medical errors so do you know of

711
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:20,779
any cyber attacks that actually killed

712
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:24,270
people yeah I know I've read the news

713
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:26,970
like my months ago and I don't believe

714
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:30,800
the OL news that I'm reading but there

715
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:33,870
was this scenario when the girlfriend

716
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,820
used the Bluetooth connection to

717
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:40,859
compromise the insulin pump of her

718
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:44,100
boyfriend to compromise him and try to

719
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,960
kill him and now she's in jail as far as

720
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:49,668
I know so the attempts there are a lot

721
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:52,740
of attempts but not sure that we have

722
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:55,440
cases with the death but I hope we will

723
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,299
not have this cases okay so the main

724
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,510
problem in the hospitals and in the

725
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,960
medical area are still confidentiality

726
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:06,810
and availability so not really the

727
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,130
integrity of the data because the

728
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:13,740
medical yet the pharmaceutical data is

729
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,720
very important for the hospitals because

730
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:17,759
you cannot interfere with them or

731
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,709
manipulate them because you have a lot

732
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,350
of patients who are really on the edge

733
00:35:19,710 --> 00:35:29,970
between life and death so but if I

734
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:33,960
understand you correctly this is not the

735
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:36,839
biggest issue it's not the biggest issue

736
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,270
biggest issue is that we have no

737
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,000
awareness about that not awareness about

738
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:44,190
this case and this is a biggest issue

739
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,170
but the availability availability of the

740
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:48,630
data online I think

741
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:50,490
still issue that is actual right now at

742
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,380
this moment it's not the kind of huger

743
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:54,660
pictures is not like a kind of future

744
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,150
systems that we have to protect it's

745
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:59,578
already available for everyone and it's

746
00:35:57,150 --> 00:36:00,930
already you can use tools without any

747
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,290
qualification you can extract this data

748
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:18,259
is the issue but it's not the biggest

749
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:21,630
okay thank you hey thanks for the talk

750
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:23,640
about your statistics various things

751
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:26,780
surprising about Japan

752
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,520
it was the only country high-level

753
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:33,270
revenue um

754
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,670
contouring some high level of attack

755
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:40,770
only in a hospital do you have any clue

756
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:44,760
about any clue about what do you wanting

757
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:47,190
from me what what do you mean clue

758
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:52,470
you know just explanation about why

759
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:54,809
Japan of like over the explanation no

760
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:56,730
idea because it's just statistics that

761
00:36:54,809 --> 00:36:59,040
I've tried to make some interpretation

762
00:36:56,730 --> 00:37:01,109
for that and then this interpreted kind

763
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,020
of interpretation not so strong probably

764
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:06,720
a GDP etc it's high level high level

765
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,849
clues probably for you but technically I

766
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:14,069
think the one clue that you have more

767
00:37:10,849 --> 00:37:17,010
medical facility or more mythical stuff

768
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:19,349
inside the country and that's why you

769
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:21,210
are in statistic but as far as I know

770
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:22,950
you're not in top of the statistic

771
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,900
that's why I think it's difficult to

772
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:26,009
make some interpretation for that there

773
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,589
are a lot of countries that we have

774
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:30,540
known any explanations why there are

775
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:33,180
peers there where is the Russia for

776
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,490
example where's the United States so

777
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,770
with a huge implementation of medical

778
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:39,180
technologies so this kind of that is the

779
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:42,089
interpretation of the statistic I think

780
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,029
based on your your ideas I need the more

781
00:37:42,089 --> 00:37:50,150
ideas from your side why you're from

782
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:50,150
Japan no no okay

783
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:05,100
okay we still have time so if you have

784
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:06,780
the question so we will have the

785
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:14,160
equation after that feel free to ask me

786
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:17,010
I'm open it for a discussion if we have

787
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,140
time follow up something actually

788
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:23,130
question it's a response to the medical

789
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:26,460
death happening due to medical problems

790
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,560
on cyber problems the Swiss Office for

791
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,930
Civil Protection run several scenarios

792
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,770
on cyber attacks in Switzerland and

793
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:37,790
they're all published at Google Website

794
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:41,100
Swiss Office for Civil Protection

795
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:43,890
scenarios and there they play the game

796
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:45,810
where the hypothetical Swiss cloud

797
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,660
providers Swiss cloud would crash

798
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,759
completely for several days and a

799
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:53,730
mid-sized Swiss hospital lost its

800
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,800
patients data like completely and they

801
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:59,070
would expect a handful of death in the

802
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,640
emergency room due to that so des

803
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:06,270
considered is a viable scenario like any

804
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,759
time Swiss cloud could crash yeah it's

805
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:11,310
another kind of scenarios for that for

806
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:24,690
the blockbusters too and for video games

807
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:27,599
but it still happens this as I said okay

808
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,000
so thank you Danny and thank you elbow

809
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,560
afterwards she wants

810
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,730
[Applause]
