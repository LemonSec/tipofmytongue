2
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,779
thank you for coming here thank you for

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,939
your time and hopefully this will be a

4
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:25,000
valuable session I will talk about some

5
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:29,540
threats in the cloud that we have

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,829
detected as a company not only actually

7
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:36,829
what we do but basically how crooks how

8
00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:39,670
criminals have learned to exploit the

9
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:43,129
cloud for their malicious operations for

10
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:46,910
multiple purposes that can range from a

11
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:50,149
tan or creeper jacking or simply in new

12
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:55,069
ways to evade the traditional security

13
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:57,530
solutions and so on I would say that

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:59,809
today's pretty easy to find some

15
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,940
examples every day I mean I just did a

16
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:05,570
test that yesterday I went on Google

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:10,759
just to type some breach simply breach

18
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:14,630
in the cloud and basically the most the

19
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:18,439
latest one quite big happened no later

20
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:20,899
than nine days ago but every day there's

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:23,419
something new there are operations

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,790
carried out through the cloud there are

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:28,640
high profile victims you probably

24
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:31,880
remember that one of the companies which

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,829
is the the symbol of this digital

26
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,619
transformation process which is Tesla

27
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:39,679
was compromised more or less one year

28
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,540
ago unfortunately that case consequences

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,170
were not so serious but that's an

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,619
example of the implications that may

31
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:53,570
occur when for instance cloud services

32
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:56,780
are misconfigured and so on which are

33
00:01:53,570 --> 00:02:00,258
the attacks that can be carried out

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:04,009
through cloud resources we have for

35
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:07,280
example mobile malware infection through

36
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:10,490
cloud we will see a slide after but we

37
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,840
have called this phenomenon the cloud

38
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:17,750
fan-out effect basically what happens is

39
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,630
that the synchronization of documents in

40
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:24,260
the cloud may

41
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:29,900
may command the possibility of the

42
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:32,690
malware to spread to propagate we a

43
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,420
cloud resources can be used for storing

44
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:38,150
the malicious payload or storing the

45
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:42,739
command and control there's a very

46
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:45,620
simple logic behind this that tends to

47
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,200
evade the physical firewalls

48
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:51,350
the physical security to the security

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,730
technologies but in the same time then

50
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:59,320
to evade the human firewall because if I

51
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:02,480
see a connection that is going to a

52
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,600
service that for me it's benign that I

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,269
recognize like a Google Drive or can be

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,460
whatever as we will see soon obviously I

55
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:15,070
feel more comfortable that I'm not a

56
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:18,110
victim always of a threat and of course

57
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:21,410
the next point using the cloud to hide

58
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:26,780
phishing is similar we'll see some

59
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:31,120
examples of real-world events that we

60
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:34,250
detect at head headed to the news of

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:37,940
course application vulnerabilities can

62
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:41,150
be exploited to run attacks or maybe

63
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:44,210
even not only to run attacks if you

64
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,880
believe that many services like the DNS

65
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,340
for examples can be managed directly

66
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,799
from a cloud service from a from an iOS

67
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:55,280
platform you can understand even in this

68
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,950
case the consequences brute-forcing weak

69
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,650
passwords and you know this is becoming

70
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:05,060
quite dramatic because you are probably

71
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:08,990
aware of the dumps that come out on a

72
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,690
really weekly basis the latest one was

73
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,720
probably less than 10 days ago

74
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:19,600
additional 92 million accounts and

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:23,000
obviously I can simply do credential

76
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,400
stuffing attacks or just try to enter

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,500
maybe I leverage I hope that people are

78
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,229
not security savvy they don't change

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,520
their passwords and I can try to start

80
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:38,090
to scan public-facing services

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,099
and unfortunately the material there is

82
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:46,299
even too much material with all these

83
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:49,250
breaches and obviously the last one is

84
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,440
related directly hunting for publicly

85
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:57,169
accessible wizard yeah I use resources

86
00:04:51,440 --> 00:05:01,370
like s3 buckets again just go on your

87
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:03,620
favorite search engine and type s3

88
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,370
bucket sleek and you can see you will

89
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,039
spoil for the choice because there's

90
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:13,009
there have been there are multiple

91
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:22,068
examples on a really really daily basis

92
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:25,099
so as I said before cloud services are

93
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:27,199
increasingly hosted to increasingly use

94
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:32,750
to host the command and controls and to

95
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:37,039
distribute malware we call this this new

96
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:42,099
trend hybrid threats because basically

97
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:46,310
they use they use a traditional

98
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:49,849
infection vectors like the web or like a

99
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,630
phishing email but a certain point of

100
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:55,370
the attack stage they decide to put some

101
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,099
elements in the cloud

102
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:02,270
basically the distribution of the

103
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:04,669
payload for example or also the command

104
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:07,909
and control and we will see later the

105
00:06:04,669 --> 00:06:12,620
reason why this is done so malware

106
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:15,289
infects the device via the the via and

107
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:18,620
in traditional in initial vector like a

108
00:06:15,289 --> 00:06:21,229
drive-by campaign a phishing email when

109
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,990
the malware is downloaded it calls value

110
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:26,000
services like websites cloud storage etc

111
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:28,180
and then basically can use the cloud

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,719
storage also to exfiltrate the

113
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:38,830
information so basically you know the

114
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:42,440
key chain so recognition weaponization

115
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:46,310
delivery of the payload exploit it and

116
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:48,110
also callback and persist you know

117
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,150
probably that basically the

118
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,760
Chane may vary the times of the keychain

119
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,039
and the phases of the keychain may vary

120
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,260
depending if the attack is opportunistic

121
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,710
or targeted but it's it's interesting

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,650
actually because we have noticed it

123
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:08,719
Natalya's of course there are multiple

124
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:12,169
examples of attacks carried out using

125
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:16,030
the keychain modified to cope with the

126
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:19,430
cloud both opportunistic in nature and

127
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:22,270
targeted I remember at least two

128
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,550
examples very recent examples of

129
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:29,650
targeted attacks leveraging exploiting

130
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:32,230
the cloud by an apt called dark hydrous

131
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:37,659
targeting primarily the middle east and

132
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:41,780
another IPT called the Cabal to strike

133
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:44,390
gang the guys behind also the carbonic

134
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,960
malware you are probably aware of the

135
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:51,080
carbonic malware so targeting primarily

136
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,680
financial organizations and the cloud

137
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,409
can be used on you know basically the

138
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,350
recognition is normally done when the

139
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:02,090
attack is targeted because I need to I

140
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:04,490
need to collect information about my

141
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:07,310
victims normally the most used channel

142
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:09,530
is social engineering because

143
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:13,070
unfortunately today you can go on a

144
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:16,580
social network and you can see every

145
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:19,070
single detail of the life of a person

146
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,500
and unfortunately the line between

147
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,810
personal and professional life even on

148
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,170
personal social net social networks is

149
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:30,980
very blurred but also even the cloud can

150
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:33,590
be recognized because I have multiple

151
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,680
ways to recognize if a specific

152
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:40,070
application is if a specific target is

153
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:42,439
using a cloud service because I can try

154
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:46,910
to guess the domains and see if these

155
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:52,150
domains exist and then try to use stolen

156
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:55,839
credentials to see if I can enter then

157
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:59,689
the delivery obviously traditional

158
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,730
traditionally has always been using the

159
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:04,429
web or also the

160
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:11,089
but today as we will see can also use

161
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:14,689
the cloud the exploit again can use the

162
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,059
cloud because actually yeah the exploit

163
00:09:14,689 --> 00:09:22,429
happens in the endpoint but there might

164
00:09:17,059 --> 00:09:25,249
be multiple stages where multiple yes

165
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:28,790
stages of the payload are downloaded and

166
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:32,739
obviously then the cold back and vs the

167
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,959
cold back phase obviously the

168
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:38,989
persistence phase happens only if the

169
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:40,669
attack is targeted normally because the

170
00:09:38,989 --> 00:09:42,709
attackers want to establish the

171
00:09:40,669 --> 00:09:45,619
footprint inside the organization and

172
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:49,779
then use this footprint to do their

173
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:52,790
nasty things there has been a very

174
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:56,419
remarkable example recently just a

175
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,248
couple of weeks ago of a company in our

176
00:09:56,419 --> 00:10:02,209
sector that was victim of similar

177
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:05,749
attacks but anyway the callback even in

178
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:08,238
this case can go to a command and

179
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:13,480
control infrastructure hosted on a cloud

180
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:18,199
service why is the cloud used for these

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:21,919
for these phases of the kill chain for

182
00:10:18,199 --> 00:10:24,429
multiple reasons first if I decide to go

183
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:28,639
in an infrastructure like for example

184
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:32,329
AWS it's everywhere I don't need to

185
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,519
explicitly register a domain so I expose

186
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:38,979
an element of the attack chain that can

187
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:41,929
be detected or blacklisted most of all

188
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:45,019
every organization now directly or

189
00:10:41,929 --> 00:10:47,299
indirectly is using AWS and so basically

190
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,359
these domains will never be blacklisted

191
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:53,329
and in the same time on Prem

192
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:56,299
technologies don't do the creeps on on a

193
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:58,339
large scale obviously because it affects

194
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:00,919
performances it affects the user

195
00:10:58,339 --> 00:11:03,350
experience and so on so basically it's

196
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,959
very likely that if a certain

197
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:08,720
organization is using Google is using

198
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,699
Google is using AWS is using Google

199
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,980
cloud platform there will be very luxe

200
00:11:10,699 --> 00:11:15,370
security controls on the traffic going

201
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:19,990
to these cloud services

202
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:23,779
so if he's a callback will be detected

203
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:26,089
one be blacklisted most of all and if

204
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:28,639
it's a payload distribution obviously

205
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:31,490
that connection won't be scanned because

206
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,550
normally traditional firewalls or

207
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,160
proxies don't scan these domains because

208
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,099
don't have resources for SSL decryption

209
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,160
on a large scale because they introduce

210
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,269
latency and so on

211
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,680
unfortunately the criminals have learned

212
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:55,730
ever quickly understood this reality and

213
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:59,930
obviously are adapting to that okay once

214
00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:03,680
that will we have just said we have just

215
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:06,739
described how the threat the keychain as

216
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:09,760
a bolt or basically how the cloud can

217
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:12,889
play some roles inside the kill chain

218
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,990
let's see some examples I've told you

219
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:17,389
before the risks connected to the

220
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,459
adoption of the the threats connected to

221
00:12:17,389 --> 00:12:23,209
the adoption of the cloud but for

222
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:26,750
example this was this was an research

223
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:31,300
that my company did basically back in

224
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:33,560
September 2 to 2016 we discovered a

225
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,790
malware called the veer looks

226
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:41,119
via lock virus locker that was

227
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:46,069
characterized by having basically two

228
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,380
functions on the heat file the file was

229
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,300
encrypted obviously and in the same time

230
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:55,339
was turned into an effector these what

231
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:58,459
have we discovered this threat because

232
00:12:55,339 --> 00:13:01,640
basically the file infected a cloud

233
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:06,768
application a cloud storage and so all

234
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:10,010
the files became infection vectors and

235
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:12,560
obviously they were they were

236
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:15,110
synchronized inside a company and

237
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,329
obviously the malware was able to

238
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,000
propagate much more quickly we believed

239
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:22,849
that this was only a theoretical effort

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,300
effect we call these the fan-out effect

241
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:28,220
but in the same time a couple of not a

242
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,030
couple of years one year and a half

243
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:32,060
after

244
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:35,540
there was another ransomware using a

245
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:39,739
similar mechanism called Q key G that

246
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:44,900
was using basically he was propagating

247
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:48,890
himself through basically the document

248
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:52,579
template so he infected the files

249
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:54,590
infecting the template and so all the

250
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,320
documents written with the same template

251
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:59,660
were infected as well and obviously

252
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,900
imagine what happens if I'm using office

253
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,630
365 if my organization is using office

254
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,490
365 for example and the documents will

255
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:09,080
be putted at the disposal of all the

256
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:11,330
members of the organization and

257
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:13,460
synchronized but this is the first

258
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,260
example we discovered hidden back in

259
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,810
2016 we believe it was only a

260
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:20,420
theoretical effect but there are also

261
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:25,729
some examples in the wild using similar

262
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:30,290
techniques to propagate just for just

263
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,600
for the records this is the every moral

264
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,699
acts more or less six months my company

265
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,230
publishes a report of the malware that

266
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,210
we see and basically except in the cloud

267
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:44,000
obviously in the cloud this is the

268
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,250
telemetry that we collect from the

269
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,230
customer based in the cloud and normally

270
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,900
we see that back doors and Microsoft

271
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,240
Office macros ranked at number one I'm

272
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:55,280
curious to see what will be the outcome

273
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,770
in the next report this one was the

274
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:59,720
latest because we do one every six

275
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:02,240
months this was more or less one year

276
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:04,790
ago the lat the latest one in October

277
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,100
was dedicated to the is security but I

278
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:10,699
think it's nearly time for the 2019

279
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:15,680
report so I'm curious to see what will

280
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:19,820
be the D outcomes so this is just to

281
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:22,189
tell you that basically these are the

282
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,190
cloud services are used in the keychain

283
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:27,560
because they are able to bypass

284
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:31,250
traditional security measures is like a

285
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,969
lamb mole that is able to pass a fire if

286
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,680
the parking bar okay unfortunately I

287
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:39,830
didn't find a picture within a real

288
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:42,649
Italian car I know Lambo is Italian but

289
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:45,350
just the name given that it belongs

290
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:48,379
to the Vig group but anyway this was a

291
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:55,119
very good example to to show you

292
00:15:48,379 --> 00:16:00,230
basically how it is possible to evade a

293
00:15:55,119 --> 00:16:03,019
security the traditional security let's

294
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:06,819
see some examples actually these are

295
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:11,689
examples that we spotted in the wild

296
00:16:06,819 --> 00:16:14,769
actually many of them I was unsure if

297
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:18,290
showing these slides because actually

298
00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:20,990
you're not going hive you you know what

299
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,559
coin hive is right it's a library to

300
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:26,809
mine it's a library to mine on arrow

301
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,059
many of these examples actually actually

302
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:33,350
were using coin I've that has been shut

303
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:37,309
down two weeks ago because now the price

304
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:39,949
of the creep the coins is so volatile

305
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:42,050
that actually they said I know we don't

306
00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:46,368
think that our project is convenient any

307
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:50,319
longer anyway the examples that we

308
00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:53,929
spotted were primarily related to minors

309
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:58,248
that are currently probably the main

310
00:16:53,929 --> 00:17:00,230
threats in this twenty in the in 2018 in

311
00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:03,949
the second part of 2018 and this

312
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:08,409
beginning of 2019 in any case this is

313
00:17:03,949 --> 00:17:11,270
the typical example of a hybrid threat

314
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:14,569
because basically in this case the

315
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:16,849
initial payload was delivered via we

316
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:22,510
discovered two different variants of the

317
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:29,320
same campaign basically using a drive-by

318
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:31,760
okay or a paper install or executable

319
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:36,230
but basically the purpose of the

320
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:40,520
executable was just to install the

321
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:46,100
dropper and basically download the miner

322
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:47,000
from AWS and also once the machine was

323
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,658
compromised

324
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:56,570
the details were escalated to an added

325
00:17:50,659 --> 00:18:04,159
another AWS instance this is exactly the

326
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:06,860
the the the application of the of the of

327
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,620
the attack modus operandi that I

328
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:12,590
explained before

329
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:15,399
AWS normally is open also because when I

330
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,840
visit a website or when I visit an

331
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:21,049
application that has nothing to deal in

332
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,259
theory with AWS this application can go

333
00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:27,740
to take to fetch some content from 8 WS

334
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:29,480
where I will be redirected and so if I

335
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,799
have a firewall and next-generation

336
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:36,950
firewall if I have a next-generation

337
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:40,120
technology these technology will see

338
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:43,789
that there is a connection to AWS but

339
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:47,178
won't be able to recognize the context

340
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:50,809
of the connection if I'm going to the

341
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:54,529
specific instance of AWS belonging to my

342
00:18:50,809 --> 00:18:58,070
organization or if I'm going to an

343
00:18:54,529 --> 00:19:02,360
anonymous AWS instance that is

344
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:05,269
containing malware for example or simply

345
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:11,059
to an anonymous instance of AWS where

346
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:13,039
I'm exfiltrating data ok and the

347
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,158
criminals unfortunately I've learned

348
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:21,250
this much faster than many security

349
00:19:16,159 --> 00:19:24,860
companies and use waste like this to

350
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:26,419
drop the malicious payload and s potrait

351
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:31,449
the content and in this particular

352
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,450
campaign the criminals were able to earn

353
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:39,470
100,000 bucks in illicit mining in the

354
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:43,909
space of two weeks more or less

355
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:47,780
this was another example Z minor ma but

356
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:50,150
a very similar modus operandi in this

357
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,600
case the initial act attack vector was

358
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:57,050
an exploit it and the executable

359
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,159
downloaded the payloads from the air

360
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:03,860
from an s3 storage and obviously again

361
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:06,590
mining an exfiltration of data to AWS

362
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:09,709
another example of the same keychain

363
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:15,620
that we have seen before but again using

364
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:19,250
the cloud okay this one was very even

365
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:22,729
more interesting because it used a let's

366
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,280
say multiple factors and disease so the

367
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:27,940
the the difference is that the previous

368
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:32,629
two campaigns we have seen where

369
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:37,190
opportunistic this one instead is an

370
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:39,650
example of a targeted campaign by the

371
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,390
cobalt strike gang was discovered quite

372
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:44,470
recently because it was I think it was

373
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:52,730
January this year January February quite

374
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:54,770
recently and basically in these case the

375
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:59,750
the redirection to the malicious side

376
00:20:54,770 --> 00:21:03,200
happened through a redirection on Google

377
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,270
cloud platform application engine you

378
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,920
know that Google cloud platform as this

379
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:12,820
it's a feature they have it's called

380
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:16,880
open redirector okay when I go to a

381
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:21,110
domain in this specific case basically

382
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,690
the attack started with a PDF decoy the

383
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:27,260
user clicked on the PDF file normally

384
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,900
the PDF II viewer show you that okay

385
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,480
this document is connecting to an

386
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,150
external source and this was the case as

387
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,930
well obviously but these external source

388
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:41,090
was Google cloud platform and so the

389
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,360
user thinks okay it's connecting to

390
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:47,060
Google platform is not connecting to

391
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:51,649
blah blah blah they the XY blah blah dot

392
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:52,520
something so it's a trusted document in

393
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,800
this case or

394
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,860
the attackers were evading the human

395
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,490
firewall the human security

396
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:04,729
but then when connecting to that URL it

397
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:08,720
was a logout URL with a region

398
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:13,400
redirection an HTTP 302 redirection to

399
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:16,970
the real malware distribution side so

400
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:20,179
it's a chain of factor obviously but

401
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,700
again the connection is going to Google

402
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:25,429
cloud platform so maybe it's not

403
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:28,820
expected even inspected there's nothing

404
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:35,200
bad on that for the technology but also

405
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:38,600
for the user because as I said before Oh

406
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,490
Google application engine it's the

407
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,230
domain was application engine not

408
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,030
google.com it's a Google domain is

409
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,320
nothing malicious and by the way this is

410
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:50,210
a by design feature unfortunately Google

411
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,870
Google say I don't have any

412
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:57,350
responsibility where the redirection

413
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:59,149
happens we are improving obviously to

414
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,240
make sure that we can check these

415
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:05,720
domains but the open redirection it's a

416
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,059
feature that is part of our suite but

417
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,620
that's an example of how the cloud can

418
00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:19,070
be leveraged to evade human and

419
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:19,729
technological security things can only

420
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:22,790
get better

421
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,610
or not this is another example obviously

422
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:29,870
capital install hosted on and served via

423
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:32,300
is this was another example of a

424
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,209
targeted attack this was dark hydrous

425
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,190
using Google Drive dark hydro Zen a apt

426
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:41,150
targeting entities in the Middle East

427
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:44,000
using Google Drive for let's say it's

428
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:47,270
command and control ok

429
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,720
this was another research that basically

430
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:54,679
Google sheets can spread the CSV malware

431
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,750
is the same it's a similar approach to

432
00:23:54,679 --> 00:23:59,150
the previous one we have seen in this

433
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:02,120
case basically when I download the

434
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:04,970
document from Google Drive and I execute

435
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,500
the document obviously Microsoft will

436
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,630
warn you

437
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:10,790
there's a macro that is doing something

438
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:12,320
but you say oh this document was

439
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:19,520
downloaded from Google

440
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:21,230
so it's okay it's good so you can notice

441
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,510
that there is always a common

442
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:25,730
denominator you know in the utilization

443
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,900
of the cloud services to launch this

444
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:34,780
kind of attack and attacks and is always

445
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:37,460
the the possibility to combine the human

446
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:41,350
insecurities with basically the lack or

447
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:45,760
the human trust with the lack of

448
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:48,709
controls on cloud services that many

449
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,190
reality many entities many organizations

450
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:59,480
have so human factors and technological

451
00:24:52,190 --> 00:25:05,000
factors then okay do you remember this

452
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:12,440
movie no you are too young maybe come on

453
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:15,080
guys yes exactly the Naked Gun you are

454
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:18,590
too young and unfortunately bad you know

455
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:21,080
there was this guy with basically this

456
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,178
factory that was exploding and people

457
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:25,760
screaming everywhere and he was saying

458
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,740
nothing here please disperse and

459
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,900
obviously it's what is happening because

460
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:33,710
basically there's there are multiple

461
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:36,020
ways when where the cloud can be

462
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:39,110
exploited for attacks but unfortunately

463
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:43,490
seems there's not much awareness at the

464
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:47,178
moment despite all the news that we see

465
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:54,380
each day on a daily and weekly weekly

466
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:56,600
basis anyway other way to use the cloud

467
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:58,940
to launch attacks this is slightly

468
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,820
different but there are already multiple

469
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:05,780
examples in this way do the phishing

470
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:08,540
page was hosted on hazier and the reason

471
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:12,678
is very simple because the certificate

472
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:14,899
is signed by Microsoft you know that the

473
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,470
first the certificate of the phishing

474
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,230
page obviously the first

475
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:25,039
level of mistrust is always the human

476
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:27,320
being and when you see in theory you

477
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,179
should be concerned when you see the

478
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,000
browser telling you you know you are

479
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:36,860
going to this domain but I don't

480
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:41,240
recognize this domain or maybe you are

481
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:44,678
going to a domain with a strange name in

482
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:48,620
this case the phishing page was hosted

483
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:51,400
into an azure blob and so the

484
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:56,229
certificate was signed by Microsoft

485
00:26:51,400 --> 00:27:01,640
completely legitimate and also with a

486
00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:06,409
payee with a domain name which sounded

487
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:09,220
kind of familiar for the victims so

488
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:14,059
again I don't need to register any

489
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:16,059
specific domain on the web I can use an

490
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:19,158
infrastructure that provides me with

491
00:27:16,059 --> 00:27:21,980
resiliency of course availability

492
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:23,780
because this is another problem for the

493
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,780
attackers they must make sure that their

494
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:30,500
infrastructures are available resilient

495
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,309
and so on and so it's even better why

496
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:35,450
not

497
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:40,960
storing a malicious page on Google on

498
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:44,990
sorry Asia there have been actually I

499
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,770
okay yes this is this hasn't been the

500
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:51,020
only case actually because there has

501
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:54,710
been also another similar similar

502
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:59,510
campaign similar at least in concept in

503
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:02,870
the wild called the fish point where

504
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:06,908
basically the the fishing campaign was

505
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:10,699
triggered through a SharePoint document

506
00:28:06,909 --> 00:28:12,890
received again in this case the users

507
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:15,770
believe they are using a legitimate

508
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:20,210
cloud application and obviously there's

509
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:22,850
there's the same common denominator we

510
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:26,059
have seen before the company that

511
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:29,530
discovered fish point believes that the

512
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:32,240
ten percent of the office 365

513
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:35,360
organizations customers worldwide

514
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,600
been affected maybe it's too much my

515
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:44,169
humble opinion but it's another

516
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:47,178
interesting evidence of how the

517
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:50,929
traditional attacks like fishing can

518
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:56,960
find the new dimensions thanks to the

519
00:28:50,929 --> 00:29:00,020
cloud okay but in the same time cloud is

520
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,840
not only SAS software as a service cloud

521
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:08,150
is also it's actually increasingly is

522
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:13,040
infrastructure as a service so basically

523
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:15,830
I can have my services like AWS as your

524
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:18,440
Google cloud platform and start to build

525
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:22,639
my applications to ask my services and

526
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:26,240
so on and of course I can leave open

527
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,240
ports on these open doors actually in

528
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,270
these services this is an example

529
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,809
actually it happened to me it's not very

530
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:37,730
recent but I want to use it as well

531
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:41,300
because actually what was quite

532
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:43,429
impressive for me honestly but basically

533
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:45,800
I was playing it happens it was made

534
00:29:43,429 --> 00:29:51,440
last year I believe I was playing with

535
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:54,110
it it was not a honeypot or is it was

536
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,860
not voluntarily in a honeypot I was just

537
00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:01,250
doing some tests I was playing with a

538
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:06,159
Linux server on AWS I get this I think

539
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:10,700
it was a the Python embedded web server

540
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:13,610
flask okay in the bug mode because I was

541
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,070
just writing a simple client-server

542
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:17,899
thing I started to see connections

543
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:22,300
coming from nowhere and these

544
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:29,510
connections came out just after probably

545
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:32,980
yes ten minutes okay now imagine if I

546
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:36,520
simply open up a nice spin up a virtual

547
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:40,540
machine I publish a web server and

548
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:43,360
basically I don't care of the security

549
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:47,170
or maybe

550
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,479
in this case the attackers were looking

551
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,420
for I think this was the first annoyed

552
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,760
it was Drupal get on to you are familiar

553
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:57,910
probably with a Drupal Gaiden Drupal is

554
00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:00,250
a content management server and every

555
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:03,820
more or less three months there's a

556
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:07,809
serious vulnerability and criminals try

557
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:11,830
to exploit it to normally install crypto

558
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:14,889
checkers in this case they were scanning

559
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:18,100
for vulnerable Drupal servers for in

560
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:22,120
also in this was different because it

561
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:24,879
was a home router or basically in the in

562
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:32,049
the third case they were looking for

563
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:36,390
they were trying to guess the JBoss

564
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:43,720
version to exploit these two probably

565
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:46,330
exploit the CVE 20:17 etc but after ten

566
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,490
minutes someone was knocking something

567
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:51,189
actually because was probably about was

568
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:53,679
knocking at my door to see is there any

569
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:57,730
vulnerability that I can exploit for any

570
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,309
purposes so imagine what does this mean

571
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:02,679
basically today to have a cloud

572
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:04,270
applications or a cloud application on

573
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,790
these services which is not patched

574
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,889
because the problem is that now okay

575
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:11,950
the criminals don't simply compromised

576
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:15,870
the application they can enter if it's

577
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:18,940
unsecured and move horizontally and

578
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:22,600
compromised other services used for from

579
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:27,100
the same organization there was an

580
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:32,409
example I don't remember but basically I

581
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:36,939
yes do you know my inner wallet my

582
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:41,520
wallet basically was compromised I think

583
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:46,120
it was October and the attackers the

584
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:48,668
attack point for the attackers was the

585
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:55,870
DNS of the company that was stored on

586
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:57,420
AWS was route 53 it was not secured

587
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,459
enough

588
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:02,680
the attackers were able to enter read

589
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:06,220
change it the records and hijack that

590
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:08,350
the traffic so we are bringing

591
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,900
everything in the cloud and not only the

592
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:13,689
data of our organization of the

593
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:16,390
organization's but also the services so

594
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:19,960
the implications the consequences of a

595
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:23,770
compromise can basically spread in

596
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:26,560
multiple sectors from the data to the

597
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:29,730
DNS configuration can impact the

598
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,710
organization itself can impact also the

599
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:39,390
the supply chain the partners the a

600
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:43,120
ecosystem and so on so yeah this is an

601
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:46,750
example we as I said before crypto

602
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,159
jackeen was basically let's say that

603
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:54,060
coin hive has been among the

604
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:58,870
protagonists of these 2018 and 2019

605
00:33:54,060 --> 00:34:00,580
InfoSec here but the problem is that the

606
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,679
price of the crypto currencies is

607
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:05,169
becoming more and more volatile and

608
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,300
basically the guys behind the coin hive

609
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:10,690
have decided to abandon the project so

610
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:13,449
now having be having resources to

611
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,280
exploit in order to mine is becoming

612
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:21,668
more and more important and obviously

613
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:26,130
these resources are in the cloud I can

614
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:30,969
the size of let's say the possible

615
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:34,600
victims of a crypto jackin attack

616
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:38,469
through for instance something like coin

617
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,839
hive must be very high in order to make

618
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:44,020
the attack profitable but if I'm able to

619
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:46,500
go to the cloud to compromise resources

620
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:50,259
in the cloud where I can have much more

621
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,870
from processing power without obviously

622
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,110
paying the bill that's much more

623
00:34:52,870 --> 00:34:57,700
interesting for the attackers and that's

624
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:01,090
the reason why obviously they are

625
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:09,810
looking at is resources in order to

626
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:09,810
basically launch these kind of attacks

627
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:17,609
and these are the consequences yes this

628
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:20,920
is that's the example of my ether wallet

629
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:24,040
we're basically not actually twas April

630
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,339
2018 my memory is fading unfortunately

631
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:32,349
but obviously there was recently a

632
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:34,450
report by AT&T and basically creeped the

633
00:35:32,349 --> 00:35:36,520
jacking of businesses cloud resources

634
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,578
still going strong and behind this

635
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:42,910
there's always the miss configuration

636
00:35:39,579 --> 00:35:45,550
lack of visibility and so on if I have a

637
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:49,750
misconfigured server basically it's not

638
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:51,730
only now possibly billion of people

639
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:56,650
people on the internet can take

640
00:35:51,730 --> 00:36:02,170
advantage of that and these are the

641
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:04,869
consequences so that's what I basically

642
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:07,750
cryptocurrency miners are installed in

643
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:12,040
corporate environments and point

644
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:15,040
scanners will miss the the file or

645
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,750
basically flag the file as potentially

646
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:22,119
unwanted applications but yeah basically

647
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:24,430
it's important to be able to compromise

648
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,869
as many resources as possible in the

649
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:28,118
cloud because that's where the

650
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:31,480
processing power is and can make this

651
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,119
kind of attacks profitable giving the

652
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:38,349
fluctuations of the value of the

653
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,299
cryptocurrencies this was another

654
00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:43,390
example as I said before this is

655
00:36:40,299 --> 00:36:45,940
probably not so recent anymore but we

656
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:49,029
found everything in cloud storage you

657
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:52,809
know how coin hype works basically it's

658
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:56,160
a cloud it's a JavaScript library so I

659
00:36:52,809 --> 00:37:00,670
can run it from everywhere and when the

660
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:06,540
coin hype frenzy was high we were able

661
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:10,000
to detect basically a guy in a certain

662
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:14,400
organization this guy had just copied a

663
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,380
static page inside its onedrive

664
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,329
organization account and for trying this

665
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,700
static page was compromised with the

666
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:25,190
coin hive or actually was

667
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:27,740
coin hive had been injected and

668
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,710
basically it was just a static health

669
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:33,310
page but every people of the same

670
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:37,600
organization visiting this page was

671
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:41,060
illicitly mining cryptocurrencies

672
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:43,660
because the page was infected was it had

673
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:46,009
been injected with the coin hive and

674
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:48,859
this is another example of the

675
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:51,340
implications that may occur when

676
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:55,100
basically because the cloud can

677
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:59,510
propagate this kind this the malware the

678
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:02,500
nasty things much quicker as I said

679
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:04,370
before it's funny now coin IVA has been

680
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,370
discontinued because it's not profitable

681
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:09,859
anymore so I'm curious to see what the

682
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:12,020
crooks will invent maybe they will try

683
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:16,190
to compromise even more cloud resources

684
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:18,680
to have more processing power these are

685
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,840
this is another example by ok

686
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:24,440
brute-forcing weak password for public

687
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:26,960
facing servers that's the way where the

688
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,570
when the initial attack to tesla

689
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,930
happened because basically they had a

690
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:35,450
cuban 80 anonymous instance and so the

691
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:37,940
attackers were able to enter they were

692
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:41,899
scanning they they were they they okay

693
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:43,760
let's just try and see but and you know

694
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,630
there are so many statistics on the

695
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,860
weaknesses of passwords dead again 1 2 3

696
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:54,050
4 5 6 etc and today basically trying

697
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:58,220
these passwords in cloud services it's

698
00:38:54,050 --> 00:39:00,680
basically it's a nearly for free there

699
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:02,990
are so many tools so many ways to do it

700
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:08,210
but obviously again the consequences can

701
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:11,810
be very bitter for an organization I can

702
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,670
if I have my data on office 365 and my

703
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:16,790
company that doesn't have multi-factor

704
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:18,620
authentication or ID or a proper

705
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,950
password policy obviously it's very

706
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:24,290
simple to scan to basically if I want to

707
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:26,990
target a certain organization I can see

708
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:29,090
if these organization is office 365 I

709
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,640
can guess the domains I can guess the

710
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:36,380
emails and I can run similar attacks on

711
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:38,720
office on AWS etc and

712
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,869
the problem is that basically if I ever

713
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,379
miss configured password today is not

714
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:48,099
like having it in the post-it note where

715
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,740
only the people in my office can see it

716
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:54,529
it's just like having it on a post-it

717
00:39:51,740 --> 00:40:00,558
note that is visible by the whole

718
00:39:54,529 --> 00:40:03,109
internet the problem is that of course

719
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:05,539
is not only the technology the problem

720
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:08,299
is that people are facing the cloud but

721
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:13,970
I like to say that too many of them have

722
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:16,400
still a mindset an on-prem mindset they

723
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:18,558
are they are using the cloud but they

724
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,589
believe that ok I can have the password

725
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:24,890
1 3 4 5 6 and I can stick my password in

726
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:25,819
the monitor through a post-it it's not

727
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,700
like this anymore

728
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:30,890
unfortunately you shouldn't do it you

729
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,890
should not do it in your post-it in your

730
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:37,788
monitor obviously but absolutely you

731
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,680
haven't to do it in with the cloud

732
00:40:37,789 --> 00:40:42,940
applications because potentially

733
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:50,480
everybody connects can use this weakness

734
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:51,440
to break into and these are some

735
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,069
examples

736
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,009
basically diamine misconfigured s3 I

737
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:00,380
don't remember where I did it but AWS

738
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:03,339
employee flap exposes s3 bucket

739
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:07,369
containing GoDaddy server GoDaddy

740
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:09,828
4,000,000 Time Warner Cable Records this

741
00:41:07,369 --> 00:41:12,440
one happened the misconfigured boss

742
00:41:09,829 --> 00:41:16,160
accounts lead to sensitive data leaks

743
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,309
this one open 9 days ago I just wanted

744
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,700
to see an update and just went of course

745
00:41:19,309 --> 00:41:24,470
it also headed to the news but you can

746
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,950
see that this kind of attacks these kind

747
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:30,379
of breaches are very very frequent and

748
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:32,960
here of course the technology can help

749
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,210
to enforce stronger passwords but of

750
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,720
course it's up to the users to make sure

751
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:41,119
that I mean I must have proper policies

752
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:43,098
I must have proper technologies to

753
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:49,200
enforce the policies but obviously even

754
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:51,930
the users must be Savior so

755
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,098
I think it's 45 minutes I'm perfect its

756
00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:58,169
1214

757
00:41:53,099 --> 00:42:01,230
I'm impressed by myself so takeaways as

758
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,880
the usage of cloud services increase the

759
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,099
keychain has evolved and Islam

760
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,020
leveraging cloud resources in multiple

761
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:11,190
stages of the attacks as we have seen

762
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:14,130
for the cloud the new killed the the new

763
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:16,980
the the role of cloud services in the

764
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:19,020
kill chain cloud services are useful for

765
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,530
targeted and opportunistic operations

766
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:24,270
for delivering malware Alstine common

767
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:28,260
and control infrastructure hosting

768
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:31,140
phishing pages they they can be the keys

769
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,619
of the kingdom sorry but also people can

770
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,970
enter and steal data but also abused for

771
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:41,570
other purposes

772
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:44,368
and obviously proper processes and

773
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:48,540
technologies must be in place also the

774
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:50,490
process is because easy it's useless

775
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,099
sorry to spend the money for cloud

776
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:57,509
technologies if the users mindset is

777
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:59,550
on-prem and also of course if I have a

778
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:03,540
certain security policy if I have a

779
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:07,440
certain security level I must make sure

780
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:10,829
that also my supply chain is compliant

781
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,560
with that because obviously if I have a

782
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:16,319
weak element in my supply chain this

783
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:19,049
weak element will be exploited and will

784
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,029
vanish all the money and all the

785
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:22,980
technical demands I've all the money

786
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,079
I've spent all the technologies I have

787
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:27,599
in place and there have been multiple

788
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,740
examples of attacks carried out through

789
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:34,530
cloud applications via a weak supply

790
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,200
chain for example you maybe remember all

791
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,770
this thing that happened with the mage

792
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:43,049
cart when they compromised they

793
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:46,470
compromised an artificial intelligence

794
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:48,210
company and obviously all the customers

795
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:50,459
all the entities customers of this

796
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:53,670
company were compromised

797
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,310
actually was it a chatbot a company

798
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:58,530
providing chat bot services to multiple

799
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:02,470
customers it was compromised and

800
00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:06,430
obviously all the customers were where

801
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:08,410
consequently compromised and I believe

802
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:10,629
and this is even actually more important

803
00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:12,580
from the cloud because of the cloud

804
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:15,750
since maybe I am getting the service

805
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:18,759
from someone else and I have no idea

806
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:22,690
what is happening on the other side

807
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:26,010
where I take the service from and that's

808
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:28,510
well there that was all from my side and

809
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:30,070
thank you for your time thank you for

810
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:33,990
attending this presentation and

811
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:48,700
obviously if you have questions I'm here

812
00:44:33,990 --> 00:45:05,589
Thank You Paolo any questions you all

813
00:44:48,700 --> 00:45:08,560
hungry no questions okay by the way we

814
00:45:05,590 --> 00:45:11,109
have a booth actually so if you have

815
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,480
other maybe if any questions come to

816
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:15,819
your mind in the meantime you know how

817
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:18,720
to reach us thank you again

818
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,720
Thanks
