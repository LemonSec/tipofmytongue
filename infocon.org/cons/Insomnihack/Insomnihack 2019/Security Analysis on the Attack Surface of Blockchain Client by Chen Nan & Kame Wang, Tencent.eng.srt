00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,259
hello ladies and gentlemen it's my honor

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:27,220
to come here my name is China

5
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,830
this is my partner Kim Wong we are come

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:33,070
from test and agenda life

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:38,250
our topic is the security analysis on

8
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:38,250
the attack services oblak Chang client

9
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:46,569
first of all let me introduce myself I

10
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:49,900
am a security researcher my fist was a

11
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:52,629
mainly focused on the security of a blog

12
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:56,229
channel Windows kernel and the

13
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:59,500
virtualization hi

14
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:01,930
I am Kim wall I am a PhD of Chinese

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,479
Academy of Sciences my research

16
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:07,810
interests include blood test curity

17
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,530
automatic code analysis and test and the

18
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,700
mobile security I used to be a speaker

19
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:18,340
on a census at 2000 and 2017 it is well

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:22,270
the top four Academy conferences are in

21
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:24,520
project last year I also made a speech

22
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,140
on teacher conference which was paradigm

23
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,899
held in Beijing we all come from 10-lap

24
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:34,630
Tizen Inc our leader is about the most

25
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:37,659
famous trackers from China whose idea is

26
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:40,658
you angle here is extract extremely good

27
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:43,210
at Warner ability mining and exploiting

28
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:46,539
our Windows system in the last year

29
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:50,859
three of our researchers are on the MMF

30
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:54,280
RC top 100 list we are also the winner

31
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:56,829
upon to own 2001 2017

32
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:01,719
if you are interested on us you can find

33
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:04,029
us on Twitter the aDNA our talk is here

34
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:06,639
we were firstly introduced the

35
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,740
background of our research and the the

36
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:09,639
text surfaces of block 10 nodes will be

37
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,670
presented

38
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:15,839
thirdly we were also some tweaks to find

39
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:19,149
vulnerabilities in these hard surfaces

40
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,380
some real cases or vulnerabilities will

41
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:23,110
also be present

42
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:27,340
in the end we will meet make a short

43
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:30,940
conclusion the Nizoral plotter is a

44
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,310
distributed laser our p2p Network taking

45
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:36,370
the top public blockchain project as an

46
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,410
example a user to digital concurrency

47
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,130
account is a parallel public key and

48
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,770
private key such as of an account is the

49
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,049
house of the public key if a user want

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,360
to make a transaction he will need to

51
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,790
sign the transaction message using his

52
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,090
private key and broadcast it onto the

53
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,980
p2p network this message will include

54
00:02:55,090 --> 00:03:01,030
the current address of the sender and

55
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:04,720
receiver and the amount of digital

56
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:07,390
currencies and so up blocks can be

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,130
regarded as pieces of laser blocks and

58
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:12,160
can be thought like that this laser

59
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,880
pieces are linked together for public

60
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,220
Bloxham projects the generator will new

61
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,680
blocks can get get awarded in the

62
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,840
familiar with these local currencies the

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:30,610
process of generating new blocks are

64
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:34,120
called mine I'm 2017 we're presented by

65
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:36,820
Bitcoin the explosive price rise o the

66
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,150
digital currencies have rejected a lot

67
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,180
of attention and interest on the Block

68
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:45,640
on the blocks and technique besides

69
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,910
public blocks have which I already used

70
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:52,059
to issue digital concurrences companies

71
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:54,329
are almost more focused on how to apply

72
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:57,370
blocks and technique on real projects

73
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,310
the finer the financial companies are

74
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:02,800
most interested on the on this new kind

75
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,580
of technique furthermore the cloud

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,780
server service providers are also

77
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,560
providing solutions for blocks and

78
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:14,290
network many countries are also very

79
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,730
profitable for blocks and technique for

80
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,279
example onto onto 2015 America released

81
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,290
some swapping new rules for letting

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:28,210
virtue concurrency businesses in New

83
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:30,550
York City in stark contrast to the rapid

84
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,500
rise of blocks and technique the

85
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:36,290
security of blocks high cost system is

86
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:38,990
from Zachary sire we are we s attacks

87
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:40,700
how being reported in recent years most

88
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,310
direct attacks are tracking here our

89
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,430
owners are owners with digital

90
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:49,250
currencies the wallet clients are the

91
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:51,140
most attractive target the second type

92
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,870
of attacks are talking around Sweden

93
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:56,960
platforms these attacks will result in

94
00:04:53,870 --> 00:05:00,020
very serious financial losses the last

95
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,450
attack type is target type is targeting

96
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,880
at the blocks and knows some corner

97
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,490
vulnerabilities may exist in the code

98
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,980
all blocks and not because of the huge

99
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,650
amount who knows the attacks will

100
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:17,840
unleash war abilities can result in a

101
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:20,570
lot score from losses in summary plotter

102
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,570
is a fast-growing new technique with a

103
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:26,450
rapid rental application however is

104
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:29,599
ecosystem is facing attacks from various

105
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:32,900
aspects therefore it is important to

106
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,660
study the security of blocks now that's

107
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:39,289
how look at that if the different kinds

108
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:41,540
of attack surfaces are blocked the

109
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,720
attack surfaces or plots a network can

110
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:47,270
be divided into three major categories

111
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:50,210
the first day is the RPC interface RPC

112
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:52,760
is short for the remote procedure call

113
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:55,370
interface the second is the p2p prot

114
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:57,620
interface which surely contains three

115
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,010
met three mean protocols which are

116
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:03,830
discovery synchronizes and consensus the

117
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:06,440
third is a smart smart conscious contact

118
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:10,849
whose version was is the main attack

119
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:13,640
surface let's have look adorbs first of

120
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,450
all let's have a look into the obvious

121
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,390
interfaces

122
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,150
RPC is a common feature all means - in

123
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:23,330
blocks and projects for plots a node is

124
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:25,969
Co officials continually click continue

125
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:29,030
wallet management concurrence in mind

126
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:32,120
block block validation and the p2p

127
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:34,219
communication yr a node is running it

128
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,590
should provide a way to config

129
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,830
functionalities or create some did of

130
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:41,890
the block plots an RPC interface is the

131
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:47,620
major implementation of this kind of UI

132
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:51,139
URI it is provided in the form 807 RPC

133
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,410
taking a theorem as an example it has

134
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,229
many versions of note programs which are

135
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,240
developed in various languages the

136
00:06:57,229 --> 00:07:00,710
default configurations of these clients

137
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,330
are only exposed their artists

138
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:05,960
interfaces to localhost

139
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:09,289
haiwa however the combiner dress can be

140
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,698
configured to public internet OSS which

141
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:13,070
will expose their artisan

142
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:15,800
functionalities as shown in the bottom

143
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:20,659
it can be done by specifying one

144
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,190
argument which is RTC in DDR many plots

145
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,169
and projects will divide their

146
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:27,380
interfaces into different models

147
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:30,109
according to their functions for example

148
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:34,219
the RTC models or theorem can be divided

149
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:37,340
to be divided into if personal net minor

150
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,830
and so on some models are enabled by

151
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:43,010
default and so in the first two boxes

152
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,190
users can create the enabled enabled

153
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,469
model list by using artisan models

154
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:51,469
interface the last model the last pops

155
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:54,020
shows that the list can be the list can

156
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:58,599
be configured when starting up a note by

157
00:07:54,020 --> 00:08:01,580
specifying one argument with his RTC API

158
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:03,880
besides different client programs may

159
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,310
provide their own RPC interface

160
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,520
interfaces and the models such as an

161
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:14,539
inferior client name depurate parity it

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,900
is highlighted in red corner in summary

163
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:21,050
if a node points is RPC on to its public

164
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:23,179
address these exposed artist interfaces

165
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:30,110
will under the threat or remote

166
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:33,979
attackers okay next is the p2p

167
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:36,169
discover attack service firstly p2p

168
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:37,880
network is different from the

169
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:41,478
traditional seus network

170
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:44,480
it doesn't converse centralizer slower

171
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,990
each how is knows computer server or

172
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,130
client because the nodes getting in and

173
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:54,860
out of our network is very frequent

174
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,900
those in stature network are able to

175
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,220
maintain or full amount of routine

176
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,860
information there

177
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,890
this requires a way to find the target

178
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:11,860
nodes or resource that is the p2p

179
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:15,069
discover protocol let's take the

180
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:19,020
assyrians p2p discover protocol as an

181
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:22,900
example it's a protocol piece on Khedira

182
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:26,319
algorithm as is true in the fever

183
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:31,060
each node keeps a list of see the news

184
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,790
and the list of neighbor knows the city

185
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:37,449
nodes are fixed that are maintained

186
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:41,020
alive for a long time neighbor nodes are

187
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,560
found through the discover protocol this

188
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:48,880
protocol is based on UTP and the content

189
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,219
of the four types our Peggy's foster the

190
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,120
node editor my connectivity is rope in

191
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,280
pump then send a find a node packet of

192
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,880
is the target ID that you are looking

193
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:01,900
for your neighbors and returns a site

194
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,370
all nodes

195
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,560
closest to the target then you can

196
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:13,120
repeat the process over and over again

197
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:16,329
like her snuba about the implementation

198
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,790
details of the protocol is right for the

199
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:24,690
such crude implementation i will usurp

200
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:28,660
his rooms when next is the p2p

201
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:31,210
synchronization attack surface the state

202
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:35,410
all nodes in p2p network is very

203
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:38,680
complicated some are new news and some

204
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:42,360
are offline news and some time will

205
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,160
highlight evocatively so we need the

206
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,640
synchronization protocol Center let's

207
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,280
all nerds oh how was the sim state in

208
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,230
the block transistor there are usually

209
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:56,949
three types or with the attesting

210
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:00,570
realization they are synchronizing block

211
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:04,680
chanted broadcasting block did and

212
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:04,680
broadcast intersection did

213
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,500
let's take each Durham's Peter pistol

214
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:15,369
ionisation protocol as an example the

215
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:19,269
first is the secret link blockchain

216
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:23,449
there are some situations to trigger it

217
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:27,019
for example well a new node is added it

218
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:30,639
will synchronize well a new block is

219
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:34,699
received a synchronization is triggered

220
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:38,990
in addition every 10 seconds it will

221
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:42,199
positively synchronize the second is a

222
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:45,470
block broadcast well a new block is

223
00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:49,099
mined it will be broadcasted to the

224
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:51,620
entire network in addition when a new

225
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:55,940
block is received it will also be

226
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:59,000
broadcasted the third is the transaction

227
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:02,120
broadcast when a new transaction is

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,209
received it will be broadcasted to the

229
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,959
internet work when you send our

230
00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:14,449
transaction

231
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:18,439
it will also be broadcasted this is p2p

232
00:12:14,449 --> 00:12:20,479
consensus attack surface because the

233
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,209
news in the blockchain are already

234
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,750
called each node has the right to

235
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:28,670
general block so how to determine whose

236
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:31,790
block should be entered through the

237
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:38,329
chain consensus protocol could solve

238
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:39,319
this problem let's take a look under how

239
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:43,699
the interims

240
00:12:39,319 --> 00:12:46,310
consensus solves this problem histogram

241
00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:50,540
uses the proof of work consensus

242
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:53,060
protocol and the name suggests blocks

243
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,620
are selected according to the our

244
00:12:53,060 --> 00:13:00,199
difficulty also known as a suet

245
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:04,220
the figure is the generation process of

246
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:06,680
the new block a miner will calculate a

247
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,350
hash value which combines the

248
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,290
transactions information block

249
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:16,639
information hash key for the previous

250
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:20,349
block and they're not number this hash

251
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:22,600
is the computer with happy to value

252
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:25,830
if the hash value is less than the tacky

253
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,430
to one do the mining is successful

254
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:34,240
otherwise the above steps are repeated

255
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:37,630
with another nonce number when the block

256
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,510
is the broadcast the other nodes of the

257
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:43,360
oven it did is a difficult visit a key

258
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:51,370
the value in order to determine whether

259
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:54,300
to accept it or not there are a lot of

260
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,310
manners in the whole block chain network

261
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,589
in some cases

262
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,800
another major civil multiple blocks and

263
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:07,120
scissors sim heat and the boost blocks

264
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,189
are legal at this point the noodle will

265
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,730
select the one block according to the

266
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:15,130
difficulty of the block the difficulty

267
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:18,250
depends on window blocker was created

268
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:25,870
and it also depends the history called

269
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:28,540
difficulty of the chair okay this is the

270
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:32,110
smart contractor in the breaching attack

271
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:35,589
service smart contracts are like our

272
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:38,550
secure script on added piece it is used

273
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:43,150
to implement business logic on the

274
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:47,109
blockchain platform it could annotate

275
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:50,560
are stored on the blockchain you early a

276
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:53,980
smart contract is a binary array just

277
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:58,540
like a Windows PFL it has its own form

278
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:01,420
it the smart contract creator the web

279
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:05,380
the contractor and the since it had to

280
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:08,579
the blockchain knows it is transmitted

281
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:12,430
on the pieces all would transaction

282
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:16,750
users can also invoke smart contracts by

283
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:19,680
sending transactions to note the

284
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:24,930
blockchain node is responsible for

285
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:24,930
parsing and executing the smart contract

286
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:34,959
okay let's take a look and harder is

287
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:37,540
rooms into pretty smart contracts the

288
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:41,739
figure on the right shows the processing

289
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,740
of the smart contract first contract the

290
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:50,140
developers rent a soft crota visa script

291
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:52,060
languages such as the stolidity then the

292
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:56,500
soft coral will be compared the tool

293
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:58,719
obscured bias next the best are sent to

294
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,529
the blockchain network using the

295
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:07,260
transaction remaining block and the

296
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:11,200
verifying block it will be deployed

297
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,720
smart contract is executed the u.s. tech

298
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:17,110
based of water immersion also known as

299
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:21,510
the UVM the EVF is responsible for

300
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:25,390
parsing Okuda and passing parameters and

301
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:28,779
performing operations the life of finger

302
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:36,459
lists a part of IBM's OPA code such as

303
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:39,040
ient Moreau Saba and so on the core does

304
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:42,939
Mac contractor and dessert client are in

305
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,339
different is excursion context so

306
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,930
contract account do client style

307
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:52,660
operations their father client provides

308
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:55,920
some API for the smart contract which is

309
00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:01,029
this core you can think of it as a

310
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:04,480
wrapper all war of truth let's take her

311
00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:07,919
look answer orange is the Cisco as an

312
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,599
example the figure of the writer

313
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,660
indicates as enter a trance or Cisco up

314
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:16,770
record this okie code helps the smart

315
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:20,829
contractor developer invoke the reverse

316
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:25,109
functions provided by the node such as

317
00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:25,109
the functions list on the Left finger

318
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:34,780
after analyzing this attack surfaces

319
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:38,559
let's talk about how to find the one or

320
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:41,290
abilities in that if the RV's interfaces

321
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,930
are not protected where it will result

322
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,639
in very serious consequences that was

323
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,360
learning from another student from a

324
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:51,850
real case as early as 2016

325
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,760
while researcher claims that claimed

326
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,850
that his fanny pot has detected remotes

327
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,820
the honor in the theorem network at the

328
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:03,669
beginning of 2018 this kind of attack

329
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,950
got reposted by different groups also

330
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:09,850
these kind of attacks have been posted

331
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:12,790
for so many times the attacks never stop

332
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:16,899
by now well the most famous attackers

333
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:20,260
account has stolen more than sixty forty

334
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:22,360
four thousand thousand ethers which is

335
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:24,910
the digital currency issued by the a

336
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,370
theorem this account is still receiving

337
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:30,130
stolen interest from day to day the

338
00:18:27,370 --> 00:18:32,340
stolen ethers are worth more than more

339
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:35,170
than found meaning you have dollars

340
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,120
let's check out how our attacker cast

341
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,630
the other ethers from a weak teams node

342
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:43,270
remotely first of all here we attack if

343
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:45,730
the target knows RPC RPC interface is

344
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,560
open if yes he we are trying to create

345
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,850
the wallet information from the node and

346
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:54,310
then the node to cinahl is balanced to

347
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:56,590
the attackers account the success

348
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:59,440
condition for the third step is that the

349
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,590
victim's account is should be unlocked

350
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,900
to allow the ethers to be sent out there

351
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,870
are two different situations situation

352
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,420
what the attacker knows the password of

353
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:16,149
the victim's account however this is

354
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:19,780
very hard to achieve situation - is that

355
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:22,900
the county-town is a loved by the its

356
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:25,090
owner under this situation if the if the

357
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,120
account is not a real octoman ually by

358
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,399
the owner there will be a time window

359
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,840
for attackers to invoke the RPC

360
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,720
interface to send ethers let's make a

361
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,959
summary summary if the area knows our

362
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,670
Warner about or RPC attacks because that

363
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,770
firstly they expose their sensitive

364
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,520
artists interfaces and implement no

365
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:50,590
effective caller identity authentication

366
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,440
secondly the node programs provider

367
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,490
unsafe wallet also if wallet management

368
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,799
whistle

369
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,360
sounds like unlocked Wally to be really

370
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,600
really worth hum window for some

371
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,389
sections thirdly our user nodes are

372
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,369
detectable otherwise the records could

373
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:10,360
not find the last amount of victims to

374
00:20:06,369 --> 00:20:14,799
steal based on these three and if this

375
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,199
terrific risk risk factors less how was

376
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:22,690
hack artist and some other females

377
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:25,389
Bloxham project bitcoin has employment

378
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,990
well implemented very effective RTC

379
00:20:25,389 --> 00:20:31,840
identity authentications therefore it is

380
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:34,419
Civ UF network is divided into different

381
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,158
levels all the users knows are not

382
00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:39,850
connecting with each other by p2p

383
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,279
protocol therefore even though the other

384
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:45,789
two vectors are matched the threat of a

385
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:48,730
fleece attacks in the in the UF network

386
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:51,490
is very limited repos are his interface

387
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,740
that don't provide wallet management it

388
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:56,080
only takes care of publishing

389
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:59,200
transaction messages on to the network

390
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:03,668
which is already signed by users so that

391
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,590
it is safe to lastly NGO is upload some

392
00:21:03,669 --> 00:21:08,080
project which messes all these three

393
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,709
factors the taxis network has already

394
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:18,610
been advised by our team and the details

395
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:22,149
will be discussed later now let's talk

396
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:24,309
about how to find bugs in code also

397
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:27,549
there are hundreds out blockchain

398
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:31,450
clients they are few truly independently

399
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:35,940
developed their clients most are copies

400
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:40,869
and customization our classical projects

401
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:45,580
you just need to familiar with several

402
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:51,340
very new clients such as the ptc eth us

403
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:54,100
and so on if you want to faster analyze

404
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:57,639
a new blog tram project there are some

405
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:00,459
different situations if the project is

406
00:21:57,639 --> 00:22:04,899
based out with a clock secure project

407
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:07,210
easy took a start you can check it if it

408
00:22:04,899 --> 00:22:11,050
has any NT bugs

409
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,800
if it is an independent project fourthly

410
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:18,159
it is not a real common tool we deserve

411
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:19,030
that paper directly just the downloads

412
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:23,830
are screwed

413
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:26,379
come here and run secondly you can use

414
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:30,580
some chicks to quickly find the sum of

415
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,400
your sparks finally you need to do deep

416
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:40,840
into the code look at the issue attack

417
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:43,630
studies and the auditors are blocked and

418
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,870
clients are usually implemented in a

419
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:51,120
variety of languages such as deployed

420
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,770
pass go Java and and so on

421
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,879
the problem with simpler brands is

422
00:22:53,770 --> 00:23:01,780
obvious since the pointers are prone to

423
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:03,400
memory access errors other languages

424
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,610
also can cause problems

425
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:12,070
even without the pointers such as the oh

426
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:15,340
I am Ruby and so on even a two eyes of

427
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:19,990
an ability can have a big impact on the

428
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:23,409
blockchain like breaking mining and

429
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:30,040
bringing you data section it could even

430
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:32,560
cause a 51% of the attacks there are

431
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,580
some common park situations star transit

432
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:40,300
about access integer overflow type of

433
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:44,620
conversion field and the map in 10,000

434
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:47,050
eggs exist or under not checked allocate

435
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:51,699
memory is too large and the rest

436
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:57,430
condition and so on most languages have

437
00:23:51,700 --> 00:24:01,210
other above problems you could believe

438
00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:04,600
that a lot all blockchain code isn't our

439
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,990
high quality we will have many basic

440
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,230
errors so you can summarize someone

441
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:14,980
ability patterns for the languages you

442
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:18,100
want to study the user patterns the two

443
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,389
structures are screwed directly you will

444
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,478
be

445
00:24:19,389 --> 00:24:29,049
essentially surprised let's make go

446
00:24:25,479 --> 00:24:33,009
languages as an example I read my own

447
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:34,779
patterns using regular expressions you

448
00:24:33,009 --> 00:24:36,009
can also read more at the West the

449
00:24:34,779 --> 00:24:40,799
structure programs

450
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:44,519
it might work better firstly this is a

451
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,289
pattern over type conversions such as

452
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:50,889
string conversion and the entire

453
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:55,719
conversion in the two languages there is

454
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:58,809
a non-safe type conversion syntax like

455
00:24:55,719 --> 00:25:07,409
the code showing the fever which we are

456
00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:11,499
cause panic let's look at an example

457
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:15,419
this is the result our search for stream

458
00:25:11,499 --> 00:25:19,989
type conversions in your blog project as

459
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:23,169
you can see it uses or unsafe type

460
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:26,679
conversions because the karati the value

461
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:34,329
can be controlled by an attacker it can

462
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:38,019
cause panic secondly these are this is a

463
00:25:34,329 --> 00:25:40,029
pattern of a memory allocation in the

464
00:25:38,019 --> 00:25:43,149
code languages you can use meek to

465
00:25:40,029 --> 00:25:47,079
create a dynamic array and the

466
00:25:43,149 --> 00:25:50,379
initialized is a size if the initial

467
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:50,999
size is too large it will cost out of a

468
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:59,529
memory

469
00:25:50,999 --> 00:26:02,469
the program will exceed this is an

470
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:05,589
example synthesis we start our search

471
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:09,879
for memory allocation in a logjam

472
00:26:05,589 --> 00:26:13,299
project the memory size is controlled by

473
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:21,339
a remote attacker which we are resulted

474
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:23,789
in out of memory suddenly this is a

475
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:26,559
pattern of entire overflow

476
00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:29,200
integral overflow errors are very common

477
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,360
and we found was there were the

478
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,100
consequences

479
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:37,399
Partin matching for entitle overflow is

480
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:42,409
not easy it has a lot of emergencies and

481
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:45,680
a lot of a filter going to do this is an

482
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:48,610
example senator result of our search for

483
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,700
entire overflow in a block type project

484
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:55,669
and failed and the original field can be

485
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,430
controlled by attackers integral

486
00:26:55,670 --> 00:27:05,900
overflow occurs of an end is less than

487
00:26:58,430 --> 00:27:10,670
tha or region there are some other

488
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:12,560
patterns first out our bound access it

489
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,730
often happens of an erisa

490
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:21,110
are exceed so this regular expression is

491
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:27,470
used to find the code center associated

492
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:33,439
with re oxides secondly English in

493
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:36,710
vector map in text if there is no

494
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,070
interest in the map the extracted the

495
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:43,100
result of Araby empty if there is a code

496
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:47,540
to access it with no tracking it will

497
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:50,510
cause problems so to find out this

498
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:54,879
problem first of all you should get all

499
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:59,150
map objects by finder mimic mind and

500
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,630
then check it the uch by reference many

501
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:08,510
ide has have the ability to find the

502
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:12,580
references soldered a rest condition it

503
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:14,800
often happens in multi-threading

504
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:17,330
therefore they are looking for

505
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,230
multi-threaded functions and the

506
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:26,060
oddities are could observe we can focus

507
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:27,920
on peps global variables and the other

508
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:33,560
resource is the shared by multiple

509
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:35,480
threads notice since the above all

510
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,810
patterns are all based on the good

511
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,420
syntax different languages has different

512
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:44,440
details you need to read the patterns

513
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,440
for other languages

514
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,830
if you want to find the more one ability

515
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,830
is the Union took those deeply into the

516
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:57,439
code it will take more time because you

517
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,760
need to understand all kinds of

518
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:04,580
protocols and algorithm

519
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,560
it also can some chicks you Justin

520
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:09,409
needed to follow the direction of the

521
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:16,669
attack surface then you won't get lost

522
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:20,270
in the ocean of code how to locate the

523
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:23,260
attack surface of course it's centrally

524
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:28,100
portable two leaders are inter code

525
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:30,500
however it this is time consuming here I

526
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,469
will give you some quick ways to look at

527
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:34,910
it firstly

528
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,460
guess the functionality is the piece

529
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:40,130
tons of your names they are more

530
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:45,230
concerned about pew pew obviously

531
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:48,440
message and so on secondly with such a

532
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:52,100
soft quota with keywords number one

533
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:56,180
switch many protocols has a switch for

534
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:59,510
parsing number to send or receive on a

535
00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:02,270
slower start these are network related

536
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:06,379
crews they are often used by workers

537
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:10,280
blog camp protocols number three message

538
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:13,520
all packets this Arthur could associated

539
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:18,010
with the packet or message network data

540
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:22,070
is transmitted using zone number four

541
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:25,370
Marshall also realize vendor code

542
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:32,960
associated with Marshall it is used when

543
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:36,139
network did instant and received for

544
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:39,500
example this is a typical message

545
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:42,890
passing entry it contains keywords star

546
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:45,590
is the switch message and the deserve

547
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:48,740
realization when we find these key

548
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:50,980
points it is much easier to audit or run

549
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,980
sir

550
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:59,110
yeah now have a look at how to do one

551
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:02,049
aerobic vulnerability man you are smart

552
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:04,479
contract well what you machine we can do

553
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:06,580
fatherhood auditing the contracts which

554
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,370
are developed and coding in the blocks a

555
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,189
network of see I realized the following

556
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:13,689
sodium formate certain form it if we can

557
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:15,870
write a wrapper for some certain

558
00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:18,190
functionality such as person and

559
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:20,350
interpreting the it is suitable to do

560
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:22,960
from expressing Oh God

561
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:25,570
code auditing is Ana is also suitable in

562
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,100
this situation it requires us to have a

563
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:30,250
deep understanding on the implementation

564
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,309
of the entire RIA to help locate one are

565
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:35,380
vulnerable components this piece

566
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:37,418
presents a real key is all fighting with

567
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,570
the area on the smart construct runtime

568
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:43,030
over you asked yo f knows the you have

569
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:45,220
no the implement a you have knows

570
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:48,190
implements is smart contract around time

571
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:51,909
based on to third-party open-source

572
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:55,330
projects name wev Armand binary I have

573
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:57,580
attracted the rap record o WM and

574
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:00,750
implementing this one program with

575
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:03,428
canticle by bytecode fire as an input to

576
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:05,429
make product to make pressing and

577
00:32:03,429 --> 00:32:08,710
interpreting

578
00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:13,929
wim therefore this program is suitable

579
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:15,789
to suit both two if a affair passing now

580
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:17,799
that's how we look at the real kisses

581
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:21,090
are warm vulnerabilities in different

582
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:24,309
attack attack attack surface interfaces

583
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,260
in this section we will analyze some

584
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:31,090
real Werner abilities in various table

585
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:34,658
plots and projects like in CRM us ptc

586
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:37,240
neo and allen key the first first of all

587
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:39,940
as how i look at their RPC security

588
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,530
problems there are two projects bound to

589
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:44,890
be one durable to this kind of problem

590
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:48,220
as introduced in our previous pieces in

591
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:50,260
theorem is well the is the second block

592
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:53,590
time project according to his market

593
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:56,440
what market value and a neo is amanda is

594
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:59,350
among the top 20 in order to have a

595
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,750
comprehensive resource under RPC attacks

596
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,260
we will need to figure out the following

597
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:07,030
following three questions number one how

598
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:09,250
many nodes are vulnerable number two

599
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,680
how serious are the attacks and number

600
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:14,260
three what matters are a Tetris and

601
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:16,990
everything in order to figure out these

602
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:19,450
questions we have developed an analysis

603
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,970
system it contains a honeypot a weak

604
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:23,920
teams need for and a note detector the

605
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,710
honey honey the honey pot which comes

606
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,230
from malicious RPC requests and find a

607
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,060
new attack marriage from this repast the

608
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:32,920
victim's name from will find out the

609
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:35,860
notes in the blocks a network whose

610
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:38,260
access interfaces are exposed the note

611
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:41,379
detector is a special component which

612
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,780
can risk a phone can find all the nodes

613
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,770
in the target blobs and network it is

614
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:49,300
the basic health other what other -

615
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:51,910
first of all let's have a look at how to

616
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,639
implement don't know detector the basic

617
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:57,400
idea is to query autumn other already

618
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,400
known knows about fear neighbor nodes

619
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,500
neighbor node list this can be

620
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:06,580
implemented by modifying the source code

621
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:09,250
of Nozomi imitating the PPP protocol by

622
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:12,100
ourselves The effect of this component

623
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:14,320
is that Omaha if it can make our

624
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:17,649
honeypot easier to be found by attackers

625
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,260
if they are deployed on when on the sim

626
00:34:17,649 --> 00:34:23,168
network device or the other hand it can

627
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,880
provide a candy a candidate list for the

628
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:26,830
victims neighbor to find one herbal

629
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,750
notes honey-poo

630
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,120
honeypot is another component in this

631
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:34,179
system the basic idea is to capture

632
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,000
request craft response and make record

633
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:39,668
to ensure the authentic of intensity of

634
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,739
the response response we can deploy our

635
00:34:39,668 --> 00:34:44,230
normal node for the honey pot operate it

636
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:47,879
in this way we only need to craft

637
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:50,830
response for some special interfaces

638
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:53,169
there are two kinds of special

639
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,969
interfaces the first are the interfaces

640
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:57,759
that can be leveraged to create

641
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:01,209
Institute's did such like account

642
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,790
addresses the the second are those

643
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:05,610
interfaces that that have been found to

644
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,170
be leveraged by attackers

645
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:11,440
victims neighbor is the third component

646
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,420
it is used to used to find all the one

647
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,040
urban nodes in the block to network it

648
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,650
will take the result all know the

649
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,710
detector component as a candidate list

650
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,720
for testing which can help to reduce the

651
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:24,160
list

652
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:27,640
first of all in the attacker if the

653
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,420
default RPC post port of the this

654
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,220
candidate nodes are exposed furthermore

655
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,770
to find one or one herbal notes that

656
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,410
thousands in 30 for our key support

657
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:41,319
I was never real never is a very

658
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:44,410
powerful tool name the mask to get other

659
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:48,700
exposed port our candidate node to do

660
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:51,160
filtered test this analysis system is

661
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,950
firstly applied on a theorem we have

662
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,490
given deploy the three test nodes on the

663
00:35:53,950 --> 00:36:00,368
tension cloud which looks tira which

664
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,970
located separately add is a Europe and

665
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:05,530
America the cost of deploying node

666
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:08,560
deploying this node aware are not very

667
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:12,940
expensive we saw about 14 u.s. dollars

668
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,190
month by month that has lasted Poland

669
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:17,230
when most the summaries of that has the

670
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:21,160
results of different nodes are showing

671
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:23,829
this in the second table if we make a

672
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,848
deeper study into the test results we

673
00:36:23,829 --> 00:36:29,200
can conclude to conclude three findings

674
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:31,390
number one the steering frigates

675
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,879
continue of all in ethers we saw the

676
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:36,549
mean we saw the measure this is how

677
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,890
concurrency issued by a theorem but also

678
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,930

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:08,049
are more than 15 15 nodes that have won

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:10,900
or about that are vulnerable to this

689
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:13,540
kind of problem and some of them was

690
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,109
asked mind you are being during our our

691
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:19,270
test our analysis system is also

692
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:22,299
deployed on any owner Proctor

693
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:25,089
our lab has exclusively disclose it

694
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,790
disclosed attack on December last year

695
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:30,730
the attack Mario's captured by our

696
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:33,640
honeypot as soon as the picture the no

697
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,900
the detector is implemented by analyzing

698
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,900
and imitating the

699
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:40,840
a Neos p2p protocol with successfully

700
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:44,140
detected other nose in the Neo Network

701
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:48,250
our victim detector has won more than

702
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:51,850
13% percent of a neo nose under threat

703
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:53,680
our remote a PC attack in conclusion the

704
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:56,950
RPC attacks the different blocks and

705
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,830
projects have similarities the analogy

706
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:04,540
system we see our Thea is put for

707
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:07,420
although in Esther let's look at an

708
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:10,600
example of disturbance p2p discover

709
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,630
protocol the problem occurred in the

710
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:15,370
ether on p2p is core protocol when

711
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:18,820
checking the topic that we just a

712
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:22,560
package the IPX affair the other packet

713
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:25,720
is defined as the unsigned integer type

714
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:29,190
which is not converted to integral when

715
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:33,580
checked without him in check failure and

716
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:37,240
overflow size a tankers can modify the

717
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:40,390
client code called the sender topic

718
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:41,160
regester function to set IDs to positive

719
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,720
one

720
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:47,740
anyway of course we moved us to the

721
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,660
target node the fix for this part is as

722
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:56,649
simple as the converting ideas to

723
00:38:49,660 --> 00:39:00,060
interval this is a example of a thermos

724
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:03,370
p2p is the grandmas Asian protocol this

725
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:06,190
problem occurs in the synchronization

726
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,890
protocol or vu is your moon-like note

727
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:13,060
when processing gate block height up

728
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:15,879
message and swings or fever just keep

729
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,970
field of the packet is controllable by

730
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:23,230
attacker and as there is no check for

731
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:25,649
integral overflow run a the +1 this

732
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:28,420
leads to out-of-bounds oxides

733
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:31,750
attacker can modify the client at the

734
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:34,540
cinder block hider message synthesizers

735
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:38,520
keeps the order to positive 1 it will

736
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,520
cause the target she knows us

737
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:47,170
this is a cat or war which is p2p

738
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:48,410
consensus protocol this problem occurs

739
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,740
in the

740
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:54,500
BFG consensus protocol in ont when

741
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:58,009
processing prepare requires the message

742
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:01,220
and swings of figure it creates an or

743
00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:04,610
rebalance however the list is controlled

744
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:08,169
by attacker as there is no check for its

745
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:10,730
value this leads to out of a memory

746
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:14,030
attack had modified the client

747
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:16,850
understand or prepare request message

748
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:20,180
that that size the release file the to a

749
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:27,710
positive one it will cause the target in

750
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:30,169
those doers this role of it has has a

751
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:32,390
severe number the vulnerable program

752
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:35,150
Bitcoin core is a popular client of

753
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,980
Bitcoin so one or ability exists in the

754
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:39,320
transaction validation process of a

755
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:40,010
newly received Park and so in this

756
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,230
picture

757
00:40:40,010 --> 00:40:44,360
Linda funk when the function tech

758
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:48,110
transaction is called with the third

759
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:51,200
parameter set to two it will enable the

760
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,750
tracked for time placated implicating

761
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,009
includes with the new transaction

762
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,850
however this check is very

763
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:58,190
time-consuming

764
00:40:55,850 --> 00:41:00,589
therefore developers have disabled it

765
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,900
because they believed that that it here

766
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:04,610
the the DTR the transaction handling

767
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:07,700
code cool that he could care of this

768
00:41:04,610 --> 00:41:11,090
kind of euro situation unfortunately it

769
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:13,310
didn't attackers calories are more from

770
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:16,160
the block to kiss the cross or normal

771
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:19,730
notes or successfully double spending in

772
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,759
his balance to achieve the dog attack

773
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:26,630
chess x2 is formed to contingent section

774
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:30,410
as an input twice in this attack Chaz x1

775
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:34,730
and transect to is recorded in the sim

776
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:39,049
plug and if transaction one is recorded

777
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:42,440
in your previous block trying to well we

778
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:44,630
are not kids at all is that other knows

779
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:47,870
other one urbanos we are believe that

780
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:52,210
transaction 2 is valid valid which we

781
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,210
are result in the double spend problem

782
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:57,308
here is another vulnerability it exists

783
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:00,290
in the smart contract contract

784
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:02,869
interpreting process El Nino notes it's

785
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:03,619
math contract is in the parameter W

786
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:06,619
ether

787
00:42:03,619 --> 00:42:08,900
well a news smart contract is deployed

788
00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:12,700
on the network nodes we are presently

789
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:15,049
interpret interpret a spec five codes

790
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,230
vulnerability exists in the interpreting

791
00:42:15,049 --> 00:42:21,530
process at location one the Warner about

792
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:24,770
over Rio offset is an attack control

793
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:28,790
controllable integral before fix the

794
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,359
value E offset is validated to prevent

795
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,400
integral flow using a short function

796
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,950
however a certain is not is not

797
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:40,280
applicable for not bad person therefore

798
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:42,980
the local reportable will be leveraged

799
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,430
to implement out of bound right at

800
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,859
location 3 to exploit this vulnerability

801
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:52,460
we can override and other models of code

802
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:56,480
and they invoke this more this model to

803
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:58,490
to attribute memory read and write this

804
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,079
is our problem that are crossing in the

805
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:05,529
smart contract the API for us as a

806
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,660
function of the upshot is to calculate a

807
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:12,109
multiplication it has an error checking

808
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:15,319
for overflow this problem is very subtle

809
00:43:12,109 --> 00:43:18,380
and showing the figure live tracker is

810
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:22,430
implemented from the source code however

811
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:26,119
when compared to WSM the Assad check is

812
00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:34,960
optimized there falls over floods have

813
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:37,910
failed now let's make a conclusion so

814
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:40,190
the increase in market value of digital

815
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:42,828
currencies has attracted lot of

816
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:45,530
attackers antigen on blocks and security

817
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:47,960
as a new technique blocks and projects

818
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:50,630
how exposed different kinds of attack

819
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,510
surfaces these effect surfaces have

820
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:57,170
attracted have been found to have real

821
00:43:53,510 --> 00:44:00,170
security problems even attack and evil

822
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:02,960
attack events wire plots and technology

823
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:04,400
is being applied in many in more and

824
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,070
more in touch with the Earth's new

825
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,150
security problems we are

826
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:11,860
more serious threat and ha fearful

827
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:15,030
making motive study on the blocks and

828
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:23,410
security is very important in the fields

829
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:25,960
okay that's all thank you thank you very

830
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:28,000
much for your presentation now if there

831
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:37,150
is any question you can just raise your

832
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:43,830
hand and I will give you the mic no

833
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:47,560
question okay thank you again and

834
00:44:43,830 --> 00:44:47,560
[Applause]
