[Music]

2
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:21,009
two remote code execution after you guys

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,500
hello everyone my name is in Hong Kong

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:27,470
this is my colleague yeah sure they come

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:31,000
from China they are the researchers of

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:34,300
with Suho statistical technology company

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,579
my work focuses on cloud computing

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,040
security and the Linux kernel security

9
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:44,739
and my colleague Ian Shaw is a team

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:47,480
member of full services so multi papery

11
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:51,739
personally conducted security research

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:55,428
on Linux system vulnerability and now

13
00:00:51,739 --> 00:00:58,120
focus on security research in the oil

14
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,120
t-direction

15
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:07,429
this topic is about IOT security I

16
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:10,700
believe that you guys have so so many

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:14,470
slides in many cyber security

18
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:18,680
conferences such as car will ability or

19
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:21,408
Reuter own abilities today I will share

20
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:26,840
something interesting means a fairly

21
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:32,540
storied device the early storage device

22
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:37,040
is a new type of IOT device in the this

23
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:40,180
device people can store personal data

24
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:45,100
like photograph or video

25
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:48,280
this type of IOT product has really been

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:54,048
discussed tight security conferences and

27
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:58,869
no clear project had been in dente fat

28
00:01:54,049 --> 00:02:03,409
hidden we have a vocal have found some

29
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:07,000
security problems of ethical hacker got

30
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:10,160
personal data from this type of device

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,980
the user could not connect with the

32
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:21,300
device to the public web or Wi-Fi

33
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:25,290
network by using this one ability

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:28,710
hikers can gather the remote root shell

35
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:34,590
of the device operating system without

36
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:40,380
any credentials and even can read and

37
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:43,590
write any data in the hard disk so the

38
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:47,810
wannabe tale is a high risk but this one

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:52,640
ability not only caused the loss son of

40
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:57,320
private data but also can be used as a

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:03,950
serving board for lat attack that is

42
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:07,200
separate turns on the line by infecting

43
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:13,160
certain fields located on the storage

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:16,260
devices the the content of this

45
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:20,220
presentation will cover the entire

46
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:25,459
process of analyzing Hardware analyzing

47
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:29,600
firmware fuzzing and explore dictation

48
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:34,700
one of it is otherwise our new

49
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:34,700
perspective on IOT to ask security

50
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:43,250
finally a complete emotional remote

51
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,080
Italy where devices to control and

52
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,150
obtaining in important the field of

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,150
thousands of the device will be giving

54
00:03:53,330 --> 00:04:01,080
this right contains three parts the in

55
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:04,500
the first one I introduce basic

56
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:08,730
information for motion about this device

57
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:12,330
and in the second part my colleague will

58
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:15,480
introduce introduce the service and how

59
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:19,350
to find a winner details in this type of

60
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:23,719
wood device and a user third heart I

61
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:29,630
will introduce this polarization to

62
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:32,430
vertical automatically find devices and

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,669
attack attack it in the Wi-Fi

64
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,669
environment

65
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:48,550
now they'll begin the first first part

66
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,369
the first part will include target and

67
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:56,170
target increment in promotion and how to

68
00:04:51,370 --> 00:05:05,620
get the full their hardware introduction

69
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:10,060
and software instruction the Evalia

70
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:14,350
storage to us is that analyze the belong

71
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:18,130
to the Western Digital company my

72
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:21,010
password awareness Pro is a portable

73
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:24,969
Mary Celeste or a device designed by

74
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:31,020
this fingers company is for other door

75
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:31,020
photographers and in tonight of since

76
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:40,270
hostess it can be used as a Wi-Fi server

77
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:43,660
all by client to establish connection

78
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:48,280
with the users mobile device users

79
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:52,630
access the data in this type of storage

80
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:58,179
device through the local area network so

81
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:02,440
it's the big attack surface in China we

82
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:12,460
have so many outdoor videographers use

83
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:15,610
this type of device it has a beauty SD

84
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:20,049
card reader photographers can copy the

85
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:24,010
cells of the SD card to the various hard

86
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:29,640
disk neva mobile device under the PC

87
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:34,450
device also catch to the cells remotely

88
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:38,159
if Widow coffers do not use this device

89
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:43,950
they must in inserted SD card into the

90
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,950
computer so they can view the photos

91
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:59,409
well I opened the story device I found

92
00:06:54,430 --> 00:07:03,640
the light it has a very complex board

93
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:07,120
than the traditional one in the middle

94
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:11,250
of the of the board that that is a

95
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:17,080
secured shape of the operating system

96
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:20,860
well a silent sock and the left of the

97
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:27,609
port that is a room shape where you can

98
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:31,180
stores the phone well on the right of

99
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:35,790
the board that is the RAM memory chip

100
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:42,580
and other below of the port that is a

101
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:48,940
wellness exercise point sheep the right

102
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:52,240
the right part is a power and the power

103
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:58,960
moves are of this picture we can see

104
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:01,300
that is the mechanical hard disk is a

105
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:15,400
mountain and the mountain on this

106
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:18,460
operation system and after analyzes a

107
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:22,359
holiday offices device I started to

108
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:26,370
think how to cut the foam where from the

109
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:31,590
room trip in general we can use this

110
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:34,890
nyserda for example we can ask further

111
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,409
after a upgraded package from the

112
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:45,819
official website or after ourselves

113
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:49,810
it's the list or we can analyze a lot

114
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:55,960
I've created precise and the capture the

115
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:59,170
package to cut as a load twice all we

116
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,490
also can reverse mobile applications of

117
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:06,709
the veer then that is a time

118
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:10,580
location of the result and we also can

119
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:17,660
use a hardware device to tackle it from

120
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:23,770
where and we can also use a programmer

121
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:32,649
to redo the firmware from slash so with

122
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:36,110
the last measure to gather the firmware

123
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:48,080
and therefore nearly the firmware is not

124
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:52,430
in craft hit then we look at the

125
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:57,080
software part this type of rarely store

126
00:09:52,430 --> 00:10:01,819
utilizes in clip division in embedded

127
00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:06,829
operating system Southwell sharing

128
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:10,220
software and the protocols pre-computer

129
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:12,979
down it then provide a lot of function

130
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:17,720
my colleague will introduce this in next

131
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:18,850
part and this device have three main

132
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:24,079
functions

133
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:29,709
the first one is open and to open and

134
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:33,620
close access point various hospice part

135
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:39,890
ii of managed to connect mobile device

136
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:45,130
and transfer files variously the third

137
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:49,550
one is to provide provider some external

138
00:10:45,130 --> 00:11:01,610
network service such as remote a meteor

139
00:10:49,550 --> 00:11:05,209
playback now my colleague folio is a

140
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:09,589
second part hello

141
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:11,500
the second part is the introduction of

142
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,050
who varlas

143
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:21,670
this vulnerability menu including from

144
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:31,060
which and apart from for vulnerability

145
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:36,130
meaning the fossa is actually the

146
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:41,760
surface of food events the dress is

147
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:50,380
about some more SIL silicone

148
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:54,790
assert a few vanessa is a family

149
00:11:50,380 --> 00:12:00,550
accurately measure psoriasis through wet

150
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:12,449
ground a plane through user flex our

151
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:16,089
grad programs the network is the network

152
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:20,500
transfer the the second is the

153
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:27,030
attractive service of the network and so

154
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:44,020
about its communication protocol such as

155
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:50,040
HTTP protocol and the UPnP protocol so

156
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:50,040
third is the actual surface of the cloud

157
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:02,470
SAT close race config yellow version and

158
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:10,770
the TDP servers and close service or an

159
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:15,330
ability weak password vulnerability okay

160
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:20,100
let's further this is a or nobility in

161
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:24,830
you first of all how to escalate servo

162
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:28,770
nobility in the first asleep my car is

163
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:35,550
Wireless had a disk so any also that

164
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:38,550
with is is essential webserver right way

165
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:43,740
slander is a member server without

166
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:48,270
studying with local programs how

167
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:52,910
servants because the LG device is a

168
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:57,090
different from the Linux PC host

169
00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:00,920
compared to the artist system so system

170
00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:07,130
as a corrupt version so far as much a

171
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:11,459
license and operating system of the PC

172
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:14,610
at the same time at the same time local

173
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:19,320
Warner ability our motive difficult to

174
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:26,100
take her on to LTS so ADA is necessary

175
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:31,590
in - so is necessary to rely our attacks

176
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:36,150
to Tegra so very perfect the network the

177
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:40,830
network serious of programs to escalate

178
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:45,390
the vulnerability from the position of

179
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:48,510
the open path and the service to attack

180
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:53,100
the server of who to national and LT

181
00:14:48,510 --> 00:15:00,900
dress has manually divided in three

182
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:07,040
types so first of the web server service

183
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:12,290
of the HTTP protocol the web server is

184
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:16,770
divided two tips one of the open-source

185
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:20,540
web service programs and the other as a

186
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:24,569
web server program are rated by

187
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:29,459
themselves under the second table is

188
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:37,830
a plug-and-play service a plan can spawn

189
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:47,640
into the UPnP protocol but me fashion is

190
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:53,870
the talk of perform part mattheum and

191
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:57,689
the third one is the service discount

192
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:05,390
discovery protocol service are written

193
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:10,980
by some cells some waters will write

194
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:21,449
some defined the best discovery protocol

195
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:25,880
in order to support their or LTS this is

196
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:29,850
an internal tracker service butter for

197
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,760
awareness of other growers as a little a

198
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:40,560
little different from the two national

199
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:44,150
attract service the different aids of

200
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:47,880
the summer protocol service you can

201
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:52,020
support wireless holidays to fill share

202
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:58,020
you because the main the main function

203
00:16:52,020 --> 00:17:13,230
of the so to me friendship of the

204
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:15,329
Wurlitzer hard disk is because the me

205
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:21,620
friendship of the wireless holidays is

206
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:21,619
supported by so few genuine foreign area

207
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:30,510
the assemble protocol is also a very

208
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:35,900
important vulnerability meaning front

209
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:38,430
although rarely hard disk so second not

210
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:42,470
so cheap we need

211
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:49,620
to find out the open parts and service

212
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:53,750
programs the auger is serosal

213
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:58,290
of who each service and the surly leaks

214
00:17:53,750 --> 00:18:02,010
between them so we can better understand

215
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:08,730
of the really shape it will into our

216
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:09,420
laser disk disk software in the fourth

217
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:14,090
class

218
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:18,090
we need to send out the individual

219
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:23,220
authority out date and the water medium

220
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:26,030
of the series of programs and then in

221
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:30,770
the end we need a tool either a

222
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,770
vulnerability attract tooth

223
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:42,360
first we log into the web rebel rebel

224
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:47,040
level background although wireless had a

225
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:51,270
disk they opened the SSH operation has

226
00:18:47,040 --> 00:19:00,750
able us to better explain to own

227
00:18:51,270 --> 00:19:05,550
abilities through the part as through

228
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:08,610
the part scanning tools vacated the open

229
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:12,300
parts and the service of the various

230
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:19,979
qualities as a shown in the figure of

231
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:26,000
all the device device open up some parts

232
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,000
and the series says are more vulnerable

233
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:41,340
open service high summer asaba service

234
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:45,479
web servers LP service and the UPnP

235
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:50,409
Saurus some service as a few sharing

236
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:56,440
protocol and happy service as

237
00:19:50,410 --> 00:20:03,550
Apple Network protocol service and the

238
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:08,290
UPnP is a plug-and-play series as far as

239
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:14,340
per you water ability on the Samba fill

240
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:14,340
Transfer Protocol and the UPnP protocol

241
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:29,160
in this part there are four parts for

242
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:33,100
vulnerability menu the process of

243
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:46,420
constructing oil T vulnerability orders

244
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:50,709
is mainly divided into four tabs the

245
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:54,070
first part of is the other of who ginger

246
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,770
ginger awfully sensitive functions so

247
00:20:54,070 --> 00:21:00,879
rise to drink coffee member cokie and

248
00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:05,110
the similar versions can cause paranoia

249
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:11,410
or flow the second part is the to

250
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:15,719
audience as a important input part of

251
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:19,480
the function if there is a function is a

252
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:23,080
ginger to overflow and there is a

253
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:26,530
solution where the user can control

254
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:33,820
input so in the one owner ability can be

255
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:37,870
explained the third part is a two digit

256
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:41,950
to whether the karlon two programs as

257
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:50,949
the open source code ourselves a later

258
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:58,960
version is self-aware and memo throat a

259
00:21:50,950 --> 00:22:04,059
problem the last third part is to check

260
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:10,649
whether the current programs has a local

261
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:19,330
a local one ability to change the flower

262
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:22,718
of a fraction so we can do we will to

263
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:28,449
send my protocol and the see if they are

264
00:22:22,719 --> 00:22:34,269
financially 70 Isis with eight first we

265
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:42,009
log into the original system ssh-2 wheel

266
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:45,969
to Semba service fields from the fields

267
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:50,049
to share parts of the Sanwa service as a

268
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:56,289
concern constant under the whisker is

269
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:59,580
alone to us access we can see that the

270
00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:14,710
current version of Samba protocol is

271
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:19,360
version 3 on silk on a 20 firm because

272
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:24,809
how confident about a summer Werner

273
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:28,209
ability in crowd was research I want to

274
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:33,399
readily if there is a history or

275
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:37,380
nobility in this version first I look at

276
00:23:33,399 --> 00:23:43,209
the current past few of the accessory

277
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:47,230
vulnerability and in the future to the

278
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:52,299
Saline in the past year and then but

279
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:57,090
this coming the smbd demo of the summer

280
00:23:52,299 --> 00:24:01,240
protocol as on that the current approach

281
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:06,990
grant does not include include argument

282
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:20,110
of the suing so this is how we'll have a

283
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:23,770
protocol for vulnerability when they use

284
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:28,529
the Samba protocol to upload those files

285
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:31,658
to the share parts of the together fuel

286
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:35,440
because the function does another few

287
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:40,360
filters between the current called the

288
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:50,679
function to exist the tools to similar

289
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:55,029
model function suddenly any colder in

290
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:58,659
the elf ASO fields will be is part under

291
00:24:55,029 --> 00:25:01,919
a secure the intro and in in the model

292
00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:06,159
friendship subversion has the same

293
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:13,390
format as a Samba native module

294
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:18,760
furnishing so as no people named

295
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:23,880
functions as a refresher the function is

296
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:23,879
to decide you enter a people name

297
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:38,460
if the people name of 3 is an odd filter

298
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:41,620
in the wanna honorable versions then the

299
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:49,420
parameter given name will be passed to

300
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:52,959
Sandberg probe model furniture because

301
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:58,170
the semi pro model furniture causes the

302
00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:01,690
to Samba loader loader model function

303
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:07,470
the people names dream will be loaded as

304
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:11,080
a path when Carter young whether the

305
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:13,720
first regime of a model name the

306
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:21,280
function will come to the floor of

307
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:25,510
another unit of variance the parameter

308
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:30,550
given name as the user either pass to as

part 2 as address form a tofu Samba in

310
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:45,850
the model and then secure that the as a

311
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:55,209
part of version which is secured as part

312
00:26:45,850 --> 00:27:02,770
functions upload a so field theory Oh

313
00:26:55,210 --> 00:27:10,960
without in the result in the exciting a

314
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:16,960
Nicole nestled on the Neva is my college

315
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:20,310
to talk no idea continually introduce

316
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,620
how to use this more abilities for a

317
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:26,980
complete attack this vulnerability

318
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:30,159
cannot cause a living in fact before

319
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,090
believe time shows a lot of power of

320
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,180
this very storage twice

321
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,490
according to the previous introduction

322
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:41,880
some that protocol will not be taken

323
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:45,370
we use the user tool pretty

324
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:52,029
preconditions the first one is that the

325
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:56,969
device should be exercised remotely the

326
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:59,950
second one is some lines at the shared

327
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:04,929
directory pass off the device to the P

328
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:08,799
known however on the other device the

329
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:12,330
shared directory path is stable so the

330
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:18,340
exploitation is easy to easy to employ

331
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:21,370
implement the completed hike process

332
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:26,408
consists of a serious steps the first

333
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:30,270
step is to find a device in the Wi-Fi

334
00:28:26,409 --> 00:28:33,460
environment the second step is to

335
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:37,840
explore a trigger that will be tender is

336
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:43,140
fight the third step is to control the

337
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:47,309
device and maybe in Chapter crafts

338
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:47,309
program program in it

339
00:28:49,350 --> 00:29:00,158
in the first step we can use the SSDP

340
00:28:54,970 --> 00:29:07,000
device discovery protocol to start this

341
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:12,580
type of Avernus story to us this process

342
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:17,559
includes three contents first initialize

343
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:21,610
the object and parameters then gather

344
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,830
the IP and a variety of the current

345
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:27,479
device

346
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:33,029
notice that the UID is caused by adding

347
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:38,700
four zero things that is zero zero zero

348
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:38,700
to the rise of them and amazed a pass

349
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:46,080
runs the message processing through out

350
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:51,810
of a precise UDP and TCP Messi's

351
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:56,050
separately finally use

352
00:29:51,810 --> 00:30:20,169
select a model to search the Acela TV

353
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:29,320
message to discover the device the app

354
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:40,320
load is a sole fell through some bad

355
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:40,320
protocol to use this vulnerability and

356
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:48,030
then we can to run the exploitation

357
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:48,030
program

358
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:59,120
so felt to the shared directory of the

359
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:02,210
various aha discs through the function

360
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:08,169
of Samba vertical and now secured this

361
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:11,900
operation in the load payload function

362
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:16,040
there's certain third function then we

363
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:21,020
find this device we can get the IP of

364
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:29,570
the device and finally shared fair pass

365
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:32,950
information then they when the youth

366
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:37,280
protection is successful

367
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:42,590
it'll cause the server to open the shell

368
00:31:37,280 --> 00:32:04,480
program under a shell vo listen on the

369
00:31:42,590 --> 00:32:08,889
local part in this graph we can say that

370
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:16,310
the way when the religion program is

371
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:20,420
successful Tel Aviv show this first it

372
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:27,800
can search devices in the Wi-Fi

373
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:35,300
environment and find AP that is today's

374
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:40,310
this and find the pass and the upload

375
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:46,700
felt was to disperse this pass and open

376
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:50,740
a shop then runner-runner ID program to

377
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:50,740
show its route with shell

378
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:07,400
in all process we can say just to

379
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:12,540
covering the this type of device is a

380
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:16,200
critical step during the attack and I

381
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:20,760
have a finished finished automated -

382
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:24,300
that can see need for the device in the

383
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:28,970
Wi-Fi environment its operation in

384
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:33,840
principle for the Custer the search

385
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:38,610
packet in the 11-year Mendoza device

386
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,370
discovery protocol and with it is a I

387
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:46,729
think from the promotion of all network

388
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:50,070
segment in the environment and then

389
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:53,550
compare the return information there is

390
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:58,409
a finger finger print of the IOT device

391
00:33:53,550 --> 00:34:06,649
devices that is a very start storage

392
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:11,480
device when its neighbors the out is a

393
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:15,440
specific device fingerprint of this

394
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,960
storage device and it will fill the

395
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:24,210
corresponding IP and a passel of shared

396
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:39,179
cells then perform automated will

397
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:41,639
ability attack wins over various the

398
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:46,679
hard disk is connected to the public

399
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:50,699
coughing I thought after launching the

400
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:57,210
attack to the hacker can perform other

401
00:34:50,699 --> 00:35:02,390
operations through this portal the

402
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:05,940
attacker can continue to implant the

403
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:11,129
children and when the user connected the

404
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:14,090
device to the PC via USB the piece a

405
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,090
will also be if

406
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:25,759
and the attacker can also use this

407
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:29,880
device as an access point to collect

408
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:34,470
other information about the device such

409
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:42,030
as my cries all modify the hosts

410
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:46,709
information to fake a website where

411
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:49,830
affirmed it is ideas into crime to

412
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:53,880
choose other they are another kind of

413
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:59,700
lead disclosed maybe I will

414
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:07,590
podium of the rehab maybe a nice autumn

415
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:10,230
L to mess and through this

416
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:14,660
security analysis and mobility research

417
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:20,150
of various hardisk

418
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:26,759
said about the security of many

419
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:30,090
questions about the IOT security in the

420
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:34,530
similar embodied values hard drive

421
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:38,580
system some vendors can use open source

422
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:41,520
third-party code to can gather computer

423
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:49,049
tools and they don't update security

424
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:59,910
patches attending medical this one of

425
00:36:49,050 --> 00:37:02,760
EDS course many high-risk problems but

426
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:07,440
if you guys have any questions you can

427
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:15,330
contact my colleague info by the you

428
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:16,450
know dries you out a 3600 so that's it

429
