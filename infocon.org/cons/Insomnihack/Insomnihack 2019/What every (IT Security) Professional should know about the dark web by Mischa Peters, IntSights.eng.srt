00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:19,140
hello everybody good afternoon

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:21,630
as I was already introduced I'm Misha

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,650
Peters I'm responsible for everything

5
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:28,948
technical at incites anemia from a

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,460
pre-sales perspective and so before we

7
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:36,210
start and I cannot see everybody because

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:41,430
of nice bright lights who knows what the

9
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:44,659
dark web is all right cool who's been oh

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,970
now we can who's been on the dark web

11
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:55,589
all right cool who is running a relay

12
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:59,909
note okay who's running an exit note two

13
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:03,809
three all right cool awesome just to to

14
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:05,970
understand where the knowledge is so

15
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:08,820
indeed my talk is about what you should

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,470
know about the dark web because

17
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,270
primarily there's a lot of information

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,000
that you see on the news these days

19
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:18,600
about the dark web but there's a lot

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,520
more on there so that's what I would

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,589
like to discuss and on the end there's a

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,530
couple of things that I can show you

23
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,170
what we do as insights to help you find

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:31,890
all the things that you need to know

25
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:33,420
because you cannot really defend if you

26
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,330
don't know what's coming your way right

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,550
if you don't know what's what's

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,330
targeting you if you're in someone's

29
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:43,229
 list

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,270
excuse my french then you have no idea

31
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:47,100
who you're defending against you can of

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,320
course have your firewall and it's and

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,119
it's doing its thing but there's more

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:56,850
than that that could potentially harm

35
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:59,610
your your your organization so just to

36
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:01,860
then come back to the basis of it all

37
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:03,630
and have a dish definition of what the

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,750
clear deep and dark web is so that we're

39
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,470
all on the same page for us or as the

40
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,849
market has defined it

41
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:14,099
everything clear web is is pretty much

42
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:16,048
or what people call what you can find

43
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:18,290
with Google or your search engine of

44
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:21,060
preference doctor go start page whatever

45
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,120
but you don't need specific protocols

46
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,500
besides HTTP

47
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,090
for that you don't need specific

48
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,430
credentials in order to gain access to

49
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,830
those sources so that's what's

50
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,310
considered the clear web so things like

51
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:36,940
social media to an extent new sites and

52
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:39,940
so on basement sites then there's a big

53
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,010
part that is classified as deep web and

54
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,109
the deep web part is pretty much

55
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,599
everything where you need user name and

56
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,370
password for so your gmail account if

57
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,099
you have one and that's already

58
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,079
considered Deep Web and then there's a

59
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:54,940
small portion below that that's

60
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,430
considered the dark web and you need a

61
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,340
specific protocol for that so either it

62
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,230
be tour or ITP or things like that in

63
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,450
order to gain access to these sources

64
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,819
you still might need credentials in

65
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,768
order to gain access but initially you

66
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,560
need a separate browser in this case in

67
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:14,530
order to access those sources so that's

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,959
a little bit on the definition side now

69
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,480
the other thing as soon as you start

70
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,299
talking about dark web it has a pretty

71
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:26,380
bad reputation maybe not here but the

72
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:28,169
general public so to say considers the

73
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:31,329
dark web to be a bad thing

74
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:33,720
and a lot of people agree that it should

75
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,030
just disappear it should be shut down

76
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,549
and then especially if you consider some

77
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:41,799
of the statistics on on tour for example

78
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:44,200
and there's there's a lot of different

79
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:48,489
sources out there there's of course I'm

80
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,410
some peeks I'm Dutch the Dutch a police

81
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,260
force is very good in bringing down some

82
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:55,540
market places and which for us as a

83
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,910
company sometimes not a good thing but

84
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,209
anyway and sources come in sources go

85
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:06,579
but if you then look at what the general

86
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:09,639
public has to say about cyber criminals

87
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:12,430
is that it's also for most people the

88
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:14,290
primary concern and and what that

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,410
actually means and what the definition

90
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,529
of that is that can also always be

91
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:23,470
debated right but for a lot of people

92
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:25,750
dark web it's unknown people don't know

93
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:28,870
what's going on there we need to have it

94
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,410
gone and cyber criminals are popping up

95
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:32,320
everywhere

96
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:34,600
it's a rampant problem so that's where

97
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,639
we want to do something

98
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:41,979
now the thing is who's on Twitter really

99
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,650
okay more so there's there's a really

100
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:47,409
cool account called Zen zoo cyber and

101
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:50,799
they have some really nice quotes at

102
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,509
least I find them funny is that your

103
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,729
adversary does not wait for you to

104
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:56,080
finish patching which is true right it

105
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:58,330
doesn't really matter what's going on

106
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,580
what you're doing internally they

107
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,530
they're not gonna listen to your project

108
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,698
or your timeline or your priorities it's

109
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:09,070
if there's a hole they'll find it also

110
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,560
the enemy does not check your risk

111
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:16,180
register prior to attacking so they're

112
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:19,330
not gonna see and look at Hecker one for

113
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:22,289
example What's in scope of the bug

114
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:26,229
bounty that's out there no one cares

115
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:28,210
and then the last one management will

116
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,620
not provide additional budget based on

117
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,229
ancient quotes on PowerPoint

118
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,960
presentations which is also true right

119
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:38,258
if you want to convince your management

120
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,729
about any type of investment that needs

121
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:41,650
to be done doesn't really matter what

122
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,050
you need to come with reasons why that

123
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:46,989
it's a good thing instead of because I

124
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:50,110
wanted that's never a good thing people

125
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,990
don't react to that well so what's at

126
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,400
stake a lot of different things and

127
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,949
there's a lot of different things that

128
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,870
you can already cover with the usual

129
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:00,520
suspect from a security perspective but

130
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,199
as long as you know what's coming your

131
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:08,169
way you can be better protected as I

132
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:10,690
showed before so software exploits is a

133
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,669
problem as soon as you see that you have

134
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,699
a certain software running either

135
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:18,099
external internal there's an exploit on

136
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,229
it it's actively being used or being

137
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:23,380
targeted and you know about it then you

138
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:26,800
can prioritize based your patching based

139
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:28,750
on that data leakage for a lot of

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,680
companies especially now in Europe gdpr

141
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:34,780
hooray it's it's a big problem so the

142
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,820
days that you can say I didn't know that

143
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,559
that data was out there aren't no longer

144
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,630
there they are there over you you need

145
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,610
to know what's going on instead of

146
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:44,289
someone else telling you hey my credit

147
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,889
card number is now there or my user

148
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:47,780
account is now there

149
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:51,860
and so that's also one of the things

150
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:54,020
that's that's important brand reputation

151
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:56,060
and impersonation is becoming a more

152
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,210
more of a problem not only from a

153
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:00,979
sentiment side of things so are talking

154
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,810
are people talking on Twitter bad about

155
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:07,099
my brand that's a whole different thing

156
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,620
but also from a perspective is there a

157
00:07:07,099 --> 00:07:13,099
fake social media accounts that imitates

158
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,349
my brands and are there now getting

159
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,180
access to user information or customer

160
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:18,949
information or there's a mobile

161
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:22,460
application that's in one of the

162
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,689
application stores that is not ours but

163
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,419
it looks like ours and people are

164
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:30,050
downloading it who can remember the the

165
00:07:26,419 --> 00:07:33,919
fake what's up application that was

166
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:38,389
there in I think the Google store two

167
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:41,089
years ago two years ago there was a fake

168
00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:44,870
whatsapp application and I think it was

169
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:47,659
based on on a Unicode name and it was

170
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,210
downloaded 1 million times before it was

171
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:53,719
shut down so if you have the ability to

172
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:56,448
have an application that looks like HSBC

173
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,370
Bank or whatever Bank and you download

174
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,560
it or you're getting an email saying hey

175
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:02,539
we have an update and you're being

176
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,639
redirected to an underground application

177
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,589
store you download it you install it and

178
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,599
then all of a sudden all your data and

179
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:10,849
every single keystroke is now captured

180
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:12,560
and being sent elsewhere so it's a big

181
00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:14,620
problem and if you don't know about it

182
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,740
you cannot protect against it

183
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:21,050
phishing not only from our customers

184
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:24,349
perspective so the actual entity that we

185
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:27,800
that we protect but also their customers

186
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:29,990
or their their vendors or partners that

187
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,909
are being targeted by by phishing more

188
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,060
and more and it's becoming more of a

189
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:37,279
rampant problem than it already was and

190
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:39,049
of course also executive members I'm not

191
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,630
going through the whole list although I

192
00:08:39,049 --> 00:08:42,769
almost did but supply chain attacks we

193
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:46,300
see that also from a phishing

194
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:49,820
perspective and we seeing more and more

195
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:53,420
executives being targeted via social

196
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,220
media or targeted directly so that's all

197
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,709
at stake and that's also one of the

198
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:59,300
things that you can get from doing any

199
00:08:57,709 --> 00:09:04,130
type of monitoring on the

200
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:08,510
for example so what do we know about the

201
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:10,970
dark web what is actually being sold or

202
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,470
what type of stuff can you get on the

203
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:17,330
dark web and that's a question for you

204
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:22,450
so you can just shout it if you want or

205
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:24,950
not then I'll show you not a problem

206
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,240
because usually and it actually works

207
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:27,620
quite well I've done this talk now a

208
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,790
couple of times and every time I ask

209
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:32,750
this question the first thing that I

210
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,459
always hear weapons right did the

211
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:36,200
Association a lot of people have with

212
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,760
the dark web is all the illegal stuff

213
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,580
that you can buy and one of the illegal

214
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,180
things that you can buy are weapons the

215
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:49,190
other thing is of course drugs right who

216
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:51,260
had that yes a lot of you good then the

217
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:53,270
other thing is of course all the other

218
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:55,250
stuff that you might want to have an own

219
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:57,530
or you think it's cool to have one which

220
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,590
is a submarine for example or tank or a

221
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,720
max Mac Mac twin mig-21 or whatever it

222
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:06,890
is all these things you can probably buy

223
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:09,890
on the dark web but that's not really

224
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:11,810
why we as in sites are actually

225
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:13,520
monitoring the dark web for you because

226
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,300
we're not really interested in that part

227
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:19,430
of the world and also from an attackers

228
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:23,420
perspective it's also not the thing that

229
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:25,900
they think is most important what for an

230
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,819
attacker is most important is anonymity

231
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,949
so that they can just do whatever the

232
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,950
hell they want without being known

233
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:37,580
without being able to to track and just

234
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:40,310
for the people that don't know what dark

235
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:43,460
web or tor is for that matter very brief

236
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:46,430
overview it's basically a network of

237
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:48,740
proxies so you enter the tor network in

238
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,420
an entry node you're being bounced

239
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,210
around different proxies and then you

240
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,280
end up on an exit node and then the exit

241
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:57,680
node has no idea what your IP address

242
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,329
what what your IP address was all the

243
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,609
way at the beginning so you could

244
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,980
potentially be quite anonymous if you're

245
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,510
also serving the normal web and a lot of

246
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,970
people do that these days for example if

247
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:09,290
you wanted my plane ticket and you're

248
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,490
going through your normal browser and

249
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,069
you have all your cookies there the

250
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,110
price will be X and if you go if you

251
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,180
your cookies for example the price might

252
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:19,040
be something completely different so it

253
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,880
can also have a nice benefit effect if

254
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,219
you want to save some money on that way

255
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:29,720
but the whole idea behind it is

256
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:32,980
anonymity and also because of that you

257
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:36,080
can pretty much be anybody you want on

258
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,210
the dark web all the way in the

259
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:42,380
beginning the internet when it came

260
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:44,120
people said well you never know if who's

261
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,280
being a dog on the internet right you

262
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,760
could always be pretending to be someone

263
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:51,410
else now those days are almost gone as

264
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,540
soon as you're at home or behind your

265
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:54,980
phone people know who you are every

266
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,990
single moment of the time they know

267
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:59,600
where you are where you live who you are

268
00:11:56,990 --> 00:12:01,400
because if there's a problem they have

269
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:05,600
to talk to law enforcement in order to

270
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,140
say okay this person did this but on the

271
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,750
dark web or tour or any other type of

272
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,280
network you can still be whoever you

273
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:16,520
want so you can be Darth Vader if you

274
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,290
want it's all very anonymous and you

275
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,810
have never you actually never know who

276
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:23,870
you're who you're dealing with

277
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:26,209
and that then also sparks the problem

278
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:28,130
with the dark web and also the

279
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:30,410
association that people have with that

280
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,780
is that it's a criminal help it's a

281
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:35,390
criminal activity hub so you can rent a

282
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:40,220
hacker and you can you can look for an

283
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:42,800
insider so any type of criminal activity

284
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,430
you probably want to do you can find

285
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,859
someone that will do it on the dark web

286
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,469
now that's all the bad stuff there's

287
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,120
also some good things with the dark web

288
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,030
and it's also one of the things that I

289
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,830
think it should not go away because the

290
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,880
other thing that it can also allow you

291
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:05,060
to do is if you're in a regime where you

292
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,280
beat anonymity and there's sensor and

293
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:09,439
anything like that then tor or tour

294
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,120
light networks can provide you a way to

295
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,480
communicate with the outside world

296
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,250
without being impacted on your freedom

297
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,020
for example so there's a lot of activist

298
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,940
groups there and there's a lot of

299
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,790
sources for journalists to dump

300
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:26,449
information on anonymous sites

301
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:29,870
all post Wikipedia our wiki WikiLeaks

302
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:32,240
type services so there's also some good

303
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:36,709
things there it's not all bad

304
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,019
it's the minority but still so we've

305
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:43,130
done this what is being sold on the dark

306
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:46,220
web the weapons the drugs and the tanks

307
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:48,350
but what else is there what else is

308
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,940
there that you need to know about so

309
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,500
that you can protect your environment

310
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,089
that you can protect your organization

311
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,889
your employees and your infrastructure

312
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:59,060
because that's what it's pretty much all

313
00:13:54,889 --> 00:14:01,579
about obvious one its credit cards right

314
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:04,510
credit cards are being sold and mass

315
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:08,899
from different banks different vendors

316
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:11,480
sometimes even with money on there we

317
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,160
for every single financial institution

318
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,470
that is our customer or that we do an

319
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,100
evaluation with we will always find

320
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:21,290
credit cards that are being sold or

321
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,050
credit cards that are being dumped so

322
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,240
some sources or some forums are just

323
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:29,269
there for where people can just dump

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,709
credit cards you can just get them start

325
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:35,149
using them so that that's a big problem

326
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:37,069
so the way that you can use this

327
00:14:35,149 --> 00:14:39,740
information is that if you know that

328
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:43,069
that is happening one of the things that

329
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:45,589
we can provide as insights is we have

330
00:14:43,069 --> 00:14:47,959
analysts available that can also do all

331
00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:49,610
sorts of additional services buy and not

332
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,518
only notifying you that this is

333
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:54,589
happening but we can also help you deal

334
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,910
with the problem right so one of the

335
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:59,750
things that you might want to know about

336
00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,510
this is let's say it's I mentioned HSBC

337
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:04,910
already just as an example let's say

338
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:08,630
we've identified credit card numbers of

339
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,459
HSBC of you as a customer so one of the

340
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,170
things that you will then see is a list

341
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:15,109
of credit cards that says okay these are

342
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,120
all HSBC premium credit cards prepaid

343
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,740
credit cards so one of the things that

344
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,839
we can do is we can actually go to the

345
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,149
seller and say okay give us a sample of

346
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,279
those credit cards so that our customer

347
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:27,800
can actually validate if these credit

348
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,319
cards are theirs and if they're there as

349
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:32,240
we can also help our customer to buy the

350
00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:34,430
credit cards usually they're not that

351
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,390
expensive but then at least you have the

352
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,400
numbers and

353
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,090
our customer can destroy them so that

354
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,650
they cannot harm them even more so

355
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,640
that's one of the it's a very simple

356
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:48,920
thing but it can be very very effective

357
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:51,680
another thing that you will find on the

358
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,510
dark web is Dietl services we had a lot

359
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,130
of web stressors that were also

360
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:58,280
available in the clear web that you can

361
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:00,560
test your website a lot of these got

362
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,660
taken down the other day but they're

363
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,209
still services and botnets that are

364
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:07,040
being used to run these services and

365
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:10,730
then you end up with a website like this

366
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:15,620
and it's no longer available so and that

367
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:18,740
can happen in in two different ways one

368
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:20,930
is that these services are being sold of

369
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:23,630
course but what can also happen is that

370
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:26,630
we can identify IP addresses or domains

371
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:29,420
that are part of a list that are being

372
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:32,150
attacked or that will be attacked for

373
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:34,250
however the reason is can be on a target

374
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:36,290
list for example so that if you know

375
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,480
that your domain or that your IP address

376
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,699
is on that list you might want to put

377
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,670
some things in place already to consume

378
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,820
the DDoS that you might get simple

379
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:49,760
things but very effective and other

380
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,250
things are being sold our accounts so

381
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:55,910
similar to credit-card numbers but also

382
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,950
just bank account numbers that even can

383
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,699
be filled with money that you can buy

384
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:03,830
for minimal amount of money and so if we

385
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,510
identify those again you can close those

386
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:09,530
accounts so that they can no longer do

387
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:12,859
any damage to the organization other

388
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,040
things of course are documents and we

389
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:17,448
don't see this very often not when

390
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,629
they're being sold but you're usually

391
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:22,250
being dumped and one of the things that

392
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,410
we can do based on the information that

393
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,060
we have of our clients is actually look

394
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:28,880
for documents that have their their

395
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,409
company name in theirs may be brands may

396
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,930
be different product names or product

397
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:35,660
codes may be there's lights on some

398
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:38,540
internal secret don't your eyes only for

399
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:40,460
example these type of phrases so that we

400
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:42,170
can identify those or someone can just

401
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,850
say hey I've got a bunch of internal

402
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:47,180
documentation or internal email

403
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:50,480
conversations of company XYZ here it is

404
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,880
or you can buy this

405
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,280
one of the more interesting things that

406
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,110
we can also see or that you can also

407
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,680
find on on the dark web are hacking

408
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:04,129
tutorials for example this was I think

409
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:07,040
for for free flight upgrades for example

410
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:09,650
but it can also be how you can make free

411
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,590
calls with a prepaid cards or how you

412
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:14,840
can use different coupon codes to enable

413
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,929
certain services or whatever the

414
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,439
tutorial might be that could harm an

415
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:23,090
organization and then of course more the

416
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,240
obvious things is that if you want to

417
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:28,669
launch any type of attack from a from a

418
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,440
more phishing or malware type campaign

419
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:32,630
you need also an infrastructure for that

420
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,060
you need a website you might need some

421
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,280
some email capabilities and these are

422
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,770
being sold on the web you don't need any

423
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,629
knowledge these days to just launch an

424
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:44,900
attack or launch and malware campaign

425
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:47,920
against an organization it's all very

426
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:51,290
cheap also D doses it's very cheap and

427
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,300
then the more interesting parts are when

428
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,460
people are looking for insiders in

429
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:58,120
organization so this is one of the ways

430
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,590
that Anacin match lee was being targeted

431
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,370
someone was looking for an insider in

432
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:07,340
that organization for certain access and

433
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:08,810
that happens on on a by regular basis

434
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,480
where people are going hey I'm looking

435
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,429
for an insider in Bank of America or an

436
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,050
insider in BMW or whatever the

437
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:18,440
organization might be for whatever the

438
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:21,169
purpose so those are some of the things

439
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,090
that you can then identifying that you

440
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:26,060
can seen that is also being offered and

441
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:29,659
sold on the dark web and of course

442
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:32,570
hacking servers in general so hey I need

443
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,400
this website to be taken down or I'm

444
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:37,700
interested in credentials of that

445
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,830
specific organization so there's a lot

446
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:41,960
of things that that are a lot of

447
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:45,320
services that people offer in regards to

448
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,630
that and one of the things that we also

449
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:49,909
do is not just analyze this on a

450
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,010
continuous basis as insights we also

451
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:54,920
engage with threat actors that we've

452
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:57,500
identified so the other day on on dream

453
00:19:54,920 --> 00:20:00,020
market we got in contact with a threat

454
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,520
actor it was the by the time when when

455
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:04,500
there was a lot of new credentials

456
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,060
Angelique's being dumped a collection

457
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,130
number one through five if people

458
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:10,649
remember millions and millions or

459
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,840
billions in of different credentials but

460
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:16,410
at that same time there are also other

461
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,050
credential or other credentials being

462
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,380
released or being offered for sale and

463
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,510
we've been able to identify very unique

464
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,950
credentials through a threat actor that

465
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,740
we engage with and we could actually

466
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,510
validate that this was patient number

467
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,700
zero for example so this was actually

468
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:35,400
the person that got those credentials of

469
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,430
these organizations so it's not only

470
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,050
that we look at a data that is on the

471
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:42,450
dark web but we actually engage with

472
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:48,389
threat actors if we see that there's

473
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:51,180
data tu-tu-tu-tu-tu-tu get because you

474
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:52,490
cannot defend what you cannot see in a

475
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:54,810
nutshell

476
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,030
so this is pretty much all the things

477
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:59,520
that from from a high-level perspective

478
00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:02,399
all the things that beyond the drugs and

479
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,230
the weapons and and the guns that you

480
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,540
can see on the dark web and how that can

481
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,150
be useful so what I now want to show you

482
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:11,340
is how that actually looks like in our

483
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,930
in our platform in our dashboard and if

484
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:14,790
you want to know more about it we're

485
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,710
here in the hole we can run you through

486
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,710
demo and show you all the bells and

487
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,070
whistles but the idea behind insights as

488
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,590
a platform is that we cover part of the

489
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:27,659
let's say that the supply chain from

490
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,629
motive there's not much we can do or

491
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:32,730
intent if it's there they will find a

492
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:34,350
way to actually attack so one of the

493
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,680
things that we want to do and want to

494
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:39,149
make visible is actually the targeting

495
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:41,280
development infrastructure and

496
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:43,770
reconnaissance and capture that and make

497
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,550
you aware of all these things and all

498
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:51,240
these steps and the way that we do that

499
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,850
is we have a service that we offer where

500
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:57,120
we provide an early warning system and

501
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:59,219
advanced visibility of relevant external

502
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,870
threats the market calls that cyber

503
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:03,030
threat intelligence or digital risk

504
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:05,850
protection these days or you can also

505
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,639
call this dark web monitoring however

506
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,980
you want to define that or slice it it's

507
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,560
all comes down to identifying relevant

508
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,470
threats for your organization

509
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,360
that's the key and we not only want to

510
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,980
inform you about it but we also want to

511
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,610
give you the means of actually mitigate

512
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,890
them

513
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,260
so remediate against those type of

514
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:27,630
threats and also give you all the tools

515
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,170
and capabilities to automate that whole

516
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:32,760
process if you want to sow beyond all

517
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,710
the dark web stuff there's some other

518
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:37,640
things that we can also do because it is

519
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:40,410
a big problem is identify any type of

520
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:42,990
domain that looks like the domains that

521
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,610
you own right you have your your website

522
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,640
you have your email you might have a

523
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,860
bunch of Park domains people can look at

524
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,630
those do some type of squatting change a

525
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,780
couple of characters around maybe some

526
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:56,850
frequent typos register these domains

527
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,710
and then use them for a phishing

528
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,469
campaign against your organization or

529
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,870
what we see more and more is actually

530
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,820
your peripheral ecosystem so your

531
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:07,709
vendors your partner's your customers

532
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,649
that are being targeted from a phishing

533
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:13,500
perspective but in this case what we can

534
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,420
do is identify that we can show you hey

535
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,280
there's now a domain there's anime a

536
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:19,860
mixed record for it there's a website

537
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,770
potentially behind it and also give you

538
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,439
the button here that says remediate you

539
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,180
can press it and then we will go to the

540
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,510
domain registrar to actually take that

541
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:33,960
domain down for you and at the same time

542
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:36,090
we can also turn this into a feed so any

543
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,450
type of i/o see any type of indicator of

544
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,280
compromise so IP address URL domain file

545
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,130
hash that we can enter identify

546
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,990
targeting your organization we can then

547
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:48,360
turn that into a feat and you can use

548
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:52,100
that internally to feed your firewall or

549
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:55,080
your sim or office 365 if you use that

550
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,719
or wherever it makes sense to to block

551
00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:01,080
certain traffic to and from those

552
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:03,480
domains one of the things that we can

553
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,210
also identify of course is credential

554
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,150
leaks we go way beyond have I been

555
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:11,040
pawned and we identify them based on a

556
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,470
domain so we don't need a list of all

557
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,300
your email addresses and then we try we

558
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:19,260
try that but we just use your domains to

559
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,840
see what sticks and yes there's always

560
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,090
the LinkedIn database every single

561
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,580
evaluation that we do we get LinkedIn

562
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,820
credentials there

563
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,590
and yes still we have customs that go oh

564
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:32,149
yeah that was actually quite useful we

565
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:35,600
still had two accounts using the same

566
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:39,290
username and password combination that

567
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,820
was in 2016 so come on anyway but people

568
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,230
are lazy with their passwords right who

569
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:46,040
has changed our LinkedIn password in the

570
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:48,950
last year okay

571
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:53,510
1020 people how many people in the room

572
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,170
roughly how many are on LinkedIn who is

573
00:24:53,510 --> 00:25:01,910
on LinkedIn

574
00:24:54,170 --> 00:25:04,280
good question a lot more so sometimes

575
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:05,930
you do need to to also change your your

576
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,940
password it's on our regular basis so

577
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:12,650
that you're not gonna be pwned by

578
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:14,510
someone and then related to some of the

579
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,480
examples that I showed you accounts

580
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:21,110
being for sale and that can be from any

581
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,960
service that you're using can be this is

582
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,850
actually no there's no screenshot of a

583
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:31,360
real customer but we also see that when

584
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:34,010
we have a customer that has any type of

585
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:37,310
user base or counts or services that

586
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,620
they provide that this pops up so then

587
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:42,020
we can again the name of the customer

588
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,169
engage with the threat actor show us a

589
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,840
sample we can also buy them and you just

590
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:49,700
destroy those accounts or or inform the

591
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,919
user of those accounts okay we're gonna

592
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:54,980
change your your your number or your

593
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:59,330
your login or whatever the the follow up

594
00:25:54,980 --> 00:26:01,460
might be hacker tutorials that we can

595
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:03,620
identify in pretty much any type of

596
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:08,590
language so either the Arabic Russian

597
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:12,679
Chinese Japanese whatever French Italian

598
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:14,600
we can identify that for you so it's not

599
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:19,490
only English language that we that we

600
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:22,699
cover and as I mentioned credit cards

601
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:26,090
it's it's for if you have credit cards

602
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:29,200
it's a big problem so then we can just

603
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:32,330
identify those again we can talk to you

604
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,490
the threat actor get a sample buy them

605
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,720
and you destroy them and you inform the

606
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,920
customers hey you're now gonna have a

607
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,080
new credit card number here's your new

608
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,149
credit cards

609
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:43,370
today I actually got an email from from

610
00:26:41,149 --> 00:26:46,010
our intelligence group where we've now

611
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:50,080
also engaged with another threat actor

612
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:53,600
in regards to credentials from two major

613
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:56,270
companies that people had and it was not

614
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,490
only it was the the Israeli version of

615
00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:00,230
uber it's called get and it didn't have

616
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:03,700
customer information in there but it had

617
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:06,409
all their drivers out of Russia in there

618
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,850
so it had their their names their phone

619
00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:10,130
number their driver's license their

620
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:11,629
license plate so the data that is being

621
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:14,450
offered and being sold is quite

622
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:16,220
sensitive so that's we also want to make

623
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,470
our customers aware say hey this is this

624
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,020
is going on

625
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:24,409
that was actually my talk I'm usually

626
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,629
very happy if people ask me questions

627
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:42,190
just to get some interaction going if

628
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:47,169
there's any questions let me know yes hi

629
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:52,010
you say twice about hacking tutorials

630
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:55,299
easy problem is it so is that kind of

631
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:59,090
security through obscurity or or what

632
00:27:55,299 --> 00:28:02,960
why is it a problem it's usually a

633
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:05,149
financial problem so one of the one of

634
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:08,899
our customers is a large mobile operator

635
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:11,270
and we've been able to identify a

636
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:12,139
tutorial round I think it was prepaid

637
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:15,049
it's been a while

638
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:18,230
around prepaid cards and how to to use

639
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:21,350
them to extend or or to add free money

640
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:23,360
on those cards so it's it's it then

641
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:26,719
doesn't really become a security problem

642
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,629
per se but more of a financial risk and

643
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,950
a fraud problem you're absolutely right

644
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:42,169
[Music]

645
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:44,450
anybody else a question was how do you

646
00:28:42,169 --> 00:28:46,460
get that information like you purchase

647
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,169
for all this stuff to be able to get

648
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,440
that information and provide it to the

649
00:28:48,169 --> 00:28:52,500
company or in in general or in general

650
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,920
yeah so

651
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:59,850
in general good question in general what

652
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:04,170
we do is we gain access to these sources

653
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:06,149
ourselves so we have a whole team with

654
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,940
their only purpose in life is to

655
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,650
identify new sources directly deep or

656
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:13,580
dark doesn't really matter and gain

657
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,310
access to those sources so either

658
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,500
getting an introduction by someone

659
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:21,840
maintaining an avatar being able to

660
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,550
continuously collect data because that's

661
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,010
that's pretty much the essence of our of

662
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:29,580
our organizations that we collect data

663
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:31,260
we don't actively search for keywords on

664
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:33,240
these sources because that would

665
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,250
basically expose for who we're doing

666
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,260
this so we're just collecting the data

667
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:40,230
store it in a database and then do

668
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,930
offline analysis with that so that's the

669
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:45,450
more generic type thing what can happen

670
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:48,240
is that out of that data collection we

671
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,400
can indeed find a seller selling credit

672
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,770
cards or documents or or account

673
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,130
information and then we can actively

674
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:57,540
engage with whoever the seller is and

675
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:01,100
specifically purchase that data for our

676
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:08,760
customer so it's two separate things

677
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:15,540
Thanks any other questions I don't

678
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:19,700
believe you or it was very clear and

679
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:25,760
you're all very smart or you don't care

680
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:28,100
it's fine doesn't matter let's chance

681
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,960
going once

682
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:36,199
all right thank you all right

683
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,200
then next was Thank You Misha
