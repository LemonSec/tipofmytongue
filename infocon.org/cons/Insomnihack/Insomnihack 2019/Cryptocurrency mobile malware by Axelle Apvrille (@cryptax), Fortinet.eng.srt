2
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,079
okay thanks for joining me for this

3
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:23,829
session so basically we're going to talk

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,480
about money right and fortunately I

5
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:28,660
don't think you'll end up at the end of

6
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,759
the talk really rich but you will

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:36,010
probably have learned if it's the case

8
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:39,460
for cyber criminals or not so there are

9
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:43,300
actually different ways to abuse

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,120
cryptocurrencies and um we're gonna have

11
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:49,000
a look a little bit how this is done on

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,879
computers just besides smart phones will

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,110
put smartphones a little bit away

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:55,030
abusing cryptocurrencies how it has

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,410
already been done quite a lot on

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:01:04,239
computers crypto jacking is one of those

17
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:07,630
techniques so crypto jacking is using

18
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,939
your computer without your consent to do

19
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:12,579
some mining and getting some money for

20
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,408
the attacker that's one of the things

21
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:18,178
which is puzzle well one of the

22
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:18,179
possibilities to abuse cryptocurrencies

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,350
an example of those is the malware which

24
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:29,859
is known as 0xs botnet also known as CF

25
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:34,449
F and this one is abusing and mining

26
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:38,259
cryptocurrencies behind your back are

27
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:40,119
the way to be abusing those is bullet

28
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,009
stealers at this time you are going to

29
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:44,409
grab the money exactly you're ready

30
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:49,469
where it is inside the wallet so you'll

31
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:52,749
get the private keys of the victim and

32
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:55,178
basically empty empty has a account that

33
00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:58,029
way there are plenty of different ways

34
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:02,020
to implement wallets dealers will see

35
00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:03,039
that a little bit afterwards like well

36
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,408
fake wallets

37
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,959
that's when possibly but also clipper

38
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,489
clippers which are manipulating the

39
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:16,630
clipboard manager we have also

40
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:18,430
ransomware so ransomware they what is

41
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,340
the link the tie with cryptocurrency

42
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,210
it's that most of the time they are

43
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,910
asking

44
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:27,730
for the ransom in bitcoins or some other

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:30,730
cryptocurrency we'll see a few examples

46
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,709
for that one famous perhaps that you

47
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,470
have seen word that I like little bit is

48
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:37,630
this one the Kirke ransomware on Windows

49
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:40,840
which is actually paying a tribute to

50
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:44,380
Star Trek and and so it encrypts all

51
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,140
your files on them on the computer pens

52
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:51,700
an extension Kirk for James Kirk and

53
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:55,450
asks for a ransom in manaro between 500

54
00:02:51,700 --> 00:03:00,489
and 1000 and 500 US dollars so pretty

55
00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:02,980
high amount and finally you've got like

56
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:05,110
the last categories where I puts like

57
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:08,160
basically all the rest all the scams

58
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:11,710
which are related to crypto currencies

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:16,269
it can be anything which is going to

60
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:20,200
like from social engineering to some

61
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,750
other parts like people are going to

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,390
trust you to do something and actually

63
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:27,790
while it's totally fake and they're not

64
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,799
doing it so they will tell you oh if you

65
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,590
do this or that I'm gonna give you a

66
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:34,030
Bitcoin to reward you

67
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:37,410
given the current price of a Bitcoin

68
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:42,790
it's a little bit surprising right but

69
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:46,750
people some people will trust on

70
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:50,049
androids well we can actually see lots

71
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,900
of those stuff also being abused in

72
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:56,910
various malware the first thing here

73
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,790
that we see actually is that I've got my

74
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:03,010
mouse pointer here is that malware

75
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:06,459
started to pop up around

76
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:10,209
cryptocurrencies in 2014 this is where

77
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:13,840
we saw quite a couple of malware with

78
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:16,780
reports there abusing various currencies

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:22,200
and then there's suddenly not so much

80
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:27,849
activity until like by the end of 2015

81
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:30,669
and then again in 2017 it pops back up

82
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:34,780
on our radars with plenty of new malware

83
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:35,568
around us we don't know exactly why

84
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,599
suddenly

85
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:42,379
it pops up in 2017 but probably of

86
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:44,929
course the the markets rate of the

87
00:04:42,379 --> 00:04:47,360
bitcoins going up and up is probably for

88
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:50,149
something one of the reasons that

89
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,520
attackers really gained some interest in

90
00:04:50,149 --> 00:04:57,949
the for that song on mobile phones this

91
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,109
is basically for afterwards you'll have

92
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:03,349
the slides if you want to investigate

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,119
one of these malware personally well you

94
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:07,550
could have all you've got the links

95
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:09,050
there and some hashes there so that you

96
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:13,069
can look into those malware for

97
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:16,069
yourselves and this is precisely what

98
00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:18,680
we're gonna do when most of the rest of

99
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:22,599
this talk is we are going to investigate

100
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:27,139
some of those recent malware

101
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:31,610
so in January 2019 so like two months

102
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:36,019
ago I encountered quite a few Bitcoin

103
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:39,459
mobile miners so this one is posing

104
00:05:36,019 --> 00:05:43,430
openly as a Bitcoin miner for Android

105
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:45,619
with a very nice picture and it's always

106
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,709
very kind to the end user it tells it

107
00:05:45,619 --> 00:05:50,629
tells you you know mining bitcoins this

108
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:53,149
is pretty intensive and it's really

109
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:55,519
going to heat up for your CPU and your

110
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:57,499
batteries you'd better monitor it but

111
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:01,610
we'll do it for you so this is really

112
00:05:57,499 --> 00:06:04,639
very contrite and actually it keeps its

113
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,249
promises on the for for that point if we

114
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,939
have a look at the code and you compile

115
00:06:07,249 --> 00:06:13,909
it while we see this this method here

116
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:16,189
which is actually indeed monitoring the

117
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:18,769
temperature of the CPU grabbing it from

118
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:23,209
a file on the file system here and then

119
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:25,579
displaying it to the end-user it also

120
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:28,459
told us it was mining yes well this is

121
00:06:25,579 --> 00:06:31,189
true but it is not mining for you and it

122
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:34,819
is not mining bitcoins but it is mining

123
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:37,430
manaro for that it is using a quite

124
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:41,449
well-known library which is known as

125
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:43,610
coin hive and this library is a

126
00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:47,209
JavaScript library which will only work

127
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:49,099
for mana row and there are basically

128
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:49,390
quite a couple of things we're here

129
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:52,090
which

130
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:54,719
legitimate so what happens is that you

131
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:57,880
can just with a few lines of code

132
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,310
inserts this mining library into your

133
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:05,200
application or into your website and

134
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:08,680
then a window will pop up and ask you do

135
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,930
you are you ok for for this website or

136
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,010
this application to do some mining on

137
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:19,290
your device right so if it asks for your

138
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:23,770
consents this is I'd say relatively ok

139
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:26,020
this is altered mining here the problem

140
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:29,560
is that it can be abused and if you just

141
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,859
use this time coin hive library here

142
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,330
well it doesn't ask for n for any of

143
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,360
your consents any longer

144
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,159
and then of course it starts mining and

145
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,350
the background and you're not aware of

146
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:43,660
it it consumes your resources and the

147
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:48,880
money doesn't go to you but to the

148
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:51,700
attacker and there are lots lots of

149
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,640
those samples that we are that we have

150
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:57,849
in our malware database so I had a look

151
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:00,580
and scans quite a couple of those what

152
00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:04,210
you can see here is that actually so the

153
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:07,359
the money which is mind goes to give an

154
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:10,270
account which is identified by this your

155
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,970
site key which is the identifier for

156
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:15,070
your for the attacker so I had a look at

157
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:17,350
the various site keys that I could find

158
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:19,120
in different malware and you see that

159
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,050
sometimes those are reused across

160
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,060
different samples but sometimes even

161
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,950
more than difference in more than just a

162
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:30,850
couple of time this one for this key for

163
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:34,960
instance was used over two hundred and

164
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:36,460
eighty-seven different apps and if you

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,770
think that some apps or may be

166
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:40,930
downloaded let's say just only one

167
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:44,250
thousand time this means that there are

168
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:47,920
two hundred and eighty seven thousand

169
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:50,980
instances of a suburb of people

170
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,260
potentially mining for this this site

171
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:58,600
key so this is pretty what lots of

172
00:08:53,260 --> 00:09:00,520
people again in January I don't know why

173
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,740
it was the months for Bitcoin miners I

174
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,800
guess

175
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,170
another application I bumped into again

176
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,780
saying and claiming claiming openly it

177
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,670
was a Bitcoin miner but this time it's

178
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,010
totally fake it's not even mining

179
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:17,790
anything else at all it's just pure

180
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:20,189
leaves displaying an image like this one

181
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,469
you see there's a miner here you've got

182
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,780
a button here when you play this press

183
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:27,230
button well you have the image of like

184
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:30,089
the miner going through the mine and

185
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:33,510
getting some coal there but nothing

186
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:36,210
really happens except it tells you it

187
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:39,420
displays on the user interface but as we

188
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:42,540
saw can we trust user interfaces well

189
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:48,060
here it's yeah I tell view it's mining

190
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,640
but it's not it has also lots of

191
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,199
settings to look like a real application

192
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,310
and for instance this one is interesting

193
00:09:52,200 --> 00:10:00,000
here the upgrade plan so I had a look at

194
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,130
first I am only mining 100 mega hashes

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,550
per second which is already enormous on

196
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:08,340
the smartphone but pretty cool if I want

197
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,620
to remind better than that and gain more

198
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:14,520
bitcoins of course I can upgrade and

199
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,460
here I have like a demo premium plan and

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:21,930
if I read them and give Lee leave a nice

201
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:24,510
feedback I will get this plan so I did

202
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:27,150
except I didn't even have to read them

203
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,460
because it's not fake at that point you

204
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:33,720
just have to click and you get for free

205
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:35,850
this this new plan and there you got I

206
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,960
got that you have bought new miner plan

207
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:44,300
and now I am mining at 200 mega hashes a

208
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:48,630
second on an Android and later of course

209
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:50,280
no problem there the other one I don't

210
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:52,610
know if you notice but it's really I

211
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:55,589
find this one quite strange is

212
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,690
personalized advertising GG pure I

213
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:59,130
didn't had never noticed that's you know

214
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:03,990
GG Fuhrer had something to do with that

215
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:07,260
but well and indeed this is what's the

216
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,300
application does is only displaying ads

217
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:12,439
so you install something you're not

218
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,030
mining but you are viewing tons of

219
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,910
advertisement and you think about it

220
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:20,040
it's actually quite smart because if you

221
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,199
want an application to do some mining

222
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,240
especially on a smartphone you can you

223
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,280
probably have to run it quite a lot if

224
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,310
you want to run it quite a lot it means

225
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:31,770
that you will have it to display that it

226
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,680
is running and so you will be viewing

227
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,620
the apps the advertisement all the time

228
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,420
all right so it's a one way to ensure

229
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:43,650
that you are going to see the

230
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:47,579
advertisement in the end you have widen

231
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:50,790
all managed you gets like a lots of

232
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,390
bitcoins and you think it's time to go

233
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:58,380
whiter now to to travel a little bit and

234
00:11:54,390 --> 00:12:01,439
get rich so you wants to get the money

235
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:04,500
right of course it's fake don't dream

236
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,780
and actually what happens in the

237
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:11,070
implementation it's totally fake is that

238
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:13,920
you have a hard coded for first stages

239
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,530
you'll go first in the pending stage

240
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,050
then five days later approve five days

241
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:24,180
later in processing five days later

242
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:27,030
later sent so 15 days later you will see

243
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:29,370
that well actually it has been sense but

244
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:32,930
you haven't received any money of course

245
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:35,460
but you will have been viewing

246
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:40,550
advertisement for 15 days so that is

247
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:44,280
very good for them in case you wonder

248
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:46,829
well you cannot do any Bitcoin mining on

249
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,760
a smartphone if you are really serious

250
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:52,380
about Bitcoin mining this is you need

251
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,870
dedicated hardware and you need to buy a

252
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,420
ZX and this is basically some of the

253
00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:00,540
reasons one that you can get on the

254
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,729
market and they they mine around

255
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:06,360
something Tierra hashes per second

256
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:10,170
between 30 and 70 on the smartphone even

257
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,930
on a good one it's 70 hashes per second

258
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:18,120
so there's a difference of 10 to the

259
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:19,979
power 12 okay so you have no chance of

260
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:27,990
mining anything on a smartphone for

261
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:30,170
bitcoins February so in February

262
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,300
researcher named Luca Stefan

263
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:38,939
co-discovered a clipper and then all

264
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:41,099
four on the Google Play Store and this

265
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,120
clipper so it is manipulating the

266
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:48,780
clipboard I'll explain it a bit more

267
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,580
here what happens is that when you want

268
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:54,990
for instance to send some money to

269
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:59,730
somebody else using crypto currencies

270
00:13:54,990 --> 00:14:01,770
you're gonna ask him or her the his his

271
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:03,360
address the wallet address and the

272
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:05,550
wallet addresses are always

273
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,610
unfortunately quite long and different

274
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:12,120
to memorize so I say okay give me your

275
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:14,790
wallets address and I'm never going to

276
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,340
memorize this so I put it's like most of

277
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:20,610
the time in the clipboard and then I

278
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:24,180
send okay I'm gonna send you this amount

279
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,910
of money and I think I am sending it to

280
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,510
just the address I have put in the

281
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,160
clipboard

282
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:31,410
but the Clipper has replaced this

283
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,140
address with the address of the attacker

284
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:36,589
so actually I'm not paying you I am

285
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:41,990
paying somebody else giving him freely

286
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:45,630
some some money so this is the code of

287
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:49,700
the method which is implementing the

288
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:54,750
clipboard management it grabs here and

289
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:56,850
this variable the the content of the

290
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,920
clipboard manager and then it is going

291
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,640
based on that on it based on a very

292
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:07,050
simple algorithm trying to decide if

293
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:09,510
this is new thorium wallet address or a

294
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,370
Bitcoin wallet address and depending on

295
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:13,680
that it will replace with the attackers

296
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:19,560
ether iam wallet address or the

297
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:23,400
attackers Bitcoin wallet address so I

298
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,030
noticed notice this address here 17m 616

299
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:29,910
I thought well let's track and have a

300
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:34,410
look at how much money they made on this

301
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:37,140
address as you may know it's like partly

302
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:40,560
anonymous bitcoins but you can trace the

303
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:43,590
transactions so you can go openly on

304
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,810
website have a look at some at the trees

305
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:48,510
entrance which are actually involving

306
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:50,760
this address and we can see cells this

307
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,960
one is yeah probably a bit small for you

308
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,740
but there were six different

309
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:59,670
transactions for a total of 0.12

310
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,830
bitcoins which is approximately 500 US

311
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:07,349
dollars and we can see the various

312
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:09,600
transactions there so not much I cannot

313
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,810
be sure at this point that it was all

314
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,180
done with the Clipper malware but I know

315
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:19,469
at least that they didn't get more than

316
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:24,120
500 US dollars based on based with with

317
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:27,810
this malware actually this wasn't the

318
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,540
first clipper which was in the well that

319
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:33,359
was a new first one in August two

320
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,000
thousand eighteen and it was actually a

321
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,880
little slightly more advanced in the

322
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,300
fact that it was not hard coding the

323
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,390
wallets addresses of of the malware

324
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:47,880
author but it was contacting a remote

325
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:50,550
server to get the wallet address which

326
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:53,040
was appropriate in this case so this one

327
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:58,260
well actually we're going to do some

328
00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:04,170
live reverse engineering for this one so

329
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:05,699
I have loaded the sample there and we

330
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:08,069
have a look first at the Android

331
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:10,260
manifest and have a look at where is the

332
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,500
main activity the main activity can be

333
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:17,280
recognized quite easily by the tag here

334
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,380
main and launcher and they are very nice

335
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,569
in at this case because they named it at

336
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,819
the end main activity so that's quite

337
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,240
handy to to recognize which is the main

338
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,360
activity so we can go and have a look at

339
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,750
this mimic to the team and decompile it

340
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:36,449
and so the main activity is the first

341
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:39,360
activity which is going to pop up when

342
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,250
you click on the application icon and

343
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,189
the first method which actually gets

344
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:47,280
called is on trace that's the wait runs

345
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:50,400
and we see that it is first well

346
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,950
creating a thread here see a little bit

347
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,810
afterwards what's happening

348
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,220
then it's the

349
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:59,750
service in background and the this

350
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:03,840
service is called the clipboard service

351
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:08,580
then this line here is a specific trick

352
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:13,020
to remove the application icon okay and

353
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:16,620
then it's going to toast a specific text

354
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:20,400
on the screen and here the text is

355
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:24,479
actually not supported on your device

356
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,640
and deleted so it will look like the

357
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,190
application has been uninstalled it will

358
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,050
say oh it's not supported remove the

359
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:33,210
application and you will have a feeling

360
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:35,970
that the application is no longer there

361
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,940
but it is wrong the application is still

362
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:44,160
there and the some background services

363
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:46,350
are still running so the background

364
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,300
service is clipboard service and here in

365
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:50,070
the thread what it is doing well it is

366
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,669
contacting the remote server and just

367
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:56,970
sending like something a things which is

368
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:59,850
the URL where we can have a look it is

369
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:03,210
set in gates and gates is populated here

370
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:06,899
so this is the remote web server which

371
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:11,760
is contacted in that case it's no longer

372
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,140
operational by hmm by the way so we're

373
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,940
gonna have a look at the clipboard

374
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:20,640
service and it's basically the same

375
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:26,520
thing the first method which gets called

376
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:29,700
is on traits oops I prefer you have a

377
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:32,160
look at this that way and what is it

378
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,180
doing well we see it is instantiating a

379
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:39,380
clipboard manager this one and this one

380
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:42,840
if we click here we see that it is

381
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:48,390
valued with this subclass of the

382
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:51,720
clipboard service so I go here and in

383
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:54,540
there we see indeed the algorithm for

384
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,760
the gum which is going to handle the

385
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,980
clipboard manager and it's basically the

386
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,450
same thing here we are going to read

387
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:07,210
what is in the clipboard so I can rename

388
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:12,299
that's clip

389
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:17,320
text there we go

390
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:20,110
and well it is going to try and make out

391
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,720
and understand what type of address this

392
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:26,979
is so those are different payment

393
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,899
services this is web money I think

394
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:35,049
different instances and then you have

395
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:40,479
money row here's Bitcoin - dogecoin is

396
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:43,990
Ed cash aetherium litecoin and the last

397
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:46,659
one is black coin here and so with

398
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,570
thanks for instance that it is a light

399
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:52,390
coin if the address starts with an L and

400
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:55,960
that the length is more than that and

401
00:20:52,390 --> 00:21:00,419
this is more than 34 characters

402
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:03,399
okay so it is a simple algorithm but

403
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:06,340
apparently it works in quite a couple of

404
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:09,760
cases and what does it do well the first

405
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:11,439
thing is going to send a log reports

406
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:15,309
this is this one is not very interesting

407
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,370
but this one here is so this is the

408
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:21,870
clipboard service didn't like that it's

409
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:21,870
always easier to read

410
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,200
so it's infant instantiates a thread in

411
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:33,520
that thread it is going to contact the

412
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,940
remote server with so this is the URL

413
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,668
the end of the URL it's going to tell

414
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:42,279
what is the wallet address that it has

415
00:21:39,669 --> 00:21:44,200
in the clipboard manager and here it

416
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,140
will send that to the remote server the

417
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:52,450
remote server is going to answer with

418
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:55,840
the attackers rule its address so now in

419
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:58,299
this one let's call it address because

420
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,459
it depends if it's the wallet address in

421
00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:03,010
the clipboard or the needy attackers in

422
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:10,240
the end here we have the attackers rule

423
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:12,850
that's address and once this is done it

424
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,260
is going actually to change it's in the

425
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:19,830
clipboard and let's go here so this is

426
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,830
an address

427
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:27,210
it looks if this address is already in

428
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:29,850
the clipboard or not if it isn't well

429
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:31,830
it's just going to copy and paste it in

430
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:42,290
the clipboard manager and that's how it

431
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:46,050
works right so back to our slides so

432
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:49,610
those were backup slides in case it

433
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:49,610
didn't work never know

434
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:56,130
we have also I talked about bullet steel

435
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:59,070
as well we don't we have that as well on

436
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,540
androids and for instance an example

437
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:06,450
that we came across was a fake a thorium

438
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:09,620
bullet if you are into if the rim you

439
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:12,360
might know my ether wallet which is

440
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:15,629
quite popular wallet for for this

441
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,060
currency what some people don't know is

442
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:21,360
that there is no mobile version for this

443
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,940
wallet so whenever you find well at

444
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,010
least currently a mobile version of my

445
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,440
ether wallet it is certainly not

446
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,810
official and in some cases malicious

447
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,240
this is the case of this one so you

448
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:36,389
think you are installing legitimates

449
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:38,670
bullets and the first thing it asks you

450
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,730
for is your private key to be able to

451
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:44,850
import your account of course right so

452
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,710
you enter your private key but what

453
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:49,350
happens actually of course is that it

454
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,140
sends it to a remote database which is

455
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,090
accessible to the attacker and just

456
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,390
prints out in the end out sorry

457
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:59,669
invalid credentials we didn't manage to

458
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,500
import your accounts and meanwhile of

459
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:08,100
course the attacker can just empty your

460
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:11,820
account ransomware ransom error also of

461
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:14,399
course popular on mobile films we've got

462
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,870
a family which is known as locker or

463
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,180
lucky BOTS with over 100,000 samples for

464
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:24,840
those and it's still very active it

465
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:27,000
started in 2017 is still active we have

466
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,760
some samples which are new new versions

467
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,330
in February of this year and in the end

468
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,190
well the

469
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,850
those ransomware do of course is lock

470
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:41,540
your screen and ask for a ransom and the

471
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,980
ransom is asked in Bitcoin so we see it

472
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:48,409
for instance here so I thought well okay

473
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,240
how is it doing that it would be

474
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:53,330
interesting to understand how it is

475
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:56,360
actually locking my screen and so we

476
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:59,419
have a look this one in particular was

477
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,699
posing as an Adobe Flash Player and the

478
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:03,590
first thing when it installs is it's

479
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,160
going to ask for the device

480
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,709
administrator rights so now if you were

481
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:12,560
security aware person asking for device

482
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:15,620
admin rights for a Flash Player that's

483
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,230
this should raise an alarm right because

484
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:20,090
it's pretty high rights for something

485
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,570
which obviously obviously is not going

486
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:26,209
to need it but if you are just like the

487
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:29,480
standard end user you are probably a bit

488
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:32,750
confused and you might enable those

489
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:36,050
rights actually at the beginning nothing

490
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:38,000
happens what are the things the nasty

491
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,970
things only start to begin to happen

492
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,850
when you try to disable or uninstall the

493
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:46,100
application when you try to uninstall

494
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,500
the application well it won't be

495
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,120
uninstalled you tells you you first have

496
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,630
to remove the device administrator

497
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,389
rights so you go and try to disable the

498
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,700
device administrator rights and there

499
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,850
you go and you get an ugly pop-up and

500
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,510
it's not working and then in the end you

501
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:12,290
get your screen locked on that term

502
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:14,210
ransom demands the code so actually when

503
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:16,250
you are trying to disable the Weisse

504
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:18,320
administrator rights you will get into a

505
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:21,650
method which is called on disable

506
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,010
requested right and here we see that it

507
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:29,750
is getting a layout and the layout name

508
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:33,170
is well not very easy HFD edge effects

509
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:37,160
something like that and if we have a

510
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:40,040
look at this very beautiful layout name

511
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:44,390
well it just says unable to uninstall

512
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,180
the application then what it is doing

513
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,500
here

514
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:54,510
is that it is cooling a horrible Maine's

515
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:56,940
method okay with a horrible horrible

516
00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:01,110
string you know hard life you know for

517
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,840
reverses like me so you have a look here

518
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,439
at this method and you see that it is

519
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,850
the D obfuscation algorithm I was quite

520
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,640
lucky for this one because it's really

521
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:15,600
not too complicated first you do an XOR

522
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:23,190
with 88 and then on the next bytes the

523
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:25,860
XOR will be on 3 V 2 is 3 it's here so

524
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,470
it's quite easy to do that the only

525
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:30,780
point here is that in the throughout the

526
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,780
sample it is always changing those

527
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:36,750
constants so you just can't apply the

528
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:38,940
same algorithm on all the strings it

529
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,920
won't work you have to put the right

530
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:44,280
constants all the time so that makes it

531
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:49,050
slightly more difficult so we do that

532
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:51,990
and this at least between string turns

533
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:55,050
into window which is more understandable

534
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:58,650
and this means that we are getting the

535
00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:00,300
system service window adding a view so

536
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:03,780
basically that means that we're going to

537
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:09,180
display this window which shows unable

538
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:12,090
to install application so actually here

539
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,580
I should have had this text but in my

540
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:24,320
Android emulator for a reason I don't

541
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:28,230
know why it wasn't showing ok yeah ok

542
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:33,300
then after that it is starting another

543
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:36,180
activity and this activity is a sub sub

544
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,450
class of stream lock we go and have a

545
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:42,720
look there and then again we see that it

546
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:46,080
is lowing loading another layout again

547
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,220
with another ugly name will well shorten

548
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,090
a little bit the task

549
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:56,420
this one is displaying the ransom and

550
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:59,220
again it is calling a horrible name for

551
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,320
for a method we deal

552
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,600
okay that and this is again window

553
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:06,210
you're lucky so it means it's going to

554
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:09,360
display the layer the Ransom on the on

555
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:12,000
the screen so we have the ransom notes

556
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,158
on the screen how does it manage to lock

557
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,750
it's that we can't move to something

558
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,350
else well it implements third which is

559
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:25,470
called on window focus which will get

560
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:27,689
called each time we try and view

561
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,340
something else another application

562
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:32,549
another window and that'll lay out

563
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:35,158
something like that and here well it is

564
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:37,770
sending a broadcast of an intense with

565
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:42,150
again some horrors but when you dis

566
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:44,280
deoxys gates this only means well closed

567
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:48,510
system dialogues so this is what it is

568
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:51,840
doing you try to shift to another window

569
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:53,850
it sends BAM close it try to move

570
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,100
another one close it it will always

571
00:29:53,850 --> 00:30:04,799
close all the the other windows that you

572
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:06,629
try to open so I thought well ok let's

573
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:12,090
have a look if they are profitable or

574
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:14,510
not so this is actually I took this yes

575
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:18,990
this address from the screenshots this

576
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:21,330
119 to you let's have a look and see if

577
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:25,429
they are profitable or not if they're

578
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:30,360
getting rich with us and I'm gonna for

579
00:30:25,429 --> 00:30:32,850
the first one got 50 bitcoins this is a

580
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,639
huge amount amount of money two hundred

581
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,090
thousand dollars okay so I thought wow I

582
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:42,090
hadn't thought they did make that much

583
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:45,030
to be honest let's check it a little bit

584
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,908
more so again I had a look at the

585
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:52,260
various transactions on on the

586
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:54,740
Internet's and I went through a couple

587
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,780
of the the first transactions and then

588
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:01,500
things didn't exactly add up the way I

589
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:04,830
had expected I know that for this ransom

590
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:08,970
well the ransom is either 70 US dollars

591
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:12,800
or 100 not something in between is

592
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:15,340
either 70 or 100 so then I once

593
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:18,919
exactly through all the transactions and

594
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:22,879
99 dot 42 well that's probably 100 with

595
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:27,050
you know the the exchange rate this is

596
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:31,730
possible but this one 1996 this is no

597
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:33,770
way near 70 or 100 this is wrong and I'm

598
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:36,530
doing that for all the transactions and

599
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:39,260
ruling out those which are not coming

600
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:45,170
from the the sample the malicious sample

601
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:47,120
that's I am looking into and then like a

602
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:50,780
few hours later

603
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:54,350
well I summed up all the amounts they

604
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:56,990
had got and it's only 600 u.s. else well

605
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:59,510
it's already pretty good but it's not

606
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:02,000
200 thousand it's only six hundred US

607
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:05,570
dollars there for this particular sample

608
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,610
now the two hundred thousand are maybe

609
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:10,760
coming from some other malware it's

610
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,590
probably malicious or elicits a traffic

611
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,840
but it's not coming from the Android

612
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:20,570
Android sample that we have been

613
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:22,189
investigating so we have seen ransomware

614
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:25,100
things I'm not you're probably wondering

615
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:28,450
if we can also have some malicious minor

616
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:31,490
as well the good point here is that

617
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:35,180
miners have been bands from the Play

618
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:38,510
Store in July 2018 so it hardens a

619
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:40,970
little bit the task but of course we can

620
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:44,230
still have some malicious samples either

621
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:47,120
on Google Play or in other marketplaces

622
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:49,340
this is an example of one of those

623
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,429
malicious miners

624
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:55,429
so this one is mining actually on a pool

625
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,570
which is supports XMR so it is mining

626
00:32:55,430 --> 00:33:00,050
for mana bro

627
00:32:56,570 --> 00:33:03,800
and when you are mining on the pool you

628
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:06,350
usually well you give the username for

629
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:10,610
what the it's like an identifier to know

630
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:12,980
who is mining and then there's a user

631
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:15,379
password but this has actually nothing

632
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,170
to do with a password it's more like a

633
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,510
kind of a label for the various workers

634
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:25,130
and here what is interesting we see in

635
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,250
the code that it will put as for this

636
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:31,380
label the

637
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:34,500
manufacturer for the smartphone so I had

638
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:37,860
a look live at this malware mining and

639
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,860
infecting some some people and we see

640
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,810
here that well it is it has actually

641
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:47,149
infected at that time it had infected

642
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:49,590
four different different devices we have

643
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:52,470
Amazon I didn't know they did smart

644
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:56,820
furnace but probably well way Lenovo and

645
00:33:52,470 --> 00:34:00,750
Samsung and they were mining at eight

646
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,179
eight hashes per seconds eight eight and

647
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:06,540
fifty hashes per second so for total

648
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:12,168
hash rate of sixty six hashes per second

649
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:16,830
this is very low of course in the end

650
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:20,190
for one month and that a attacker gained

651
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:25,440
six US dollars so well he's not getting

652
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:27,330
rich rich with that one and finally I

653
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,840
told you also that there were plenty of

654
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:33,989
other scams crypto scams I pretty like

655
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:36,810
particularly like this one where we have

656
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:38,729
some Android applications who are mining

657
00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:42,239
some cryptocurrencies

658
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:43,139
which are which cannot be mines so they

659
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:47,189
tell you for instance

660
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:51,000
oh this application is an elite XRP this

661
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:54,300
is for ripple miner and mine ripple

662
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,399
cannot be mined by design so this is

663
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:59,340
pretty stupid but if you don't know well

664
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:03,390
you can get fooled there are some others

665
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:05,460
here um yeah I think that tether minor

666
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,830
also also is another currency which

667
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,660
cannot be your minds but they can still

668
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:16,170
mind that everything is possible in an

669
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:19,379
android application right so and then

670
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:21,540
you might be wondering if it's possible

671
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:25,140
to bind all together on a smartphone

672
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:28,350
well the answer is close to no they

673
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:31,170
haven't been designed to do any mining

674
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:33,150
and if you are if you want your mind on

675
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,890
your smartphone be here of the heat i

676
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:37,410
know that some researchers tried and

677
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:38,120
they really kind of nearly popped their

678
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:42,589
there

679
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:44,990
trees for bitcoins really forget it's

680
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:47,390
totally but there are some other

681
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:50,419
algorithms there which are far less

682
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:53,270
intensive like kryptonite for Kryptonite

683
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:56,690
lights and those have been designed to

684
00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:00,440
be at least possibly possible to mine on

685
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:03,590
CPU so legitimate question there is well

686
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:08,270
could we possibly mind those currencies

687
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:11,390
on a smartphone so I tried and what and

688
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:15,759
gathered some hashes rates with various

689
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:18,140
smartphones those are old

690
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:24,500
smartphones and they have a pretty poor

691
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:27,230
hash rate those are more recent and

692
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:31,430
really decent smartphones but still it's

693
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:33,080
really a ridiculous / rates of 70 hashes

694
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:36,080
per second you need to be hashing

695
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,290
Killough hashes mega hashes to get Tara

696
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:44,350
hashes but nuts just you know hashes for

697
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:48,250
seconds so well there's no way you will

698
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:51,589
this is going to be profitable for you

699
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:53,870
then I thought well okay there's no way

700
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,510
you can mine on a smartphone why do we

701
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:59,029
see like things like that on the web

702
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:03,110
electron YUM the mobile based

703
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:05,480
cryptocurrency strange and last month

704
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:08,780
they even published about so they were

705
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,120
going to introduce on the market a

706
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,750
smartphone for that and look at the

707
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,319
specs

708
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:18,680
it's a quad-core 1.3 gigahertz this is

709
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,800
nothing really exceptional 480 US

710
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:26,690
dollars so it's not a great smartphone

711
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:31,040
and a bit strange right this other

712
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:33,170
company also is is claiming that's they

713
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,220
you can mind with your phone and you

714
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:39,560
will be the promise yeah to a theorems

715
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:43,790
for months so you you'd be able to gain

716
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:47,150
something like between 250 and 300 US

717
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:48,950
dollars per month the price of the

718
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,609
smartphone is quite expensive this one

719
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,629
is 3000

720
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:57,690
u.s. dollars so this one is expensive so

721
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,730
what is this about well it's not that

722
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:01,619
they're not scams they are true there

723
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,960
are actually legitimate but it's a

724
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:07,319
little bit of a play on words they are

725
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,900
not mining on the smartphone they are

726
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:11,910
mining in the cloud so this is pretty

727
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,970
different right

728
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:17,759
that's a smartphone for wings mobile

729
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:20,879
well actually the mining occurs on a

730
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:23,400
third party pool so you are not actually

731
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,369
buying a smartphone for three thousand

732
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,319
US dollars well you are but actually

733
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:31,950
what you are really paying for it is a

734
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:34,049
mining plan on this pool this is pretty

735
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:37,710
different and and then it makes sense

736
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:40,559
okay but it's not mining on the

737
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:44,339
smartphone same for electronic they were

738
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:47,039
not mining on the smartphone they are

739
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:51,119
mining on inside their cloud pretty

740
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:53,910
different so well it's nice ideas

741
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,249
especially the one so I like the one

742
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:58,890
about electron where the idea is to help

743
00:38:56,249 --> 00:39:00,899
developing countries but the problem is

744
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:04,019
that it is a little bit kind of

745
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:08,359
confusing for the end user and attackers

746
00:39:04,019 --> 00:39:11,160
are are using this confusion if you if

747
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:13,230
Spanish person can't know if it's

748
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:16,410
possible to mine on a mobile phone or

749
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:24,539
not then it's so easy to spread scams on

750
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:26,730
the marketplaces so it's not interesting

751
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:28,799
for an individual individual to be

752
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:31,170
mining on a mobile phone

753
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:33,329
how about attackers because for

754
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,269
attackers and cyber criminals it's

755
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:38,249
pretty different because they have loads

756
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:42,769
of smart phones that they can infect

757
00:39:38,249 --> 00:39:46,709
right they can easily infect 100,000 or

758
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:48,450
300,000 smart phones that's not such

759
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:51,749
such that much a big deal for them

760
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,399
they're not paying electricity that's

761
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:56,549
also something which is interesting for

762
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,559
them if they damage the phone well they

763
00:39:56,549 --> 00:40:00,930
not really looking to damages and

764
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,500
looking for that but it's not really too

765
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:04,149
much of their concern

766
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,340
and on top of that you've got the other

767
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:08,590
benefits of cryptocurrencies the fact

768
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:11,550
that it's sometimes difficult to trace

769
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:16,710
anonymous or things like that

770
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:19,420
um so I thought yeah that's another

771
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:22,000
another slide on another topic actually

772
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:24,460
I thought well I thought we saw plenty

773
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,100
of samples which are mining either

774
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:29,170
bitcoins or a menorah I thought are they

775
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,600
only targeting those two

776
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:35,140
cryptocurrencies or are there some other

777
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,560
cryptocurrencies well the answer is that

778
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:41,290
they are targeting actually a very wide

779
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,730
variety of cryptocurrencies you even

780
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:48,790
have some malware mining bollywood coin

781
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:51,580
does anybody know bollywood coin well I

782
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:57,100
didn't know okay crowd coin dinner Oh

783
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:58,990
gun coin orbit coin armies ago hard I

784
00:40:57,100 --> 00:41:06,880
know I mean that there's really lots of

785
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:09,490
those so how much money are they making

786
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,350
so we saw that with the miners actually

787
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:17,200
they're not making that much money right

788
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:21,339
it's like between three US dollars or in

789
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:25,240
some cases which is really poor and goes

790
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:27,610
up perhaps to two hundred US dollars we

791
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,930
have here a DB miner which was a little

792
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,780
bit better guts

793
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:33,609
one thousand US dollars but this one is

794
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:36,730
a little bit different because it was

795
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:39,190
infecting indeed some smartphones but

796
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:45,040
also plenty of TV boxes and other

797
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:48,520
devices which were more powerful so it's

798
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,550
not only a smartphone infection so it's

799
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:53,350
a little bit different the most

800
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:57,760
profitable ones are well we saw the

801
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:59,950
Clipper in February 2018 five hundred

802
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,160
dollars and also the ransomware around

803
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:08,290
six hundred US dollars there currently

804
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,259
seems to be the most profitable there so

805
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:14,380
based on that I can I think scheme a few

806
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:16,099
predictions so we saw that mobile miners

807
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,410
weren't that profit

808
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:24,349
so I think that those will probably

809
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:26,359
decrease in the future and on the other

810
00:42:24,349 --> 00:42:29,900
way we saw that so wallet stealers and

811
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:31,819
mobile ransomware well these had you

812
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:34,400
know a reasonable profit it's not as

813
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:38,119
profitable as it is on a computer but

814
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,859
still five hundred US dollars I guess

815
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,779
that in many countries there were four

816
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:44,869
script cadiz it's an interesting amount

817
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:47,960
so those will proudly increase and

818
00:42:44,869 --> 00:42:52,700
finally for the crypto scams well it's

819
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:55,130
like easy money you always had this for

820
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:58,450
we've had this for ages this is probably

821
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:01,849
going to continue it's easy to develop

822
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:03,980
people always have some funky ideas for

823
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:07,250
different attacks so this is probably

824
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:11,480
going to stay as it is for again the

825
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:15,109
next few months or years and that

826
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:20,029
concludes my talk and if you have any

827
00:43:15,109 --> 00:43:44,630
question I'm ready to ask that Thank You

828
00:43:20,029 --> 00:43:47,210
excellent any questions yes thank you

829
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:50,380
for your talk little question about yeah

830
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:53,059
crypto miners are not meant to be run on

831
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:55,460
phones but do you know if there are some

832
00:43:53,059 --> 00:43:57,559
software that were specifically of folks

833
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:02,289
trying to exploit all the power

834
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,289
including CPU GPU that is on the phone

835
00:44:03,549 --> 00:44:13,970
so yes the answer is basically on this

836
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:19,430
slide well in one of the malware hidden

837
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:24,049
minor there it is okay so here minor de

838
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:25,490
is a port of one of the mining software

839
00:44:24,049 --> 00:44:28,640
that you find traditionally for

840
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:29,569
computers Windows or Linux which has

841
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,839
been ported

842
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:36,170
in that case for Android so it works you

843
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,180
do indeed mine accepts that you don't

844
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:41,750
really have the power to get anything in

845
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:47,810
the end but the software works and runs

846
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:50,030
on on the platform does that answer your

847
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:52,730
question okay

848
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:56,360
do you know if does if it really use the

849
00:44:52,730 --> 00:45:08,930
GPU or only runs on the CPU now it uses

850
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:12,260
the CPU yes I think for you talk at some

851
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:14,450
point you in some side you've mentioned

852
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:17,330
that in mobile phone high-end mobile

853
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:19,129
phones they you would get around 70

854
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:22,009
hashes per second while they provoke

855
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:24,830
profitability threshold would sit at

856
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:26,840
around some number of tera hashes per

857
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,910
second even but isn't that essentially

858
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:31,850
comparing two different hashes hashing

859
00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:33,770
algorithms because I mean 70 makes sense

860
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:37,310
considering kryptonite which is like

861
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:41,110
very intensive but I cannot see any

862
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:44,950
other you know like bit connection they

863
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:47,780
like even a specialized hardware

864
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:51,339
achieving tera hashes per second with

865
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:56,620
the same algorithm that one ever uses

866
00:45:51,340 --> 00:46:04,490
yep so I actually I believe you refer to

867
00:45:56,620 --> 00:46:06,620
I'll get to the slide yeah exactly so

868
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:08,540
this is the same hashing algorithm or

869
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:12,950
are you comparing different ones because

870
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:15,580
it's those are here those are the

871
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:19,490
hashing rates for bitcoins so for the

872
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:22,340
algorithm for for there those yeah the

873
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:24,020
70 hashes per second you are even

874
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:26,300
correct because it's worse than that the

875
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,300
70 hashes per second that I have been

876
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:33,830
noticing is only on kryptonite's light

877
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:37,340
which is it would have been worse if I

878
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,620
had tried with bit with bitcoins okay so

879
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:41,510
I can't tell you how much less it would

880
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:42,319
have mean because I find the idea so

881
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:44,700
kind

882
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:47,788
stupid that I'm not even sure that

883
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:50,999
somebody has built a miner for bitcoins

884
00:46:47,789 --> 00:46:54,150
on Android yeah I mean it's definitely

885
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:57,538
because of how they you know the hashes

886
00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:00,329
the uses the probably a profitability

887
00:46:57,539 --> 00:47:03,059
threshold will be much higher but also

888
00:47:00,329 --> 00:47:06,720
the heart rate would be much higher not

889
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:09,990
sure if you get what I'm what I mean yes

890
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,970
but in that case a smartphone you would

891
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:14,519
only get let's say something like thirty

892
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:17,129
hashes per second so it's still

893
00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:20,220
ridiculous you still can't get any any

894
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:22,109
profit out of that I'm not arguing that

895
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:24,720
you would get profit with Bitcoin and

896
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:25,859
not with kryptonite mmm definitely it's

897
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,598
very hard to get profit with either

898
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:29,700
probably even less with Bitcoin as you

899
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:33,509
say but the hash rate for Bitcoin is

900
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,649
clearly higher it's not less than 70

901
00:47:33,509 --> 00:47:35,339
it's probably going to be much higher

902
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,990
than 70

903
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:41,640
I don't think so now okay but mmm it's

904
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:44,249
it's worth it right if you get the

905
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,558
results I'll be interested to to see

906
00:47:44,249 --> 00:47:48,839
what how many hashes per second you'll

907
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:54,119
get but I don't think your your you'll

908
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:55,609
get more than that we have time for one

909
00:47:54,119 --> 00:48:00,869
more question

910
00:47:55,609 --> 00:48:02,549
this is the presentation was very

911
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,579
interesting I have two small questions

912
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:09,739
one is our other network devices also

913
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:13,319
being used for hashing and crypto mining

914
00:48:09,739 --> 00:48:15,599
so network devices can you tell me what

915
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:17,880
you have in mind every home is now

916
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,130
having an ADSL router roughly sitting

917
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:25,049
there and are they being targeted in any

918
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:27,869
manner yes so I saw I know that we have

919
00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:33,259
some iut malware which are mining I

920
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:36,239
can't remember the name but if you go on

921
00:48:33,259 --> 00:48:38,670
40 guards blog for tonight's blog and

922
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:41,999
you searched like I think like the last

923
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:44,759
four months on the threat research you

924
00:48:41,999 --> 00:48:48,839
will find one of our researchers found

925
00:48:44,759 --> 00:48:53,130
one less than four months ago so yeah it

926
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:55,349
does it does happen and it was home

927
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,480
I think which was being infected and

928
00:48:55,349 --> 00:49:02,030
mining for an attacker that way

929
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:04,680
thank you other one was one of your

930
00:49:02,030 --> 00:49:06,930
presentations where you had gonna

931
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,118
reverse engineering code on it and you

932
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:15,210
said the core actually said that it was

933
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:16,950
being a particular type of a name given

934
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:23,550
to it is that all what you write to it

935
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:29,460
my ignorant self yes so on the reverse

936
00:49:23,550 --> 00:49:31,200
engineering here here you mean the

937
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:34,859
layouts of the the the name of the

938
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,629
layouts here no no no further up another

939
00:49:34,859 --> 00:49:38,970
screen lock No

940
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,619
yeah yeah those public classes screen

941
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:43,049
lock and so forth is that something that

942
00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:44,730
you get out of a classical debugger or

943
00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:47,790
reverse engineering colon is what you

944
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:50,550
write yes I put the the the Android

945
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:53,880
malware in an Android disassembler and

946
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:56,369
the compiler and it gives me the D

947
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:58,440
compiled code of the application so

948
00:49:56,369 --> 00:50:00,930
here's screen lock for instance is the

949
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:03,599
name that the malware authors came to

950
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:06,930
this class so it's not my code it's

951
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:09,859
their codes that I am decompiling thank

952
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,859
you you're welcome

953
00:50:12,230 --> 00:50:18,150
thank your Excel and time is up and now

954
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:20,770
we have 20 minute break and please give

955
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:23,150
another round of applause for oxygen

956
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:26,349
[Applause]

957
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,349
