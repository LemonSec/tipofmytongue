00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
um our presentation for today is loose

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,800
leaps might sinks clouds and as you can

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
see with the poster over here we took a

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,199
bit with the famous british

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,359
poster about loose leafs might sink

9
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,719
ships um so you know let's kick things

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,520
off

11
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,360
so uh it's not gonna be a speech we're

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,559
not talking about our company at all

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,440
just gonna say a few words about us so

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,440
um generally speaking we are part of the

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
veronica labs and we're responsible to

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
all sorts of

17
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,920
uh

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,680
coming up with new threat detections

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,200
response capabilities

20
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,440
uh research attack techniques

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,079
um persistency exfiltrations and whatnot

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,239
and you could read all about it later on

23
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,399
in our blog not now but

24
00:00:58,399 --> 00:00:59,359
um

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,680
we there are all sorts of school nuggets

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,440
over there

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,559
cool

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,880
so i'm david

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,280
hello i'm jason nice to meet you yeah

30
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
and get that sword yeah exactly

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,520
cool so uh as you all know um cloud

32
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,240
applications and the usage like sas or

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
whatever are becoming more prominent

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,000
than ever specifically with everything

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,320
related to the epidemic and organization

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,640
needs to rush you know to allow

37
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,400
employees to work from home rather than

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,920
from the safe environment and safe

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,119
quarters of the

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,040
classic on-prem uh i t so organizations

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,759
knew where the organization

42
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,159
actually start and ended right we know

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,079
that we have these assets we know that

44
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,159
we have these on-prem assets

45
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,600
and

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,439
with everything going on

47
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,759
such sas applications and services and

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,280
cloud services are becoming more

49
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,119
prominent in the way that

50
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,880
every employee in your organization

51
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,040
could actually become an admin

52
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
of sas application without anyone from

53
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,439
the idea of security actually knowing of

54
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,119
that right so

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,960
think about it it's called shadow i.t

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,240
and

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,280
how many

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,399
um how many organizations actually

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,319
let the marketing guy

60
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,480
actually handle and becoming an admin of

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,440
the facebook account of that

62
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,599
organization what happens if his account

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,480
is getting

64
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,800
compromised and someone starts posting

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,520
weird ads on the company's facebook page

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
saying that yeah it's a bitcoin scam or

67
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,080
you should click this and that

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,000
so that happens all the time and this is

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,840
what we're here to cover

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,080
um

71
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,959
let's see what else

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
so on top of that um we can

73
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,319
we can see that other applications and

74
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,000
other services as well doesn't

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
necessarily mean that they actually

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,400
integrate either with one another or to

77
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
the organization itself so there is no

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
centralized system or any uh identity

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,120
providing identity provider or a user

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,280
management system centralized one that

81
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,239
allows

82
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,560
uh decentralized user management for

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,879
permissions or accounts and whatnot

84
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,200
anyone could become any user of any

85
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,080
systems and that's it

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,920
usually security is an afterthought

87
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
security comes less because we need that

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
service we need that system right now

89
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,560
let's you know let's get it over with

90
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,879
let's work with that vendor because we

91
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,280
need it and security comes last

92
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
and that means that

93
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,799
it leads to the high risk and high

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,760
threats of the organization

95
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,640
as a whole

96
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,319
so again we covered the system knowledge

97
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
is non-existent and the shadow yt of

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
course like i said facebook marketing

99
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
hubspot instagram asana trello anyone

100
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,480
could become an admin on these platforms

101
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
so

102
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,959
as always

103
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,360
two doctors might come up with new ttps

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
new techniques and tactics and and

105
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,599
procedures but they continue to use the

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,480
same

107
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,720
age-old ttps that we're all aware of

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,560
such as credential stuffing

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,799
phishing campaigns exploiting publicly

110
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,959
accessible services with publicly

111
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,640
accessible exploits

112
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,920
and

113
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,280
sometimes

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
like in order to gain some information

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,200
about the organization about your

116
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,959
business it doesn't take more than a

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,159
browser

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,599
this is it that's it and

119
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
usually the mistakes that

120
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,079
keeps on coming are misconfiguration

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,280
over sharing and opening invitations

122
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
which you know

123
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,960
misconfiguration is

124
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,919
trying to you know giving everyone the

125
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,840
highest permission available like for

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
all the time for you know yeah i need

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,320
access to that document okay let's you

128
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
know take every permission that you need

129
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,080
oversharing allowing the information to

130
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,800
be leveraged and misused later on

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,520
and

132
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,520
with open invitation is allowing

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
non-organizational users

134
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
to join and access content

135
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,919
um such as video conference and zoom

136
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,040
chat rooms

137
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,240
specifically for you know um i have a

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,360
sharepoint click i'm just going to send

139
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
it to that vendor and that's it the link

140
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
is still alive and still accessible by

141
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,120
anyone from outside of the business

142
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,240
right so it happens all the time

143
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,199
um

144
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,639
for example third parties and

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,560
subcontractors for for example you have

146
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,080
your third parties and they have their

147
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,919
own third parties what's going on when

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,600
they try to share

149
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,479
your data with their third parties we

150
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,039
we're losing control of this data

151
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,479
and

152
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,280
it keeps on happening so we had a very

153
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,520
opportunistic look around to see what

154
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
could be acquired

155
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,639
while the focus was

156
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,360
uh on commonly used cloud applications

157
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
rather than looking through the the

158
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,759
looking glass of aws azure gcp

159
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
deployments and whatnot

160
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,360
so there was no specific organizations

161
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,479
that we

162
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,800
uh specifically targeted and looked for

163
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,240
and we could

164
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,400
seriously just scratching the surface i

165
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,520
mean like you

166
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,800
if you're looking to

167
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,840
come up with the posture of your

168
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,639
organization you could you know find out

169
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,919
very easily with what we're going to

170
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,318
talk about

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,000
on that we'll be sharing hints and tips

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,319
about how to get started and how to

173
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,000
check out the assets and posture of your

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,080
own business in order to see

175
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,360
for example how

176
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
um

177
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
transparent or how visible your

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
organization is online

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,400
we have some real world examples and

180
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,360
everything was anonymous

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
protect

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,160
the victims

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,360
and

184
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,800
of course we have some recommendations

185
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,160
to take away

186
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,080
now on top of that

187
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,840
we need to remember that the the key

188
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,639
risks over here for organizations are

189
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
pii leakage such as in also ip

190
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,440
intellectual property potential

191
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
vulnerabilities that could be used later

192
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,240
on to exploit uh organizations

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,880
and at the end also data tampering of

194
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,520
automated processes which we'll see and

195
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,520
talk about

196
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
um

197
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,840
you could also take these notes and take

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
back to your organization as we said and

199
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
this whole purpose is to you know come

200
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
up with

201
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,759
some hints and ideas for you to use

202
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,720
against your organizations

203
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,919
so what we're going to talk about is

204
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,639
cloud spotting

205
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,319
and

206
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,919
we have two approaches for cloud

207
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,000
spotting this is the the fact that this

208
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
is the actual actions that we'll talk

209
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,720
about

210
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,240
so the first one is that the application

211
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,560
oriented approach basically

212
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
we're looking for a specific application

213
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,520
and we don't care where we'll where we

214
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,199
will find it like

215
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,560
azure gcp and whatnot so we try to find

216
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
any exposed platform service or data

217
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,680
uh hosted all across the board

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
we are less concerned at this point

219
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
about targeting a specific organization

220
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,280
we want to see exactly how this

221
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,319
application is actually exposing data

222
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,199
and

223
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,440
we are focusing on platforms that are

224
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,039
usually known to be prone on

225
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,199
misconfiguration exploits or boost

226
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,520
forcing

227
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,319
now

228
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,160
this approach is also is also being

229
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
adopted by bug hunters you know if you

230
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
look for cool nuggets and of course

231
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,160
report later on and what not

232
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,960
but

233
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,919
um

234
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,479
the idea is you try and look for more

235
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,160
data from the bird's view

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
back in your organization about

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
sorry about this specific application

238
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,160
the other approach is called the

239
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,479
victim-oriented approach which we want

240
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
to identify any service on every cloud

241
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,199
application being used by a specific

242
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,240
single

243
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,759
target organization which this is

244
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
exactly what we're talking about

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
uh the organization posture

246
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,360
so it's very much like the

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
reconnaissance phase of a targeted

248
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,399
attack

249
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,919
and

250
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,440
the whole idea is to

251
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,958
minimize the risk minimize the blast

252
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,599
radius for a potential attack being used

253
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,519
later on about this organization

254
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,760
so victim-oriented approach is the one

255
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,600
that's being taken by any sort of trade

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,360
actors before they try to

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
attack the organization they try to

258
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,279
learn as much about it about any sort of

259
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
services applications being used

260
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,959
in this in this organization

261
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,720
cool that was a long

262
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,680
and

263
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
awkward moment standing there so thank

264
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,040
you

265
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
right so when when we talk about the the

266
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,680
application uh orientated approach uh

267
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,760
survey has said that's very much

268
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
taking a specific cloud application and

269
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,920
then trying to find out who's using it

270
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,000
and then perhaps find some juicy stuff

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
that we can take advantage of

272
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,080
okay so in this case the first thing you

273
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
need to consider when you look at that

274
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,959
application is

275
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,360
how is it configured or how do uh how

276
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,920
does the the user the the organization

277
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,480
actually use that service so of course

278
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,040
three pretty common ways you'll have the

279
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,680
customer's name you know the the user

280
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,600
dot cloud service

281
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,160
uh you'll have cloud service and then

282
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,399
slash some kind of customer name

283
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,360
or

284
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,320
perhaps

285
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
better

286
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,240
you'll have some kind of random id so of

287
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,040
course

288
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,200
the uh the first the first two options

289
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,839
there um those those identifiers will

290
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,079
often mimic that organization's domain

291
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,320
name i mean it's pretty pretty obvious

292
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
sometimes there may well be some slight

293
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,959
variations uh perhaps they'll use some

294
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,279
kind of regional marker perhaps that you

295
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
know it may include some kind of

296
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,120
department or you know of course another

297
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,640
common one is um it's sort of

298
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
development stages where you see you

299
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
know qa production all that kind of

300
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,040
stuff um so with that in mind

301
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
uh you know how how can we then go about

302
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,279
trying to

303
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,920
to i guess map out that that cloud

304
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,160
application how can we perhaps work out

305
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
who is using it uh and then you know

306
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,360
then we can troll through that data and

307
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,279
try and find some cool stuff um so i

308
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,800
think one of the one of the sort of

309
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,279
easiest ways and possibly combine these

310
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,120
two points um

311
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,519
so collecting passive dns records so if

312
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,640
you take a look at cloudapplication.com

313
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,040
uh okay and then go and query passive

314
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
dns you know

315
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,760
what

316
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,440
what's been what's been queried what's

317
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,440
uh what requests have gone out you know

318
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,720
that's going to give you quite a nice

319
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
list of potential subdomains to have a

320
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,200
poke okay of course there's a handful of

321
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,959
tools and services that you can use for

322
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,399
this there's various sub-domain lookup

323
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,560
tools there's you know a bunch of

324
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
different services that you can go off a

325
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
lot of these have free api access you

326
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,560
you know you don't have to pay anything

327
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,760
to uh to get started um so very a very

328
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,000
simple way to then start building up a

329
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,640
picture of who's doing what and where

330
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,839
okay

331
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,920
of course we can just crack out some

332
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,000
code as well so perhaps we could build a

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,519
dictionary of

334
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,120
particular terms

335
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,320
so here we could take perhaps a fortune

336
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,519
500 and grab all their domains

337
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,920
trim off the top level domain and throw

338
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
that against the service so that's quite

339
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,120
a good way of doing it

340
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,920
um

341
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,720
so the alexa top 1 million that's no

342
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,079
longer a thing but you can still get

343
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,560
hold of the data set so that's not bad

344
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,519
the umbrella one million i'm just saying

345
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:00,959
takes about

346
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,200
seven days i think to uh to trawl

347
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,040
through that on a number of services but

348
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,279
um but yeah if you if you kind of think

349
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
about it this is very basic python here

350
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,279
they literally just open up that nice

351
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,440
dictionary of terms you know that list

352
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
of potential organizations

353
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,920
and just throw it against the target

354
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,440
and then perhaps anything that comes

355
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,600
back with a good response you go great

356
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,360
i'll log that i can take a look at it

357
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,279
later if you're feeling a bit more

358
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,399
involved

359
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,639
then of course you could actually

360
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,959
scrape the result that comes back

361
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,000
perhaps then look to see if that service

362
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,920
has got something other than a other

363
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
than a login box

364
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
cure

365
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,839
when it comes to um to those those sort

366
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,920
of services using some kind of randomly

367
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,320
generated or you know whatever

368
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,880
identifier this of course

369
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
gets a little bit more difficult

370
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,680
so

371
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
you could try and brute force that if

372
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
you've got the time and the patience

373
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,920
i would imagine very quickly that

374
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
application is going to tell you to go

375
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,560
away

376
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,959
but yeah that's that's one

377
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
probably the easiest thing to look at

378
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,480
though with these types of app is just

379
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,160
some straight up search engine docking

380
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,360
so

381
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,839
the uh

382
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
so don't don't forget there are other

383
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,440
services than google uh any bing fans in

384
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
the house

385
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
literally no one okay so

386
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,040
again it's okay there's no shame in

387
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,920
using bing okay uh combining your

388
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
results combining your results so again

389
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,279
i know that you know this is teaching

390
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,959
people how to suck eggs a lot of people

391
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
are super familiar with you know sort of

392
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,279
basic talking but that's it when you

393
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,880
when you're trying to gather a data set

394
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,120
that you can then go back and poke and

395
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,000
prod

396
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
and then look to see if people are over

397
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
exposing or if they've misconfigured

398
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,920
stuff you know it's almost an iterative

399
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,399
process once you've you once you find an

400
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
app uh you then take a look at how it

401
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,519
looks you then might then uh craft some

402
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,320
decent dorks to uh to try and gather

403
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,560
more sources you know you might throw

404
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,600
other dictionaries at it combine it all

405
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,320
um ip address one down the bottom there

406
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,000
this is probably the one reason why i

407
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,760
would use bing

408
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,480
so

409
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,040
the fact that you can chuck in an ip and

410
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,959
then potentially get a list of search

411
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,160
results back that uh that show you

412
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,560
domains uh that are being hosted on that

413
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,399
that's that's kind of useful this one in

414
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,600
particular

415
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,279
if uh if i remember is um altassian so

416
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,800
they uh

417
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,160
they've got some stuff on aws so again

418
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,600
poke around

419
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,079
throw it back in see what comes out

420
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,120
okay

421
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
from a defensive perspective

422
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
perspective even um you always have to

423
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,440
think of yourself as the attacker you

424
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,839
know so i'm sure there's uh sort of

425
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,440
offensive practitioners in here as well

426
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
as defenders um so if you are defending

427
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
you know pay attention as well you know

428
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,240
you need to you need to poke and prod

429
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,000
your own infrastructure see what's going

430
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,680
down um

431
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
when we're uh yeah

432
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,480
when we're looking at this and when

433
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
you're trying to find out everything

434
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,279
about your own organization

435
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,720
you can absolutely use the methods a

436
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,800
moment ago you can you can chuck

437
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,639
keywords at

438
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,040
certain services you can uh you know you

439
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,279
can look at external passive dns sources

440
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,480
all the rest of it

441
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,199
also look at your own dns configuration

442
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,600
uh check out the cname records you know

443
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,959
perhaps you'll you'll see some service

444
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,440
that's you know you're redirecting some

445
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
nice friendly internal name to some

446
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
external service

447
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,560
and of course as

448
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,600
an added bonus you may well find some

449
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,839
sub-domain takeover opportunities as

450
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:44,800
well

451
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
in which you've got some lingering

452
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,440
record pointing to some third-party app

453
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,079
that's no longer being used so it's

454
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
again it's all about knowing

455
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,240
your configuration knowing what's going

456
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,160
on

457
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,199
uh

458
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,160
again tweak your dorks so when you're

459
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,560
looking for specific application perhaps

460
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,920
you know on those previous examples

461
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
you're looking in the title or you're

462
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,160
looking at some url structure throw in

463
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,800
your old your own domain

464
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,000
and of course

465
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,959
your uh your employees your users you

466
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,240
know all of us uh are probably guilty of

467
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,399
this that you you're sharing stuff on

468
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
linkedin uh you know organization have

469
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
got job ads out there which will reveal

470
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,800
technologies

471
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,320
all of this kind of

472
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,880
uh open source intelligence gathering

473
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,120
again can give you an indication of the

474
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,800
cloud apps that are in use by an

475
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,000
organization

476
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,160
and then you can start giving them a bit

477
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,279
of a bash okay

478
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,279
wait a second

479
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,120
so we need also to ask a few more

480
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
questions such as

481
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,000
um what are we planning to achieve we

482
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,759
need to think like threat actors and and

483
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:54,639
think

484
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,440
uh in that mindset so again what are we

485
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,959
planning to achieve what's the what's

486
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,279
the posture how can we minimize it

487
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,680
why are we targeting us of course why

488
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,760
are we doing this uh what is our

489
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,679
business goals what are technologies

490
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,439
being used sso and other identity

491
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,919
providers knowledge sharing platforms

492
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,799
like sharepoint or atlassian or whatnot

493
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,760
for example one of the key things to to

494
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,640
check out and test and verify is that

495
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,720
whether our business uses exchange

496
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
on-prem or 365 and how do you do that

497
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,919
there's a specific realm link

498
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
that you can use while trying to access

499
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,679
oh owa

500
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,000
that will be redirecting whether to an

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,400
adfs connector if it's on-prem or the

502
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,280
365 sign in if it's in fact in 365 so

503
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,880
that allows us to understand whether the

504
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,799
organization is in fact living in the

505
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,360
cloud using 365 or not using on-prem

506
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
adfs and whatnot

507
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,720
so making it easy for thread actors

508
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,760
um

509
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,039
you probably can't hide the fact that

510
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,440
you're using cloud applications but

511
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,039
okay we need to

512
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,280
we need to make things uh harder for

513
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
them okay we need to take cloud security

514
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,880
seriously

515
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:05,600
so

516
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,280
of course we can't hide any banners we

517
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,679
can't hide any titles responses missing

518
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,840
signing page i mean like

519
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,600
it is what it is right

520
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,480
but

521
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,919
we need to make sure that only

522
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,200
authorized users have access to a

523
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,919
specific limited amount of data for a

524
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,080
specific amount of time

525
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
in order to reduce that

526
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
so to speak like we said last radius uh

527
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
we need to make sure that everything is

528
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
well defined and well contained

529
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,799
now configurations should be set to fit

530
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,160
to purpose and control access to

531
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,720
potentially sensitive data as i said and

532
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,039
exercise care on not over sharing when i

533
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,400
think about the data that is being

534
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
shared it's supposed to be online or not

535
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,320
it's supposed to be internal or not

536
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,960
and if on that platform or not

537
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,440
so at the end individuals as we know

538
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,280
could help themselves and organizations

539
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,120
by uh being security aware by protecting

540
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,720
the credentials with all sorts of

541
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
password managers

542
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,360
being uh like i said aware uh avoiding

543
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,760
oversharing and not storing any

544
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,720
sensitive

545
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,640
data credentials or what not on personal

546
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
devices or services such as for example

547
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,520
if someone says an api key of aws in

548
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,000
slack because it makes their life easier

549
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,160
that's not the probably best idea to to

550
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,120
do

551
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,000
um

552
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,320
also we need to make sure that api keys

553
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,320
are limited and we know how to store

554
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,039
them

555
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
uh ips are trimmed down and not being

556
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,320
publicly

557
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,679
uh mentioning

558
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,559
um

559
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
github or any other git

560
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,880
solution cicd

561
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,200
fix up make sure that you don't have any

562
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
api keys or secrets in your code

563
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,840
cool so some examples uh

564
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,000
just gonna throw it out there

565
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,640
if it says internal only

566
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,039
that's not stopping anyone coming in uh

567
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,799
okay the uh this this was uh the sort of

568
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,440
initial result of looking at some

569
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,000
service desk type applications

570
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
um

571
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
and the number of service desk

572
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
applications that had links that said

573
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
internal use only or you know uh

574
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,400
even when it goes so far as to say

575
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,159
double check these settings so the

576
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,559
articles can only be viewed by agents uh

577
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,520
okay and sure enough it's publicly

578
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
accessible anyone can go clicking in

579
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
there so a very very clear example of

580
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,159
misconfiguration and i'd go so far as to

581
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,600
say that

582
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,400
if somebody is looking at the exposure

583
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,720
of your organization and it says

584
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
internal use only you're pretty much

585
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,919
going to skip everything else on the

586
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,600
page and drill straight into this i mean

587
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,200
it's it's it's inviting trouble uh okay

588
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,520
and misconfiguration from a perspective

589
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,200
uh this this bottom left corner there

590
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
from jenkins

591
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,280
so it's a development type environment

592
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,080
when

593
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,120
you have

594
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,440
the ability to perform administration

595
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,240
and and operations on there again it as

596
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,120
soon as you visit that that service and

597
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,760
you see something like that uh it's it's

598
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,799
just

599
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
yeah it's just incredible really okay

600
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,280
there were countless countless examples

601
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,039
of this uh and again you know having uh

602
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,559
having quite

603
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,120
interesting documents that that reveal

604
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,919
internal configurations or uh the way

605
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,480
that you go about things you know it's

606
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,280
it's

607
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,080
super obvious uh and any kind of

608
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,159
confidentiality marker i mean these are

609
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,280
the kinds of things that people have

610
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
been google talking for for years uh

611
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,200
it's it's just a wealth of information

612
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,600
to be had

613
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,000
so

614
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
as we talk about it about oversharing

615
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,320
organizations face a lot of problems for

616
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,760
what we're showing both internally and

617
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,039
externally so

618
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,200
um as i said not everyone needs access

619
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,080
to everything all the time when exposed

620
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,880
entity exposed externally this could be

621
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,280
used by any sort of threat actors and

622
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,120
oversharing could be done in all sorts

623
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,559
of ways such as

624
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,039
a well-intentioned data sharing that

625
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,159
should have been internal only okay and

626
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,120
while

627
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,480
in the case of

628
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,679
vendors

629
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
this could be a huge amount of pain and

630
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
trouble uh links to otherwise unindexed

631
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,120
data being widely shared and web calls

632
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,000
taking nuggets and just indexing

633
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,280
all over the place

634
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,360
uh individuals as jason already

635
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,039
mentioned are posting details about

636
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,799
their work on social media hey i

637
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,880
developed this new api feature

638
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,240
look at me and

639
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
that is a pain

640
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,919
and uh data being stored outside of the

641
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,080
organization's controls such as devices

642
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,199
services and whatnot

643
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,799
uh more examples uh so

644
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,440
over sharing so yeah absolutely so over

645
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,320
sharing

646
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,400
can be at an organizational level so

647
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,039
you're sharing information which

648
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,880
really probably is for internal

649
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,880
consumption or it's only for

650
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,400
perhaps for uh

651
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,720
um for viewing by select by select

652
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,880
people so when you just throw it out

653
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,840
there

654
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,600
and anybody and everybody can access it

655
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,039
it's just a case of whether they get to

656
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,919
it or not that's not so good so

657
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,480
there were countless examples of where

658
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,760
um perhaps internal infrastructure uh

659
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,360
and the way that perhaps you're doing

660
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,520
things internally are exposed so again

661
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,760
on you know sort of individually these

662
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,440
things might not be so bad when you

663
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
think of a threat actor that's uh that's

664
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,440
conducting some recon that's looking to

665
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,360
target your organization

666
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,200
any of these small pieces of information

667
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,919
can then help them either craft a decent

668
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,159
law to uh to target individuals at your

669
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
organization uh or it gives them an idea

670
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,799
of where to go once they're in um so you

671
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,799
know we've got examples here that uh

672
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,000
that provide internal ip details okay

673
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,159
yeah is that interesting yeah sort of

674
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,279
maybe you know when they talk about

675
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,520
password managers being used and where

676
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,799
that password manager data file is kept

677
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,720
okay well now we're starting to actually

678
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,840
provide details that if someone were to

679
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
compromise your network they know

680
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,200
exactly where to start going and looking

681
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,440
for for the for the real treasure i

682
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,120
guess okay

683
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
and also

684
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,840
listing

685
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,080
listing details of applications that

686
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,880
you're using so providing screenshots

687
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,960
internal screenshots that include a list

688
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,240
of all the apps that you're using

689
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,400
internally so again when you think of

690
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,279
the process of reconnaissance it's quite

691
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,520
an iterative process you you find out

692
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,559
some stuff

693
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,400
then you go off and you dig into that

694
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,159
and then you find some more and then you

695
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,919
come back and you can dig into that so

696
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,919
it allows you to kind of really build up

697
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,840
uh quite a nice picture of what's going

698
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,320
on internally

699
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,720
from uh from an external perspective you

700
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,520
know that's uh again pretty interesting

701
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,120
stuff so if i'm targeting an

702
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,559
organization one of the first things i

703
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:49,679
might do

704
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,720
is uh is perhaps determine you know what

705
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,480
domains they're using what ip ranges

706
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,240
have they got allocated you know

707
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,799
sort of uh build out that uh that sort

708
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,400
of picture

709
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
of their external exposure now you make

710
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,720
life easy for us if you're sharing

711
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,200
articles that have also got that kind of

712
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,919
information it may well be that some of

713
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:14,720
these ip ranges are you know they're not

714
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,360
actually assigned to you as such you're

715
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,960
using them but perhaps they wouldn't

716
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,080
show up on a normal search so again

717
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,480
exposing data which is very useful to uh

718
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
to a threat actor

719
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,760
and

720
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,320
organizational structure so here we have

721
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,440
uh we have a really helpful uh post you

722
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,640
know it just says uh company directory

723
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,320
you know brad was the author did i find

724
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,919
it helpful absolutely brad thank you

725
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:40,960
very much

726
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,880
so what we've got here is a nice

727
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,440
spreadsheet viewable using office online

728
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,279
so i didn't even have to have office

729
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,279
installed great

730
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,600
and it includes the

731
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,679
internal contact details for everybody

732
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,679
across the entire organization

733
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,799
so yeah okay what can i do with that

734
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,400
well hi brad it's dave the ceo and i'm

735
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,440
currently in geneva and my password

736
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,760
isn't letting me in please can you reset

737
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,279
it to insomniac okay it's it's this kind

738
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,080
of information that's uh that allows a

739
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,720
social engineer or a threat actor to to

740
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
have a great idea of what's going on to

741
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,320
be able to throw in

742
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
pieces of information which might then

743
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,919
convince a an unsuspecting user or

744
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,840
employee of your organization

745
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,080
to then grant some other access

746
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,960
cool

747
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,080
credentials i mean people aren't really

748
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,679
posting stuff on sites that say

749
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,159
public i mean like the clues there if

750
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,880
you are if you're using a publicly

751
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,559
viewable uh cloud service to uh to keep

752
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,360
notes based on your organization perhaps

753
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,840
keep

754
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,440
credentials uh particularly

755
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,080
for web servers and uh social media

756
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,200
accounts so these types of examples were

757
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,919
coming up uh as used by probably

758
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,799
marketing departments uh and and and

759
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,480
similar types of people so not

760
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,640
necessarily security savvy not

761
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
necessarily technically savvy uh they're

762
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,880
obviously making lives easy for

763
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
themselves but in the same time they're

764
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,400
oversharing making it easy for everyone

765
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,400
else

766
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,399
so

767
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,640
are you being too helpful

768
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,440
i hope not so of course

769
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,039
there's absolutely a need for some

770
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
organizations to share knowledge okay it

771
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,840
goes without saying if you're a software

772
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,760
vendor a hardware vendor you know uh

773
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
any any organization you you are going

774
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,279
to have documentation that you want to

775
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,039
share with your customers i guess the

776
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,520
question you have to ask is

777
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,960
does everybody in the whole world need

778
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,120
to know what we're going to share you

779
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,440
know can we limit that information to

780
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,559
perhaps

781
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,440
just verified customers you know perhaps

782
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,960
we have some kind of customer log on or

783
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,320
something and again the examples here

784
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,480
so i'm not going to name any names

785
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,399
absolutely that would be terrible but uh

786
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:05,760
point of sale

787
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,440
vendors the

788
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,880
little hardware device pin pad type guys

789
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,279
uh for some reason they love to uh

790
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,120
to share the details of

791
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,760
the passwords and the key presses used

792
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,240
to get into the menu on those devices

793
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,559
so again that's quite useful information

794
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,000
if you want to start messing around with

795
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,039
something

796
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,320
does everyone need to know that or

797
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,240
should that just be shared with with

798
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,640
specific users of that and again

799
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,640
providing perhaps uh

800
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,360
some internal knowledge that uh

801
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,080
is shared externally that can be taken

802
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,919
advantage of so there are multiple

803
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,440
examples of where

804
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,600
a helpdesk article was telling

805
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,240
users of that organization to

806
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,399
oh yeah connect to this when it comes up

807
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,399
with a certificate warning just to click

808
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:53,919
ignore or hey we use uh you know we use

809
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,120
any desk

810
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,039
so if someone asks you to provide them

811
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,440
with the number this is what you do so

812
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,799
of course then as a threat actor i'm

813
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,000
thinking cool

814
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,480
so i'm gonna i'm gonna target your users

815
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,399
they already know that if they see

816
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,399
something like this you know this nice

817
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,799
red alert that they can safely ignore

818
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,320
that because there's help desk articles

819
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
that tell them to do it you know when i

820
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,840
ask them to install some remote

821
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,320
administration yes some wrote access

822
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,640
software they're like oh yeah cool i do

823
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
that all the time so again does it

824
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,799
really need to be shared externally or

825
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:26,640
are you you know kind of stitching

826
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,120
yourself up

827
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,080
cool so with that in mind um

828
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,520
there's tons of information out there

829
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,360
and of course we always tend to think

830
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,520
like oh you know got to read pages and

831
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,440
pages of stuff when doing recon okay but

832
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,760
don't forget that video content and

833
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,080
images can also be a great source of

834
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,000
information so

835
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,600
when you're looking at

836
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,760
a lot of this content there's there's

837
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,520
often little bits in the background or

838
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,480
maybe

839
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,799
right up in your face which uh which you

840
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,480
know can be really helpful

841
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,640
when looking at video content

842
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,840
which is something that you know many uh

843
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,679
sort of support desk type people will

844
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,600
share

845
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,360
that pause button is going to super help

846
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,679
you out when it comes to finding often

847
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,640
overlooked details

848
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,080
so

849
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,520
in this example

850
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,679
again this was an internal support video

851
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,880
it was provided uh to help other

852
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,120
administrators of the product out but

853
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
again this is not a product that would

854
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
be be used externally this is very much

855
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,159
an internal video

856
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,480
so straight up you know what does this

857
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,440
tell us uh okay it's it's mildly

858
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,279
interesting but we get an idea of the

859
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,559
applications that are being used

860
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,480
internally so perhaps we can use that to

861
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,720
to perhaps steer the type of the type of

862
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,240
payload you know the type of threat we

863
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,159
might try and send to one of those users

864
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,559
okay we also know that perhaps the the

865
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,480
av engine that they're using you know

866
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,120
maybe then that can help us with our

867
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,000
sort of pre-attack planning uh help us

868
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,480
come up with uh with a sort of method of

869
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,480
testing what we're gonna do uh prior to

870
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,440
doing it

871
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,159
uh browser you know the fact that you

872
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,799
have all of these uh all these bookmarks

873
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,240
again they give us an indication of

874
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,480
what's going on internally so all cool

875
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,679
stuff

876
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,559
now in this particular video

877
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:18,720
one password pops up on screen

878
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,440
and the the narrator of the video

879
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,840
tells the uh the other uh the other

880
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,880
support guys hey yep log into one

881
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,000
password

882
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,840
grab the master password okay

883
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,640
again

884
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,799
we haven't got access to one password

885
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,399
but knowing that it's in use knowing

886
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:37,519
that it's out there that could be

887
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,600
beneficial later on in our attack uh

888
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,120
okay we know that there's a universal

889
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,679
logon or a master password that's used

890
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,559
on their product so again that gives us

891
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:48,159
something to perhaps target and look for

892
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,720
later uh the fact then we have

893
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,480
a an account

894
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,880
and we have the password length

895
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,039
okay maybe we could use that but again

896
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,200
these are these are very small details

897
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,480
tucked away in a video

898
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,600
that that can help us to to formulate a

899
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,320
plan when it comes to actually attacking

900
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,600
so

901
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,960
another example of you know sort of when

902
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,480
sort of video and image analysis comes

903
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,640
in handy we don't always have to think

904
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,200
of ourselves as bad guys we can be good

905
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,440
so perhaps you're doing some threat

906
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,039
tracking or similar

907
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
and again applying the same logic to the

908
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,600
uh to the to the task

909
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,320
so

910
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,799
being able to uh to pause when someone's

911
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,080
filling a form

912
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,159
um so you know hey this is an example of

913
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,720
how you log on to this service cool that

914
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,200
form auto field pops up for a fraction

915
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,840
of a second as they start to type in

916
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,039
whatever credentials they're logging in

917
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,679
with so again we can we can pause at

918
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,919
that point use that to extract some

919
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,440
interesting indicators

920
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,279
and my personal favorite the browser

921
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,640
address bar

922
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,840
so again

923
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,360
someone's demonstrating something in a

924
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,559
video

925
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,640
the browser's open they hit the address

926
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,880
bar just as they're about to start

927
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,919
typing the the autofill kills yeah it

928
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,720
jumps in and reveals their dirty secrets

929
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,440
so

930
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,519
you know on the left hand side there you

931
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,720
can see

932
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,720
perhaps some of the sites that they they

933
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,320
frequent

934
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,080
the blurriness of course is because

935
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,760
these screen grabs are from video

936
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,440
content you know but on the right hand

937
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,559
side here we have perhaps uh details of

938
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,120
a potential threat actor or threat group

939
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,039
which is interesting

940
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,200
we can see in caps there that they are

941
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,919
interested in nudes potentially skin

942
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:31,840
colored tights or something i don't know

943
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,360
and also we have a local site which

944
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,960
could give us an indication of where

945
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,440
that threat is located so it's almost

946
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,760
the same logic applies to when

947
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,080
investigating a an organization or

948
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,000
investigating a threat actor

949
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,440
yeah super cool

950
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,960
okay

951
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,279
and finally

952
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,120
any any of those kind of pop-ups that

953
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,519
you see uh coming out of the system tray

954
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,840
um you know great example of a video

955
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
that a thragster was sharing uh where

956
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,679
they would they were conducting some

957
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,440
kind of payment card fraud

958
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,840
and you know practicing good opsec they

959
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
wanted to fire up their vpn client but

960
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,560
on screen for a moment it pops up with

961
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,879
their real ip so again being able to

962
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:14,000
look at

963
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,079
look at those little details uh can

964
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,960
often give you some real good stuff

965
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,918
thanks uh enough for the part that we

966
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,800
all love accommodations so

967
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,960
as part of recommendations

968
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
you need to be we need to remember that

969
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,280
you need to be extra cautious regarding

970
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,199
oversharing both as an individual and

971
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,520
organization make sure that you know

972
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,918
that what's going on and and should you

973
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,320
be should it be online and whatnot you

974
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,800
need to audit the existing applications

975
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,040
and data access permissions how did it

976
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,879
all come together do we need these

977
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,480
accounts on this platform

978
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,918
do we need actually this platform um

979
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,679
combined with it and

980
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,359
information security

981
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,040
cloud-based assets and secrets needs to

982
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,880
be managed monitored and protected

983
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,359
either by um

984
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,680
secrets uh keeping platform secure

985
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,240
secrets uh platform and whatnot

986
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,200
while

987
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,320
we know exactly at any given moment how

988
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,160
many cloud assets do we have with there

989
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,480
is a as a cloud environment as a cloud

990
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,119
provider such as for example we know

991
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,800
how much money we pay for resources

992
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,280
cloud resources on a daily basis what

993
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
happens if the uh if the bill is

994
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,079
actually

995
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:26,160
10 times higher because someone broke in

996
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,400
and a crypto miner on one of the vms and

997
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,320
that's it you know so you need to be in

998
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,960
control all the time

999
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
when sharing invitations are links to

1000
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
content you need to limit them both in

1001
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,839
time and to the intended recipients such

1002
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,320
as you know exactly who's been accessing

1003
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
the data and for how long

1004
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,560
and while auditing you need to make sure

1005
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,800
that you don't overlook the simple stuff

1006
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,200
don't take anything for granted um

1007
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
exposed data on every publicly

1008
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,520
accessible site could be a valuable

1009
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
troll of

1010
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,520
of intelligence for threat actors who

1011
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,240
just try to attack your business

1012
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,680
stop domain scanning and brute forcing

1013
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,160
could reveal uh interesting hosts so you

1014
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,440
need to make sure that you know your

1015
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,560
footprint

1016
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,040
check out how many uh

1017
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
dns records do you have in your on your

1018
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,599
domains are they still needed how these

1019
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,480
c names a records whatever

1020
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,480
are they still needed do you still

1021
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
uh need them for your daily operation

1022
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,760
because

1023
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,560
if the sub domain is dead potentially if

1024
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,400
it's still pointing it could be the same

1025
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,960
one as jason's talk about of a potential

1026
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,040
subname and hijacking

1027
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,920
now

1028
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
and and this is of course a bit market

1029
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,079
marketing wise image and video analysis

1030
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:39,760
allows often overlooked items to be

1031
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,079
found so basically every video and every

1032
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,520
image that you release as an

1033
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,440
organization could be used against you

1034
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,119
with these tiny bits that we've just

1035
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,520
seen that could reveal potential

1036
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,079
services and information about your

1037
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,599
organization and users so

1038
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,240
at the end we need to make sure that

1039
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,599
is there need to know

1040
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,400
okay who has access who needs to know if

1041
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,119
there is a need to know

1042
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,079
okay okay and for that part

1043
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
do we have any questions

1044
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,520
well first of all thank you very much

1045
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,280
for a great talk dvd and jason please

1046
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,400
give them a big round of applause

1047
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,560
[Applause]

1048
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,078
yeah there any questions for them

1049
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
thank you for the awesome talk um what

1050
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,119
you talked about is usually the first

1051
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:37,280
step the initial step of a social

1052
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,680
engineering attack or phishing attack or

1053
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,760
maybe a red teaming operation

1054
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
do you have actual real world examples

1055
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,720
where

1056
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,560
this kind of

1057
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,000
attacks or

1058
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,480
i mean initial steps were used in a

1059
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,960
global attack

1060
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,920
on a global scale

1061
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,079
i'm not going to name any any sort of

1062
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,960
event or cases but this in fact happens

1063
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,680
all the time either by crime groups

1064
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,079
ransomware operators and whatnot this is

1065
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,760
their wedding but this is what they're

1066
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
trying to do they map up the scale of

1067
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,680
the organization they make up the

1068
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,680
weaknesses they map out the information

1069
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,960
being shared

1070
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,560
who to target whether it's personal

1071
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:23,280
accounts or any other thing and think

1072
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,720
about that i know that a certain person

1073
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,720
works at a certain organization and i

1074
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
also found their personal email now i'm

1075
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,640
gonna target them through the personal

1076
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,760
email because

1077
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,320
we know that these businesses and emails

1078
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,760
are much more protected than the usual

1079
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,079
ones we have no artificial mechanisms

1080
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,720
and whatnot but on the personal level

1081
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,480
how many personal emails accounts are in

1082
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
fact

1083
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,359
protected against potential phishing

1084
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,920
so this actually happens continuously on

1085
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,240
and on and on

1086
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,920
thank you yeah i'll check a couple of

1087
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,599
words on actually it's given me time to

1088
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,079
think um so yeah i mean that's that's

1089
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,000
always the trouble with with the course

1090
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,440
recon and that kind of pre-attack

1091
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,720
activity you know as as you know yeah

1092
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,240
it's it's difficult to see and to

1093
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,240
quantify isn't it um

1094
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,119
so

1095
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,960
yeah and that's always that part you

1096
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,400
know when you think back to kill chain

1097
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,320
which was super fashionable a few years

1098
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,320
back um that was always at that point in

1099
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,440
the kill train it was really difficult

1100
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,280
to see what's going on and to get an

1101
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,480
understanding

1102
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,839
i would i would suggest kind of

1103
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:22,000
anecdotally that

1104
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,240
it it sort of seems in some cases

1105
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,480
ransomware operators uh

1106
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,920
are definitely definitely having a good

1107
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,160
a good sort of recon phase

1108
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,200
and i think perhaps you know when you

1109
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,880
look at some of the data that is

1110
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,160
overshared and when you look at some of

1111
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
those misconfigurations i think it's

1112
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,680
very easy to see that those types of

1113
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,119
operator

1114
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,000
would

1115
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,560
know to go looking and could very easily

1116
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,359
take advantage of it so

1117
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,280
yeah i think to answer the question or

1118
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,440
to completely skeet around it this is

1119
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,440
super difficult to know who's doing what

1120
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,960
recon and of course everyone's being

1121
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
scanned all the time by everyone good

1122
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,800
and bad um

1123
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,560
but that's it when when you have got

1124
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,079
this kind of stuff floating around out

1125
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,000
there it's it's literally a matter of

1126
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,640
time before it's used so you know all

1127
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,800
those credentials um that are being

1128
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,480
shared by individuals

1129
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
as it happens some of those some of

1130
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,760
those posts

1131
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,440
uh and some of that information that was

1132
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,319
shared it was years old uh and so it's

1133
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,040
safe to say that's long been burnt um

1134
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,560
why they haven't gone back and cleaned

1135
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,839
up their own

1136
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,599
their own sort of oversharing i don't

1137
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:28,560
know

1138
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,240
but that's it it's probably just a

1139
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,879
matter of time

1140
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,240
any more questions for them

1141
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,520
um so you provided some recommendations

1142
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,599
but you also have tangible actions that

1143
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,240
companies can take

1144
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,960
um yeah absolutely um when it comes to

1145
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,599
you know tangible actions would be

1146
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,640
to

1147
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,640
for iit and ice and information security

1148
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,000
to work together to map out the entire

1149
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,560
assets to work with every department

1150
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,640
leader to ask them specifically on a

1151
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,720
one-on-one conversation

1152
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,040
are there any sas applications that you

1153
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
use with your own personal credentials

1154
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,319
that i'm not aware of

1155
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,640
cool let's let's talk about it

1156
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,520
and start minimizing the the entire uh

1157
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,720
applications and permissions and

1158
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
connecting it all together because

1159
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,720
this is in fact the pain point this is

1160
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,640
in fact the potential blast release that

1161
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,720
could happen and and of course awareness

1162
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,240
and and making sure that it's it's a bit

1163
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,319
about governance about how information

1164
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,839
security actually controls the business

1165
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,000
and how fully aware on top of that i

1166
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,160
would definitely recommend on

1167
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,880
getting uh incident response procedures

1168
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,400
well tightened and sharpened at any

1169
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,520
given moment

1170
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,880
distant response teams should know

1171
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,440
exactly what to look for in what systems

1172
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,560
at any given moment um and of course not

1173
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,720
to delve into that but

1174
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,800
it goes on and on that's

1175
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,720
and so would you say that cyber

1176
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,040
awareness is a huge factor in this

1177
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,440
absolutely i mean like at the end since

1178
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,680
the responsibility relies at the end use

1179
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,560
of every organization we need to make

1180
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,200
sure that sometimes not the the less

1181
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,160
technical personnel will know how to act

1182
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,000
online what to share what not to share

1183
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,079
according to company procedures and

1184
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,160
whatnot i think awareness is a key

1185
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,839
factor when it comes to

1186
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,240
uh how users maintain and keep their

1187
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,560
passwords and not sharing it around

1188
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,599
or

1189
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,079
should they disregard with emails coming

1190
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,599
from i know

1191
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,680
a guy that

1192
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,319
talks like the help desk you know it's

1193
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:45,839
being aware is is a key factor

1194
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,640
thank you thanks

1195
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,960
any more questions

1196
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,880
while i'm completely sympathetic with

1197
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,560
recommendations

1198
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,200
uh did you ever

1199
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,400
implement those recommend

1200
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,160
recommendations in a larger scale

1201
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,040
company yourself have you ever done this

1202
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,480
how did you do this

1203
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,880
so it's not easy it's not a process that

1204
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,800
you know it's uh

1205
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,560
you can finish up in a week

1206
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,880
procedures and processes takes a very

1207
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,440
long time to to address and of course to

1208
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,520
map out i'm not disrespecting it at all

1209
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,240
and i'm fully aware of that

1210
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
on a personal level i've been working in

1211
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,680
a large scale organization and you know

1212
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,920
things in motion could take years to to

1213
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,880
come and

1214
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,040
into fusion

1215
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,160
and once you're through you have to

1216
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,319
start again because your sphere has been

1217
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:42,560
completely changed exactly so

1218
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,119
it needs to be done hand in hand it is

1219
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,280
information security at any given moment

1220
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,800
specifically about organizations that

1221
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,839
have

1222
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:51,680
major production systems that can never

1223
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,440
be done at any given moment but also

1224
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,680
information sharing and whatnot so

1225
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,560
of course

1226
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,319
it's a long process but at the end we

1227
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:01,280
need to squish the the major bugs you

1228
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,800
need to make sure that

1229
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,680
uh

1230
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,560
the big issues are being sold asap

1231
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,599
can you give some numbers for your

1232
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,119
company you worked for

1233
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,000
um

1234
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,760
we can talk about language numbers

1235
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,920
devices numbers web pages we can talk

1236
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,000
about it later i'm talking about

1237
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,760
um

1238
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,119
yeah a few thousand computers

1239
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,760
um we can catch up

1240
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,240
later on

1241
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,560
thank you

1242
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,000
okay i'm gonna throw some more words on

1243
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,319
that one as well um so so yeah

1244
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,000
absolutely

1245
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,359
of course you know

1246
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:36,960
i think often we're thinking of this

1247
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,319
from a super large scale and all the

1248
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,640
rest of it um but probably one of the

1249
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,000
most important things that we can do as

1250
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:44,319
security professionals is to increase

1251
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,160
awareness in general and and that's not

1252
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,240
just you know talking to like-minded

1253
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:49,920
people or

1254
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,640
you know saying to security teams oh you

1255
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,319
need to bash all your users now i think

1256
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,319
that's also a case of sharing sharing

1257
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,960
your knowledge and your expertise uh and

1258
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,160
some sort of guidance um with with the

1259
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,079
people around you in your immediate life

1260
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:06,800
you know so you know talk to your family

1261
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,359
uh you know help them understand the

1262
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,920
types of risks and dangers you know and

1263
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,760
it's almost like all these little steps

1264
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,480
if

1265
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,560
if everyone's more aware you know when

1266
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,560
you can actually get down to you know

1267
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,079
that person that has no interest in

1268
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,960
technology or you know has has no

1269
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,200
interest in security or you know what's

1270
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,040
that what's that all about uh you know

1271
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,520
if you can get through to them that

1272
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,800
there's just a few little things that

1273
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,880
they can do to uh to help protect

1274
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:33,920
themselves

1275
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,160
that then in turn will help protect

1276
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
their employer and their organization

1277
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,200
and you know it kind of perhaps then

1278
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,560
echoes up

1279
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,280
so absolutely apply everything from you

1280
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,200
know almost from the top down but i

1281
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,079
think just help people in general uh to

1282
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,480
just become a bit more security savvy um

1283
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,359
you know

1284
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,400
invariably now everyone uh no matter how

1285
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,440
uh

1286
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,920
how sort of old school you are or how

1287
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,760
much you hate technology everyone's got

1288
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,839
technology at home everyone has to use

1289
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,920
technology for banking and shopping and

1290
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,000
all the rest of it everyone's probably

1291
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,440
got hundreds of passwords uh well okay

1292
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,560
some people have got hundreds of

1293
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,960
passwords probably a lot of people have

1294
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,880
got one password but and that's kind of

1295
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,000
the point if you can get through to

1296
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,839
those people what

1297
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,599
what they learn in that sort of

1298
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,560
throwaway conversation uh over a pint

1299
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,480
can then you know then make everyone

1300
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,560
else's uh job a lot easier perhaps

1301
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:33,440
thanks

1302
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,520
any last questions for today and jason

1303
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:42,160
well thank you very much again and

1304
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,520
please give them another round of

1305
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:47,640
applause thank you very much
