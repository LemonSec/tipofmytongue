[Music]

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,480
so we're going to talk about cyber

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,039
terrorism and the energy sector

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,119
in a way to try to get cyber experts and

5
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,439
lawmakers to collaborate better that's

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,960
the goal

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,279
so i had to summarize 87 pages of

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,439
research down into 30 somat slides so

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,199
there's way more involved obviously so

10
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,238
we're going to talk the agenda we're

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,160
going to talk about what the problem is

12
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,920
key terms literature

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,440
early research outlook from where i've

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,760
gotten thus far some cases in research

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,920
and what's next and a special surprise

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,559
in the end a little tribute

17
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,879
so

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,360
who am i i have a little slide for that

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
so i'm a full-time faculty member at

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,840
university global i also practice law

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,000
i've been licensed for coming on six

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,199
years now

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,359
and i consult in cyber security i've

24
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,480
been in it for the last 26 years total

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,840
uh who remembers 486 dx computers

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,360
first one i built

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,799
yes i was wondering like what is this

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:11,200
dash 66 thing minnows processor my

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,680
mother tricked me so

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
i've been doing this for a little while

31
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,119
so i caused my little eye candy page

32
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,520
some degrees and stuff i've have i have

33
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,200
a couple degrees finishing up a

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,799
doctorate right now which is actually

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,000
part of what the study is about

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,759
coincidentally

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:26,720
have

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,920
done a little bit everything i'm a

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,600
military veteran

40
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,839
i have worked in the energy sector so

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
backwards in time after i finished

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,680
undergrad after military went and worked

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,600
for the energy sector then worked for a

44
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,439
hospital doing i.t for a while then went

45
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
back to the energy company in my job

46
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,640
there which is actually tied to this

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
topic my job was to make sure the gov

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,159
that they were complying with federal

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,040
regulations specifically nerc silk the

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,880
regulations that ties the energy company

51
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,640
towards making sure it's secure

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,600
i did the policies procedures as well as

53
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,880
implemented the actual systems

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,360
themselves

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
and a little bit of stuff

56
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,439
so what is the problem

57
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,759
obviously problem's pretty obvious

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,679
cyber attacks are on the rise that's the

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,920
biggest part of it and there has been a

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,239
fundamental breakdown between

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,000
cyber security experts as well as

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,599
lawmakers when it comes to drafting

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,720
these laws

64
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,400
that's the overarching problem that

65
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
exists although

66
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,959
there is obviously a need we see it from

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,879
the cyber security side of the house

68
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
lawmakers tend to have the they tend to

69
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,200
take the approach of

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,800
let's address how we feel we should

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,040
address and then ask everybody second

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,640
versus everybody being at the table to

73
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
start off with

74
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,440
i know this actually was involved in

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,599
some drafting of policies back in the

76
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,640
day

77
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,160
they seriously would draft the draft of

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
legislation and then send it to experts

79
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
afterwards for their opinion and then

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,280
decide what opinion they want to take

81
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
before they publish the laws

82
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,879
the purpose of my study was to try to

83
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
explore the gaps that exist

84
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,879
between dealing with specifically

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,319
dealing with the irish the issue of

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,480
cyber terrorism itself and to try to

87
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,159
develop a framework to make it a little

88
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,239
bit better and easier for everybody to

89
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,879
talk and communicate

90
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,480
so before we get going we must discuss

91
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,560
some terminology

92
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,519
because there's a little bit of a

93
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,080
difference cyber crime cyber crime is

94
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,599
basically any crime that we're used to

95
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,040
hearing about just involving the

96
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
computer in short

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,040
and i put up a nice little image i

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,319
forgot where i got these from actually

99
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,879
having my notes but these are the top 20

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,640
countries that deal with cyber crime

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,159
then you have cyber war so different

102
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,080
between cyber war is basically there's a

103
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,920
state actor involved

104
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
which gets really muddling in the water

105
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,560
and i won't get down that that weed but

106
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,120
when you have state sponsored and state

107
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,040
there are two different things

108
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,360
say sponsors were for example we say

109
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,599
united states pays to pay citizens to go

110
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,640
and do things they count and stay

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,200
sponsored

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
and then we have cyber terrorism really

113
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,000
old slide but obviously it's risen since

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
then so type cyber terrorism versus

115
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
cyber warfare the biggest difference

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,799
between terrorism warfare has to do with

117
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,840
the gold

118
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
it's normally for terrorism you're

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,720
dealing with destruction and something

120
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,560
political involved that's the biggest

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,840
differentiation between the two

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,680
i think that's just the fbi's definition

123
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,560
out there so in comparison

124
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,280
cyber crime same thing traditional

125
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,160
so

126
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,639
say for example trespass everybody knows

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,800
what trespass is there's a version of

128
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
that when it comes to cyber the cyber

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,440
world as well which is on unauthorized

130
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
access to a computer

131
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
cyber war exact same thing as cyber

132
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,199
crime only there's a state involved in

133
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,040
cyber terrorism same thing only

134
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,479
different version of actors so pretty

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,479
much all the same basic stuff but

136
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
everybody views it as if it's different

137
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,360
still the same basic elements

138
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,720
so

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
question how many you work remotely

140
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,280
most of you

141
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
now

142
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,120
i mean you ever work remotely you're on

143
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,160
your computer and all of a sudden the

144
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,840
power goes out

145
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,600
you know anybody before

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,440
besides her

147
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,800
the first thing you think is what on

148
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,000
earth happen

149
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,840
and that's kind of what spun the idea of

150
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,759
doing the digging to this what happens

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,520
if it's not

152
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,000
a transistor balloon but something more

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,400
nefarious is going on that's what start

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,039
me doing this digging into this research

155
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,600
as it was uh i think two days ago

156
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
that cnn said that there were five

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,840
energy attacks against the us just two

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,919
days ago so they constantly happen

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,039
so

160
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,240
literature

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,720
cyber crime so this is a little bit of

162
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
history on some of the some of the work

163
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,360
has been done related to it in 1990 uk

164
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,520
published their computer misuse act

165
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,039
a lot of that a lot of things have

166
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,639
actually come from and globally have

167
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,120
been modeled off of what the uk has done

168
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,520
japan published one in 1999 as well

169
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,479
then fast forward a tad bit

170
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:00,560
we had canada canada pretty much modeled

171
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
theirs off the europeans as well

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
and then france did the same thing also

173
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
so pretty much everybody model fairs off

174
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
of what european did the european union

175
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,758
did

176
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,639
the russia federation they modified

177
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,960
their criminal code in 97 to include

178
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,319
cyber crime and pakistani in 2016

179
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,120
published a law that allowed it made it

180
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
easier for law enforcement to prosecute

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,199
but from research says a little bit

182
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
controversial because they didn't get

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,800
any input from anybody else including

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
the public sector they kind of did what

185
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,960
they wanted to do and then published it

186
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,880
and i did not have the us up there but

187
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,039
our sorry our criminal code started

188
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,680
modifying in these 70s 60s and 70s

189
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,960
related to it

190
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,239
well 70s and 80s rather

191
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,960
who's heard the budapest convention

192
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,240
anybody

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,199
yeah

194
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,199
it is the only cooperative agreement

195
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
where a country said we're going to work

196
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,440
together to try to combat cybercrime

197
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,759
that's only one exists until this day it

198
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,360
is the only thing that comes close to

199
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,400
dealing with the issue to this day

200
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,240
so conviction came down that said hey

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
let's break down some of these barriers

202
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,479
as it deals with um extraditing people

203
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:11,759
and getting cyber criminals held

204
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,280
accountable for the crimes they commit

205
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,599
in whatever country they're in

206
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,120
that's in short how the budapest

207
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,080
convention came to be

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,880
so cyber warfare

209
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,720
this is where it gets really interesting

210
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,720
because it's basically a cyber crime

211
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
that's occurring but

212
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,479
it's a state actor so if i for example

213
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,960
go in hacking to the energy company it's

214
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,880
considered to be a cyber crime

215
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
if say for example

216
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,599
let's make up a island never never land

217
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,840
island decides to the exact same thing

218
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,759
it's considered to be cyber war at that

219
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,800
point because of who's doing it

220
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
ultimately the exact same goal still

221
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,039
going to be the end but the after that's

222
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,039
what make the biggest difference as they

223
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:58,960
define here cyber war is a conflict

224
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,639
between states where precision and

225
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
proportion force is directed against

226
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
military and industrial targets key word

227
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
is industrial

228
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,840
for political economic or territorial

229
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,840
gain

230
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,319
terrorism

231
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,639
terrorism has been an issue globally for

232
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
a very very long time that's actually a

233
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,919
good chunk of

234
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,440
the research specifically dealt with

235
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,120
terrorism itself

236
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,720
but from a global perspective the uk and

237
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
the us are

238
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,919
pretty much the forerunners when it

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,759
comes to trying to combat terrorism from

240
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,240
a global front the us has taken upon

241
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,559
themselves to be the to be the the front

242
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,799
runner of that they self self proclaim

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,399
themselves on that one

244
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
uh despite there being a global

245
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,560
recognition for a need to come back

246
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,760
terrorism

247
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,680
there isn't a global cooperation as well

248
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
every country pretty much takes the

249
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,760
position that our job is to protect our

250
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
citizens and therefore we're going to

251
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
come back terrorism way we feel it

252
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,360
should be combative versus looking at it

253
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,760
for what it is which is a global issue

254
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,120
just because one country may get

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
attacked doesn't mean that that same

256
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,200
group won't attack another country so

257
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,560
it's a global problem it's not an

258
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
individual country problem which is part

259
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,599
of the argument that i make

260
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
then we get to cyber terrorism so cyber

261
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,440
terrorism gold is just like traditional

262
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,000
terrorism there is going to be some type

263
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
of political reason behind it generally

264
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,880
speaking the goal is still destruction

265
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
at the end of the day

266
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,560
there are a couple different ways to go

267
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,519
about it but cyber terrorism itself

268
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,519
became a little bit more complicated

269
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,399
when

270
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,279
terrorists started using the cyber world

271
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,200
to recruit

272
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,720
which comes up later on when it comes to

273
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
chatting so they would use things such

274
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,920
as propaganda via the internet and also

275
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
use the cyber and also use chat rooms in

276
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,920
order to recruit people to get them to

277
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,600
join the organization

278
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,839
so cyber terrorism is not just let me

279
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
attack your computer but it's also let

280
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
me recruit you to get to join a gazette

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
organization do whatever you want to do

282
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,399
as well

283
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
categories we have weapons of mass

284
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,360
destruction so who knew about the

285
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,600
chernobyl disaster of 1986. anybody

286
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,519
heard of that one yeah

287
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,959
that one was

288
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,680
indirectly caused because of cyber world

289
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,360
it was caused because of a computer

290
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,279
issue so that was the beginning of that

291
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,320
problem

292
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,399
we have weapons of mass destruction

293
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,440
destruction a distraction rather such as

294
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,079
fake news and propaganda

295
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,839
i think i've heard my fair share of the

296
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,320
phrase fake news over the last

297
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,920
four years now roughly uh

298
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,000
i've heard the phrase fake news more in

299
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,839
the last four years and i have my entire

300
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:46,959
life

301
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,240
we have then weapons of mass disruption

302
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
the idea behind disruption is to break

303
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
away your breakaway citizens access to

304
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,320
something

305
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
so it could be break away your access

306
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,800
towards water breakaway access towards

307
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,760
power

308
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,120
breakaway access towards the internet

309
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,040
itself

310
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,959
uh then you have your hybrid warfare

311
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
which is obviously a combination of all

312
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,519
the ones above and then something called

313
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,279
unlimited warfare

314
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,000
unlimited warfare is basically

315
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
no man's land have you ever seen the

316
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,920
movie mad max where everybody's on dares

317
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,519
is kind of chaotic that's that's the

318
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,160
equivalency of unlimited warfare no

319
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,680
holes bar everybody doing whatever you

320
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,600
want to do in the cyber world that's

321
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
unlimited warfare

322
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
alright legal system around cyber

323
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,440
terrorism

324
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,920
so united states the big overarching one

325
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,880
for that is united the u.s patriot act

326
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,399
extremely controversial

327
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,959
in some points um researchers actually

328
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,399
said that it was emotionally charged

329
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,320
when it was written because of some

330
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,279
incidents that have happened in the

331
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,880
united states

332
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,399
uh it obviously has brought a lot of

333
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,079
controversy on later on because it

334
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,600
pretty much can

335
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,760
how can i phrase this

336
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,320
the patriarch has been used as

337
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,480
justification for a lot of things that

338
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,360
the us wants to do we'll put it that way

339
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,320
india

340
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,560
we have the i.t act of 2000 which was

341
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,279
later made in 2008 which has tonight the

342
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,680
national cyber coordination center and

343
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,760
the indian cyber crime coordination

344
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,720
center

345
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,839
then europe

346
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,760
decided to do the european network of

347
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,440
information security agency anacia

348
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
and they addressed cyber security alone

349
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,160
as a level four in level five

350
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,680
issue cyber terms level four cyber

351
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,440
warfare is level five

352
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
so you imagine this five levels of this

353
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,240
equation

354
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
then you have the legal system around

355
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
the energy sector

356
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
so

357
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,279
the a lot of this is geared specifically

358
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,320
towards united states and it wasn't my

359
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,760
intent to

360
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,680
deal with just united states it's just

361
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,839
how things end up turning out a tad bit

362
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,920
when i started my study i reached out to

363
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,240
people in the energy sectors literally

364
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,839
across the world

365
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,760
getting responses back was a little bit

366
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,600
harder than finding people pretty good

367
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,880
at finding folks getting getting

368
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,200
communication back was pretty hard but i

369
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,040
have had some conversation with people

370
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
in different countries so i know that

371
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,839
the

372
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,079
the way the energy sectors are governed

373
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,399
in other countries is greatly different

374
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,800
it varies literally from one place to

375
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,160
another place within the exact same

376
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,200
region

377
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,160
so

378
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,079
that being said that does obviously

379
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,480
create some muddling in the water when

380
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,959
it comes to trying to address things

381
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
but the us uh

382
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,639
has been the one who's historically

383
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,399
actually started the ball rolling in

384
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,480
developing laws to

385
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
govern the way the energy sector works

386
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,880
in 84 ronald reagan came out with the

387
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,399
national syria national security

388
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,839
decision directive 145 that started the

389
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,360
ball rolling

390
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
in 1990

391
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
butch decided to further that it had

392
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
been on with director 42 which said

393
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,040
everybody need to coordinate this thing

394
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,800
coordinated effort

395
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,399
2011

396
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,320
president obama came in and pinned the

397
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
international security strategy for

398
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
cyberspace

399
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,560
and 2013 2015 he also passed a record

400
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,320
specifically geared towards critical

401
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,880
infrastructure and its protection which

402
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
brought in nerc silp

403
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,639
northern electric reliability commission

404
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,800
critical infrastructure protection is

405
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,199
what the acronym stands for has anybody

406
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,839
here ever heard of it

407
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,399
no one's heard of it okay

408
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:25,440
so

409
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
nerd silp is

410
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,560
when most people in the energy sector

411
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
uh run away from it's it's the scariest

412
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
thing in the world if you ask them

413
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,560
so nurse up is the body it's actually a

414
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,440
set of standards that the government

415
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,399
said that you have to comply with

416
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,399
the reason why most people run away from

417
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,920
that if they see it obviously you have

418
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
no choice but to deal with if you're

419
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,440
interested in your company the reason

420
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,360
why most people run away from it is

421
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
because of how strict it is

422
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,519
so for example

423
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,480
say for example an employee gets fired

424
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,079
most people fire employees on friday

425
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:00,959
right

426
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
you have 24 hours to remove the access

427
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,199
to every system if you don't you can get

428
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,519
final to 1 million dollars per day

429
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,440
of missing violation

430
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,760
uh let's see what else is in there

431
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,240
if you a person transfers to a different

432
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,199
department you have 30 days to remove

433
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,440
their access it from folders but 14 days

434
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,040
to remove their 7 or 14 since 14 14 to

435
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
remove their access to those systems

436
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,160
themselves

437
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
you have to do things such as it

438
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,240
requires you to have antivirus

439
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,680
protection endpoint protection on every

440
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,959
computer

441
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,880
that you must regularly and frequently

442
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,079
check up on

443
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,279
uh let's see

444
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,680
it it's extremely

445
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
extremely detailed in some cases

446
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:45,759
actually tells you what to do so for

447
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,839
example with uh with access you have to

448
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,000
have two fact authentication period if

449
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
you don't have it that's a violation

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,759
so if you're not heard of nerf self then

451
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,600
no one in here probably knows about what

452
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,759
happened to duke energy in

453
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:02,639
2019 it was 2019 they got fined 15

454
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,120
million dollars for violating that

455
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,839
so

456
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,680
that's how strict of a regulation it is

457
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,639
um

458
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,519
it has been used as the model by other

459
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,839
countries for their for how they should

460
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,079
do approach their um infrastructure for

461
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,880
mission sector and my job in the company

462
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
power company was to make sure we were

463
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
compliant with that

464
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
so i managed systems such as rsa for

465
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,120
example act directory was one of mine as

466
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,360
well i had endpoint protection uh group

467
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,519
policies my job was to make sure all

468
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
that stuff was compliant with nerf seal

469
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,000
made the company policies procedures

470
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,160
implemented those systems themselves not

471
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,839
all of it obviously i had

472
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,360
a total of six different systems i was

473
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,000
managing out of 13

474
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,240
out of 13 and fell under the purview

475
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
then do all the evidence for it give it

476
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,440
to the federal government and then go

477
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,839
and sit in front of them and testify

478
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,560
as

479
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,279
at full on hearing doing the audit

480
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,959
so

481
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,360
good old nurse

482
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,000
if you ever want to know how to

483
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,400
model yourself that if you okay who

484
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
knows of nist

485
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,839
this is

486
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
this was built off of miss so imagine

487
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,119
taking this and then put it giving you

488
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,199
steroids

489
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,959
yeah there we go that's about the best

490
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,480
way of describing it

491
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,520
all right who's heard of the

492
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,079
international criminal court

493
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,000
somebody yes

494
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,240
there has been a well first

495
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,359
international criminal court was

496
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,120
established because of roman statue and

497
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,240
article 1.

498
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,120
13 par 128 articles they only deal with

499
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,039
four different things genocide cries

500
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,679
against humanity war crimes and crimes

501
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,240
of aggression

502
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,520
there are 120 i think it's 126

503
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,960
or 28 126 tanks that i have signed of it

504
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,440
not all who have signed it have ratified

505
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
the united states did initially sign did

506
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,679
not ratify and

507
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,200
kind of tried to back away from it the

508
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
uk the other leader in the terrorism

509
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
world is fully signed and ratified

510
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,679
they're full on full state party at this

511
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,799
point

512
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,120
they were brought up because

513
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
there has been an extreme amount of push

514
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,480
to try to get

515
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,080
the icc to take on terrorism itself

516
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,480
they have refused to do it for a few

517
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
reasons one being they said that it

518
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,799
would overcrowd the courts if they bring

519
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,120
if they brought that in their purview

520
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,240
but

521
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
there was some there was a manual that

522
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,480
came out that gave ideas

523
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,840
of how

524
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,919
they could go about approaching it which

525
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,919
was the talent manual

526
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,480
your talent manual was a piece of

527
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
scholarly work that was

528
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,840
that i think about

529
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,480
20 or so people total over the course of

530
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,120
three years went into giving

531
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,640
their opinion on the state of the laws

532
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,039
that existed at that point in time as

533
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,679
they pertained to cyber warfare and

534
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,919
cyber terrorism itself

535
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,360
they came on the tiny mountains so as a

536
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,480
bunch of scholars did a bunch of

537
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,120
articles say hey you can apply this

538
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
stuff to what you already have if you

539
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,679
look at it from this approach

540
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:05,840
so if you look at

541
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
genocide in this way so we have we have

542
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
a person who breaches a reactor the

543
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,720
reactor then kills a bunch of people

544
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,640
why not call that genocide that's kind

545
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,960
of what italian manual did in a nutshell

546
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,240
unfortunately icc decided to reject this

547
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,520
adoption

548
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,320
uh they said that it and partly because

549
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,880
of the opinion aspect of it it's purely

550
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,760
opinion on how things could work

551
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
i said okay when i learned about this as

552
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,720
well i said well let's try doing a

553
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,080
different approach

554
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,559
let's not just give pure opinion let's

555
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,240
get some science behind this let's

556
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
actually do some studies maybe that'll

557
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,880
change somebody's mind

558
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
so what did i do

559
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,160
started researching

560
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,760
did some early research so i went and

561
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,600
sounded a question there and the

562
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,679
question there these were basically the

563
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,440
ideas behind the questionnaire itself

564
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,840
the questionnaire went out to

565
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
uh security experts that work in the

566
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,559
energy sector as well as law mark

567
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,039
lawmakers themselves tied towards these

568
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,400
topics the goal was to try to identify

569
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,640
gaps in the communication room for

570
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
improvement but i did a little bit

571
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,400
differently i also looked for what are

572
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,760
the issues from the technology's

573
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
perspective

574
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
and one thing that i did get back from

575
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,720
the results from all this is there's an

576
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,880
issue that is not

577
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,640
unique to the united states it's unique

578
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,440
to

579
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,280
the world when it comes to the

580
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,480
technology side of the house

581
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,799
so

582
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,799
ah well i'll get to that part that comes

583
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,039
in different parts of results legal

584
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,720
cases after i got finished setting my

585
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,840
questionnaire out then i went and

586
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,679
reviewed some case law

587
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,120
on the left hand side we have

588
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
jurisdiction

589
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,760
these cases in short discusses the

590
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
ability for a company or person we

591
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,240
phrase that discuss the bills the

592
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
ability for a entity wishing those

593
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
people to be brought under the purview

594
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,200
of a court so injury when it comes to

595
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,640
jurisdiction you have two different

596
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
types you have subject matter

597
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
jurisdiction and you have personal

598
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,799
jurisdiction

599
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,400
subject matter during prediction is the

600
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,880
course ability to actually hear the case

601
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,159
because of the topic that's being

602
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,440
discussed

603
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,280
personal jurisdiction is their ability

604
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,240
to enforce themselves upon you these

605
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,240
cases right here were cases that came

606
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,960
about that dealt with how to pull a

607
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,520
person into a court's jurisdiction

608
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
international shoe was one of the

609
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,720
landmark cases that dealt with out of

610
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,679
state

611
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
pulling one person in from well putting

612
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
a company in from a different state then

613
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,720
we have something called the zippo case

614
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,000
that came out of that which dealt with

615
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,600
many more contacts

616
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,200
y'all who dealt with bringing in

617
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
somebody that was foreign as well

618
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,440
so all these cases on the left deal with

619
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,440
how we can pull someone into someone's

620
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,640
jurisdiction

621
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,360
or if it's not even possible

622
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
and the last two aren't even the united

623
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,600
states by the way

624
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,679
internet surveillance did that one in

625
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,000
the middle so three-point approach

626
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,520
internet surveillance the that

627
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,840
particular case dealt with whether they

628
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,120
actually would appear to register

629
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,919
whether it is legal or not to record

630
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,000
communications as they happen

631
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,159
and at what point does a warrant need to

632
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,200
be done

633
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,320
before they can start pulling

634
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
communication in or recording what you

635
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:13,039
say

636
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,280
which leads to the third one chat room

637
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,400
and email

638
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,559
and in short those cases basically say

639
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,679
that you don't have a reasonable

640
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
expectation of privacy when phrase that

641
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,919
you have a limited to no expectation of

642
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,000
privacy when it comes to things you post

643
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,840
in the chat room

644
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,280
which is the reason why i brought that

645
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,200
up earlier that terrorists are now

646
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,600
recruiting using chat rooms

647
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,440
enter in the court cases says the

648
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,880
government has the ability to monitor

649
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,559
those they want and use them in a

650
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,559
hearing

651
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,720
so linear proposal and this came from

652
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
off of the responses i got back from the

653
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,480
surveys what can we do as it pertains as

654
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,200
it looks right now

655
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,600
three-prong approach three-axis approach

656
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,000
on one end we have the infrastructure

657
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
there one of the one of the results came

658
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,039
back saying that there is an extremely

659
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,520
outdated set of infrastructure and

660
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,280
actually the talk that comes after this

661
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
as well that talks about scatter ics and

662
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,440
um and

663
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,679
ot as well so i put a little bonus line

664
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:20,559
on the ends to give a little bit

665
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,320
brighten to give a segway for for his

666
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,080
speed to come in his talk

667
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,600
so that's one of the biggest issues that

668
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,640
came up there's outdated equipment uh

669
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,200
much of the systems that are used in in

670
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,919
scattering industrial control systems

671
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,240
uses modbus which is extremely

672
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,400
vulnerable protocol so we have a lot of

673
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
equipment out here that's really really

674
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,279
old that is still being used because it

675
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,559
works

676
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
and really really old stuff tends to

677
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,039
have really really big vulnerabilities

678
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,120
obviously so that was the first thing it

679
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,480
came back with

680
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
also there's an issue when it comes to

681
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,320
talent there's an issue when it comes to

682
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,799
finding individuals who have the

683
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,039
knowledge to deal with the problems and

684
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,880
actually secure stuff that's why i love

685
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,880
security conferences it's a bunch of

686
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,480
hungry minds that are here trying to

687
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,960
learn new stuff and expo and expand

688
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
their inspiring horizons

689
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
next up came the legal legislative

690
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,039
community

691
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,039
one of the biggest things that uh that i

692
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,360
got back from literally every single

693
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,760
response i got back was there was a

694
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,720
complete lack of cooperation between the

695
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,840
energy sectors and legislative bodies

696
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,000
complete lack of cooperation between the

697
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,919
two it's more on lines of here's what

698
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,440
you want go do

699
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,200
versus let's sit down on the table and

700
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,799
do this together

701
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,120
uh which means obviously that there

702
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,520
needs to be more cooperation

703
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,440
next big issue came in

704
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
there is a

705
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
gap between

706
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,559
the understanding of how cyber security

707
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,720
actually works and the legal is the bill

708
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,480
the legal community's ability to enforce

709
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,559
a law that actually could work

710
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,559
so we know how things work in the cyber

711
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,000
world

712
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,279
and then you have the legal side of the

713
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,679
house that says well we want this done

714
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,760
you like but that's just not going to

715
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,799
work

716
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
but we said do it

717
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,080
you don't have a choice but to do it and

718
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,679
find some way to make it work

719
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,080
which leaves problems so why not when i

720
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,000
start that from the from the understand

721
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,600
which there are people like me who

722
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
understands both the legal side and the

723
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,840
security side to say look

724
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
how about at least have one of us at the

725
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,679
table when you're meeting so we can

726
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,360
translate between the two parties and

727
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,400
try to come to a common ground

728
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,000
last but not least we have the

729
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,480
international part internationally it

730
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,279
has to be coordination between everybody

731
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,279
across the across the board to deal with

732
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,080
this

733
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,320
there's i think it's impossible for one

734
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,880
country in history has sown obviously

735
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,480
it's impossible for one country to

736
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
tackle this by themselves

737
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,039
so it needs to be more about just your

738
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,600
citizens but citizens in general people

739
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,639
in general to deal with the problem

740
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,120
which brings on future research so

741
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
i actually have to close this study out

742
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,840
because the irb told me i had to after

743
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
actually close the study out in about a

744
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,159
week and a half two weeks roughly so

745
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,240
once i finish the study in well this

746
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
phase of the study i plan on taking it

747
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
on to the next stop

748
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,600
next stop is going to look at the

749
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,400
infrastructure itself dig more into

750
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,480
what is going on and how can we improve

751
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,000
the infrastructure itself versus the the

752
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,919
overarching part so this would basically

753
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,919
be the precursor to digging deeper in

754
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,159
the weeds down the road so the city's

755
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,600
not going to end here obviously i'm

756
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
going to continue going let's see if we

757
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,640
can figure out what kind of training

758
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,400
gaps exist

759
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,400
i know uh

760
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,320
maybe two or three

761
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,480
schools that have classes specifically

762
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,400
gears towards dealing with industrial

763
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,799
control system security only about two

764
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,240
or three schools actually have those

765
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,600
that i've researched anyway i'm sure

766
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,200
there's more out there they actually

767
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,960
have classes specifically towards that

768
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,960
so we can learn how ot works itself

769
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
and do more research into our

770
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,400
international organizations

771
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,919
from the legal side of the house i'm

772
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,080
going to see if i can figure out if what

773
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,480
nexus is exists and next is basic

774
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,880
connection what nexus is exists between

775
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,320
the different countries see we can find

776
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,960
a way to use basically take advantage of

777
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,039
what's already there if there's already

778
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,520
some type of cooperative agreement if a

779
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,640
likes b

780
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,880
and c likes b why can't a and c meet

781
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,200
together and have a conversation see we

782
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
can find a way to admit that and yes

783
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,480
that's pythagorean's theorem if anybody

784
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,960
remember that

785
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,840
so that is what's up next for me

786
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
now i put a little bonus on there

787
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,000
that's how i would bring this up towards

788
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,559
the end we'll talk about some of the

789
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,799
technology stuff so you understand a bit

790
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,320
of the problem

791
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,159
so everybody in here understands the way

792
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,480
modern computer systems work we have

793
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,159
operating system we have all this stuff

794
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,960
installed on it but imagine

795
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,399
okay so

796
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,279
who in here likes classic cars

797
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:00,840
you like classic cars what's your

798
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,000
favorite uh

799
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,360
okay

800
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,640
okay so imagine taking the camaro 69

801
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
outfitting it with a gps system and

802
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,440
somehow changing the ignition from using

803
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,679
the camaro 69 use a distributed cap

804
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,279
moving the distributor cap and having

805
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,480
completely wired into a computer

806
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
that's the equivalency of what's been

807
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,840
going on with the energy sector

808
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,520
right

809
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,760
you still have you still have those same

810
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,600
you said have the same park plug same

811
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,840
spark wires you still have the same

812
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,399
basic mechanical system that's in place

813
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,320
that's being outfitted to work with the

814
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
computer which obviously means you can

815
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,039
have some problems if i want to if i

816
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,440
want to trip up your camaro there's two

817
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,720
ways i can do it from the computer side

818
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
of the house obviously or i can exploit

819
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,240
something that's tied to the actual

820
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,679
mechanics itself

821
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,320
such as the old banana tailpipe

822
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,600
that'll stop the car from running mess

823
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
up your missions

824
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,159
like cars too so

825
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,320
so scatter systems ics and dcs

826
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,880
scatter supervisory control and data

827
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,720
acquisition systems

828
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,440
this is your software and your hardware

829
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,200
and then you have like your pocs for

830
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,120
example programming logical

831
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
components as well

832
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,159
then you have your industrial control

833
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,679
system there's a picture that's coming

834
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,360
up next it kind of gives you overarching

835
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
how the stuff pulls together

836
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,039
and then you have your dc actually

837
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,679
distributed control systems which are

838
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,760
basically take that and then branch out

839
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,039
a tab at more than just that one

840
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,600
location because of geographical

841
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,880
dispersion

842
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
so within issues well i see yourself on

843
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,039
top of both of these but within your

844
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,039
scatter system and your dcs systems and

845
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,600
ics as a whole you have a lot of really

846
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,600
old components really old switches

847
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,960
really old

848
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,600
temperature gazes and sensors all that

849
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,080
stuff can be exploited

850
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,559
i i wish i would have had enough time

851
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,919
obviously i could have gone there's a

852
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,760
demonstration i have if you ever have

853
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,039
opportunity get something called scatter

854
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,279
br it's a virtual machine you can

855
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,600
download that simulates and scatter an

856
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,080
entire control system and you can use

857
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,240
that system to exploit it for those who

858
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,640
like to hack and find out ways to

859
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,039
trigger alarms scatter br is pretty cool

860
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,559
this is how it sits from an overarching

861
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,840
picture so ot ics and then of course

862
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,559
scattering dcs sits inside of those so

863
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,880
so your understanding of the topic

864
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,559
that's coming up next as well in the

865
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:29,840
issue itself

866
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,799
so if you're looking at it from a

867
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,000
this little thing so if you're looking

868
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,600
at it most of the problems we'll say

869
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,360
sits inside of here

870
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,360
but if this is compromised and obviously

871
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,559
the rest of it's going to be an issue

872
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,879
also

873
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,000
and in summary got trippy next in

874
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,120
summary

875
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,640
we need to do a better job at

876
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,279
collaborating between the energy sectors

877
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:56,960
uh which obviously where the cyber

878
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,519
security experts lie the cyber says well

879
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,200
rewind first we have to have more people

880
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,480
in cyber security to go and work for the

881
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,519
injury companies there is a there is an

882
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,440
extreme you can ask anybody who works in

883
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,519
an energy company who's in hiring there

884
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,840
is a big knowledge gap there there's

885
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,279
they have a lot of difficulty in finding

886
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,440
individuals that can do this stuff

887
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,399
so

888
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,320
may not be the most rewarding financial

889
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,600
standpoint but think about the bigger

890
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,480
picture also i did it for three years so

891
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,159
think about the bigger picture

892
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:25,840
from there you need to have a bigger

893
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,840
collaboration between the cyber security

894
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
world and the legal world again when i

895
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,960
was at the power company for two of my

896
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,760
three years we would review legislation

897
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,519
so in

898
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,600
the state of alabama was one of the last

899
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
states to actually pass a data breach

900
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,320
law they were on the very last ones and

901
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,519
what they were doing i was part of that

902
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,840
process they would draft up the law

903
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,279
whoever sentenced where it is or drop up

904
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,480
a law and they would send it to

905
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,559
different people within or within um

906
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:53,679
companies

907
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,600
they would then have a team within that

908
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
particular company so it was

909
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,240
four of us within the company we would

910
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,720
get the law review the law and then give

911
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,399
our feedback on it

912
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
out of those four people

913
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,919
i was only one that actually had a legal

914
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,840
background they were also sending law

915
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,880
not just to us but they're also

916
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,519
sentenced to link to um to uh law firms

917
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,799
and stuff like that as well to get their

918
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,279
opinion on it they would take that

919
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,120
look at all the comments and then

920
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,519
publish a final draft i can promise you

921
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,840
when i say this i've read not more than

922
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,600
just that one i've actually reviewed

923
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,760
that one i reviewed three presidential

924
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,640
elections pre-threat tongue twists three

925
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,320
presidential uh

926
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,399
directors as well

927
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,960
and a few other things so

928
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,120
the bulk of the feedback that happens

929
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,679
doesn't get put into these laws maybe

930
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,919
one percent i can i know from a fact

931
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,039
from looking at these things in the

932
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,799
final version that there were things

933
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,360
that were just completely ignored so

934
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,720
there has to be a bit of collaboration

935
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,799
with that you're giving the law these

936
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,880
laws are imposing us you kind of gotta

937
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,720
take our opinion on this stuff

938
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,000
we know if we can actually do it or not

939
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,519
and as promised

940
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,480
well the troopy page that's my mommy

941
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,360
so

942
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
on

943
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,200
exactly today five years ago

944
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,120
we had my mother's funeral so it's a

945
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,440
real moment five years ago to this date

946
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,960
was my mommy's funeral

947
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
she was how i got started in i.t back in

948
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
the 1990s it was all her fault

949
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,120
so

950
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,480
she was one of the first women in

951
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,720
computers uh she started doing computer

952
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,399
classes and teaching people how to type

953
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,159
if you're anybody remembers mavis beacon

954
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,760
from a very long time ago she taught

955
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,840
people maybe speaking how to type and

956
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,600
she went from teaching people how to

957
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,600
type to building computers teaching

958
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,760
folks how to program the whole nine

959
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,360
yards network and everything else she

960
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,039
became a microsoft partner and all this

961
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,159
fun stuff she did a lot within probably

962
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,480
a five six year period

963
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,799
until i went to college and

964
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,320
i think the first weekend i was there

965
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,799
she had a stroke and that slowly but

966
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,159
surely started shutting her business

967
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,000
down um and after that her business kind

968
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,360
of folded because

969
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,200
of the person she left and charged for

970
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,279
her company literally distorted the

971
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,960
company for money

972
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,159
so

973
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,880
because of that uh because my mom was a

974
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,280
wonderful story the school that i work

975
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,800
at it started this whole scholarship for

976
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
my mommy so now my mommy has their own

977
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,480
scholarship so

978
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,000
surreal moment they told me i had the

979
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,679
ability on the day of her funeral to

980
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,199
actually share the news my mommy has her

981
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,639
own scholarship so that we can so that

982
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,800
uh individuals who want to go to school

983
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,960
and learn cybersecurity learn this field

984
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,399
can get money to help them pay for

985
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,918
school

986
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,918
so it doesn't benefit me anymore still

987
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:34,879
thank you thank you

988
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:35,520
answered

989
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
[Applause]

990
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,520
questions

991
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,359
had to stop myself from crying up here

992
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,359
how to find in yes

993
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,320
15 million dollars all right

994
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,159
is that a lot

995
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,000
15 million uh

996
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
from a fine standpoint yes

997
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,640
so

998
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,760
from a fine standpoint yes so the way

999
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
most of the companies work is you have

1000
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
your base salary and then you have your

1001
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,760
bonuses that you get your bonuses are

1002
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
tied towards how much money they make

1003
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,520
from selling of energy

1004
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,280
the overall management of the company

1005
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,599
and things such as fines so a 15 million

1006
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,040
dollar fine means that you wouldn't meet

1007
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,880
your performance percentage so your

1008
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
bonuses start getting affected

1009
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,240
so

1010
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
some of the bonuses to give an idea of

1011
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,680
how that how much of an impact it boils

1012
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
down to once you hear say the management

1013
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,200
level and start getting into the

1014
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,880
executive side of the house some bonuses

1015
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,920
with large enough people going and

1016
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,160
bought houses with their bonus checks

1017
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,440
for the year

1018
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,520
so yeah 15 million is a significant

1019
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,280
amount a significant amount of money

1020
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,760
from that perspective

1021
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,240
oh it's nothing compared gpr

1022
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,440
i think oh my god i think gdpr's largest

1023
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,680
one is like 150 million i think right

1024
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,400
now

1025
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,920
so yeah there's nothing compared to that

1026
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,400
that's 10 percent

1027
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
do you think if the potential

1028
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
complaints

1029
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
were tied to

1030
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,480
revenue percentage i think that would

1031
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,920
help drive

1032
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,839
further security improvements in the

1033
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:10,720
sector

1034
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,880
no i think that if they really want to

1035
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,640
drive force the home as opposed to tying

1036
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,160
into revenue percentages then you will

1037
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
have another issue to deal with you have

1038
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,440
the public service commission which is

1039
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,280
psc which governs how much the power

1040
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,960
company can charge for power on the

1041
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,680
united states so you run you run the

1042
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,760
risk of them having of them having that

1043
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,960
cap so the money has to come from

1044
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
somewhere but if they really want to

1045
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,560
enforce it and push it get those one

1046
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,720
million dollar fines per day

1047
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,000
that's a quick way to get there without

1048
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,480
tying towards revenue

1049
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,200
no

1050
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,520
that's an easy way to do it

1051
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,280
you know the questions

1052
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,680
yes sir

1053
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,920
hello hi hello

1054
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,359
so um

1055
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,480
nice talk

1056
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
and i appreciate it and like the

1057
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,359
intersection of the topics so um my

1058
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,640
question is

1059
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,280
uh how do you see like computer people

1060
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,320
science learning laws or law people

1061
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,160
learning computer science

1062
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,119
oh

1063
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,680
because you are one guy in the

1064
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,320
but i've been in in that burden

1065
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,920
understanding law enforcement people

1066
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,400
talking about how do we do this

1067
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,040
then you know the the the court says you

1068
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,359
cannot do this because the law says that

1069
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,280
and then the technician says hey but we

1070
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,359
cannot do anything of this we need to do

1071
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,920
it the other way around right so i mean

1072
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,160
how would you deal and and where do

1073
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,240
would you put the money on the knowledge

1074
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,960
you know i would go with the computer

1075
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,960
people learning the law the path that i

1076
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
went um the skills that you learn

1077
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,000
learning learning information technology

1078
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,079
bring gives you the analytical ability

1079
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,160
that's necessary to get to law school a

1080
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,520
lot easier

1081
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,599
as opposed to learning that and having

1082
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,200
that approach of things and then trying

1083
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
to look at the constraints that that

1084
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
cyberworld gives you i think it's easier

1085
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,880
to go from computers to law than other

1086
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,200
way around

1087
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,400
yeah i mean

1088
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,320
the bad news is that we have a lot of

1089
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,640
people that they don't have this kind of

1090
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,720
preparation and yeah they are they are

1091
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,400
enforcing the power you know and it's

1092
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,560
very difficult to deal with those but

1093
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,800
yeah so what triggered me getting

1094
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,079
actually the military is the reason why

1095
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,400
i got in law school coincidentally but

1096
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,640
all because of the military but uh also

1097
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,800
i had an instructor who told me i said

1098
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,400
i'm kind of thinking about getting into

1099
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
the legal world and you say well if you

1100
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,720
do it you'll be one of very few people

1101
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,359
that do both so i said he said it would

1102
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,200
probably be easier for you even he said

1103
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,079
himself um his name was dr julio rivera

1104
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,000
he was my own professors at uab here

1105
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,160
she's retiring now but he even him said

1106
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:37,839
he said it would be easier to move from

1107
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:40,160
that field over because of

1108
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
the the the analytical stuff that we

1109
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,480
deal with in technology

1110
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,240
i have not met a single person that went

1111
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,839
from law backwards

1112
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,000
so

1113
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,720
that's a good point

1114
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,919
any more questions

1115
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,839
yes ma'am

1116
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,160
thank you

1117
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,119
it is a very interesting how you are

1118
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,599
studying the gaps of illegal frameworks

1119
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,119
so i was just wondering how do you use a

1120
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,400
data

1121
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,280
how do you analyze data to get into this

1122
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,680
to get these results so about the

1123
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,240
statistical significance of the of the

1124
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,160
answers and this

1125
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,599
ah the research methodology so okay so

1126
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,359
it's a it's actually a multiple case

1127
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,359
study that i did in long run with the

1128
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,240
questionnaire as well so i pull

1129
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,960
a lot of cases so i have if i remember

1130
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,800
correctly around 50 something legal

1131
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,720
cases that i pull actually i think not

1132
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,920
the book's not my book back but i

1133
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,560
actually went and went and found

1134
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,000
four different case books that cover

1135
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,560
cyber law terrorism international law

1136
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,880
and computer crime use those four case

1137
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,560
books to pull cases out of that would

1138
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,079
give me the information that could be

1139
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,400
transferable across that gave my legal

1140
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,240
cases from there i went into the

1141
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
questionnaire and started and it was a

1142
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,480
total of 15 questions if anybody fits

1143
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,160
the requirements please i have one more

1144
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,920
week to actually do cuts questionnaires

1145
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,800
but

1146
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,280
it says 15 questions total and once i

1147
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,880
got the answers back to those i look for

1148
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,800
common trends between how every question

1149
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,040
was answered and used that to create my

1150
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,200
statistical analysis on it by seeing

1151
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
that what actually was what would kept

1152
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,079
repeating over and over again

1153
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:25,599
when i tell you one for example one

1154
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,040
person gave me a response back that was

1155
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,520
around three pages long to answer 15

1156
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
questions

1157
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,359
so

1158
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,960
a lot of digging

1159
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,400
a lot of digging

1160
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,839
and then once you get that data then you

1161
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,760
cross it back over with the law cases

1162
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,359
look for familiarities to get the final

1163
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,359
product

1164
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:44,240
thank you no problem

1165
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,160
any more questions ah yes

1166
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
one more question so

1167
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,079
you said at the beginning that it's a

1168
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,960
pretty u.s centric and uk centric still

1169
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,440
looking at the global scale so do you

1170
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
think it's plausible that with all the

1171
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,520
tension we have globally like uh the us

1172
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,720
vs eu

1173
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,720
with the gdpr

1174
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,200
stuff uh do you think it's plausible

1175
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,319
that for

1176
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,240
cyber crime we can

1177
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,720
find some kind of global legal solution

1178
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,680
i think it is um if we can all say that

1179
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,680
genocide is bad and everybody across the

1180
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,319
world votes a genocide as bad then we

1181
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,079
can probably do the same there's always

1182
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,839
hope if there wasn't any hope then we're

1183
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,200
basically saying we're doomed to deal

1184
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,640
with this forever and forever until

1185
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,720
humanity exists it exists

1186
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,319
well there's an ongoing experiment about

1187
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,319
that right now yes

1188
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,880
yes true very true very true

1189
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,000
it's interesting actually it's happening

1190
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,200
right now when i'm doing this research

1191
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
topic right

1192
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,759
more questions

1193
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,100
well thank you very much for your time

1194
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:49,949
