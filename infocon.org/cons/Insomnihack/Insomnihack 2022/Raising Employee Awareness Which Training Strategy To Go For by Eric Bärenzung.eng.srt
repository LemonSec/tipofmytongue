2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,040
it's fine so good afternoon everyone so

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,520
my name is eric banzong as mentioned i'm

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,680
doing some consulting here in fact in

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,520
switzerland for private bank

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,400
i used to work in china and so on i mean

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,920
if you look on my profile on linkedin

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,840
you will know everything about me

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,279
no social engineering there so

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,760
i will not go into my life so today the

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,160
topic of my

12
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,719
talk is regarding cyber security

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,920
training and how to raise awareness

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,879
so

15
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,520
to summarize very simple why we have to

16
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,480
do that how you should do that okay and

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,640
on which topic what so what are the

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,760
subject you should address

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,600
so

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,719
let's go

21
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,559
into the y

22
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,559
sorry

23
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,800
so there are many reasons okay from the

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
image you can guess some of them

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
first i mean every day is bringing a lot

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,920
of news okay i mean

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,680
le

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,400
suisse recently octa bridge also which

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,720
can affect many companies

30
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,000
so the goal is not to go into the

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,240
details but as you i mean you are more

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,479
most of you familiar with all this so no

33
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,520
point

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,240
so why doing training on for people

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,759
because you have human is usually known

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,960
as a

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,360
weakest link but i i don't like this

38
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,240
this

39
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
this term so i will explain why

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
so if you look at some report typically

41
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:38,720
the

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,119
verizon database investigation report

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,200
that says that 85

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,399
of the

45
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,320
data which are used i mean are caused by

46
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,280
human error okay voluntary involuntary

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,360
of course most of the attack at one

48
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,360
point or the other they need to click on

49
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
something to install to go on the

50
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
fishing link and so on so human is

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,040
definitely a nice target

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,719
so why we should do

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,759
race security awareness to protect okay

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
it can be protected your family your

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,080
colleagues your company your passions

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
the citizens so depending where in which

57
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,560
organization you are working you are at

58
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,520
one point to protect someone

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,840
and something business too

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,239
okay the goal of the training is really

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
to make in fact the human

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,440
your best in the company okay the the

63
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
strongest control okay

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,640
people say it's the weakest thing

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,080
because a lot of error are coming from

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,239
human but it's not because people are

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,640
weak okay just because it's easy it is

68
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
an easy target for cyber criminals it's

69
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
much easier to send 1000 emails to

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,400
someone they're just trying to get into

71
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
firewall and things like this

72
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,319
so the target is really to make the

73
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,560
people the strongest control as you know

74
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
i mean most probably some of you are

75
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,800
working in circus and so on at one point

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,560
or the other you may have a mail with

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
your phishing link or the document

78
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,120
corrupted which may go through all the

79
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
the

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
the firewalls

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,760
so how should you train people i mean

82
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
how should you raise awareness okay

83
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,720
first the first thing you should do when

84
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,640
you do the training explain why you are

85
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,480
doing this training okay you have to

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
explain why your company is at risk why

87
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,200
we count on the people to do this

88
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,280
security okay and the why is very

89
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,040
important because i mean it's not

90
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,480
psychology it's biology okay so if

91
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,799
the y is at the center of the brain it

92
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,080
gives the people why they should do it

93
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,440
and why

94
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,280
they should um how can i say that

95
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
believe in what you are saying okay you

96
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,440
can give lots of number and so on but at

97
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
the end if you don't explain why people

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
will forget and they will not continue

99
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
to help you on the on the subject

100
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,239
another aspect is of course getting the

101
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,519
board on board

102
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,799
so

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,239
you need the support from the top

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,310
management okay

105
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:03,840
[Music]

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,680
and don't go to the board saying okay i

107
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
have an issue i mean can you help me and

108
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,599
so on you have to go to the

109
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,319
solution okay and explain them exactly

110
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,799
what you need from them okay i mean if

111
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,160
some people are familiar with the

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,639
management concept of feeding other

113
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,639
monkeys that's typically the goal the

114
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,160
goal is not to bring your monkey to the

115
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,639
board but more to get them helping you

116
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,639
out to solve the issue

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,199
i'm making it quick okay sorry but if

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,880
you want to ask questions after it say

119
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,000
i'm actually spoiled

120
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
so in terms of content

121
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,560
multiple formats okay

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,440
so

123
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
i give you some posters okay so you see

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,400
different around the poster around the

125
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,560
world as you can see

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,320
you really have to adapt the culture for

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,000
example i take the french one also

128
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
on the left

129
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,680
and i talked to some colleagues in japan

130
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
and they said this we can never do in

131
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,919
japan it will occur so this is valid for

132
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,160
country but this is also ready for the

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,320
company culture okay you don't you don't

134
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,720
do the same training in the private bank

135
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,479
then on the startup or the med tech

136
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,120
company so you are ready to adapt to the

137
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,039
to your assistant to the audience

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,759
some some company okay i will come back

139
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,840
on the budget later on but people are

140
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,280
publishing newsletter yeah and some even

141
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,120
publishing booklets

142
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,520
to to popularize the subject

143
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,199
if you really want to keep the audience

144
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,840
involved you can organize events for

145
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,960
example at iwc so the watch company they

146
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,360
are doing that on a regular basis that

147
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,960
organizes this

148
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,840
lunch and learn

149
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,400
topic some companies are also using some

150
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
special months like for example in

151
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,759
europe you have the european cyber

152
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,919
security months in october so people are

153
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,360
doing a lot of events during these

154
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,520
months

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,680
in singapore it will be in may

156
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,160
as you have seen on the booth a lot of

157
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,919
goodies okay

158
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:12,639
so

159
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,720
by the way some people want some mug i

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,870
have some of them

161
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,000
[Music]

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,120
and so they are delivering mouse pad and

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
so on okay so ready to make the thing

164
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
people think all day long regarding

165
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,159
security

166
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,919
regarding slides this is the most common

167
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,000
as uh as of today

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,039
so there is a 10 20 uh 30 rules okay i

169
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,080
will not go into the details but

170
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,360
10 slides 20 minutes and big fonts okay

171
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,120
i mean as you can see i'm not putting a

172
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,520
lot of text in my slide but i usually

173
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
don't like when people are putting all

174
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,800
the lecture on the thing

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
in term of video

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,759
the let's say optimum

177
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,080
timing is around 3-6 minutes

178
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,160
they make a survey and so that's what

179
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,759
came out okay so i give you some

180
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,479
examples again in terms of culture

181
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
so this one is done by the french so i

182
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,639
don't know if we can hear the sound but

183
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
let me check

184
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,420
[Music]

185
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,560
it doesn't work it doesn't matter anyway

186
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,639
so just to give you an idea a little bit

187
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,160
of your bore this is done by the

188
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,840
ministry in france so this is not a joke

189
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,919
and if you go into japan oops sorry

190
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,919
you will see different things okay so

191
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,240
the culture always important

192
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,599
so gamification this is a trail so you

193
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,720
will see

194
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,840
the ansi so the

195
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,919
national ascension the situation format

196
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,560
in france i just really published the

197
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,720
kits for the schools in fact they just

198
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,080
make a conferences today okay

199
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,639
so in terms of gamification there are

200
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
two aspects one is the content how you

201
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
create your content and then the great

202
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
idea is to also engage internal

203
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,919
competition the good thing about

204
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,599
competition is that even if you don't

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,960
give score

206
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
and if your your campaign is well done

207
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,160
the people will always try to evolve

208
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,560
in in the better way okay as far as they

209
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,799
are not the top one they will continue

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,880
to improving for improvement

211
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,799
and i will give you an example after

212
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,958
so why

213
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,679
again okay this morning the first in the

214
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,839
first conference it was the army but if

215
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,839
you remember at one point it was

216
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,920
mentioned learn while playing so this is

217
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,839
the case so

218
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,200
it increased

219
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,440
the votivation and the engagement of the

220
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
audience this is very important and also

221
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
now with the with let's say use of

222
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,320
machine learning

223
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,720
you can also adapt your game to the

224
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,399
audience level okay if you get a

225
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,320
beginner in cyber security you can ask

226
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,399
some questions and if it's someone who

227
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,200
already expert you can adapt the content

228
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,880
to the person sorry

229
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,980
[Music]

230
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,399
so this is an example that is accounts

231
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,440
so

232
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
first this is voluntary okay they are

233
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,920
not asking everyone to participate they

234
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,000
start involuntary they do they do that

235
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,040
twice

236
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
three times a year

237
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,320
but the more they do it the more people

238
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,640
are willing to participate

239
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,399
and the great thing about this is just

240
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,399
not only learning where people have to

241
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,240
click and so on there is a really a

242
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
marketing campaign within the company

243
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,680
with uh

244
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,680
with a lot of poster and goodies

245
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,399
distributed within the company so this

246
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,760
is not only please click on the

247
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,160
relearning thing and try to do the trade

248
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,120
again so this is uh and it's working

249
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,680
and people are really asking for it

250
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,600
and i just read before an example also

251
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,240
with the itv company in the media in the

252
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,519
uk

253
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
they did organize an escape room on

254
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,360
cyber security and

255
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,200
visit the company it really became

256
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
something very famous and people are

257
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,279
asking when we get the next xk crew

258
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,240
escape and so on so gaming is really the

259
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,600
other trend and something you should

260
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
investigate

261
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,920
so this is an example for example what

262
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,000
is done by uc startup collector i have

263
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,320
no action whatever okay so just to give

264
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,279
you an id so you are very basic cartoon

265
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,600
at the level question one question for

266
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,160
question three but if you look how the

267
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
programming is done you see that there

268
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,360
is a lot of direction because of course

269
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,120
the profile of the audience depending

270
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,720
how the people will answer the first

271
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
questions that will be redirected to

272
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,640
another one and so on and so on so you

273
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,800
can build very complex

274
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,120
scenarios which adapt to the audience of

275
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
the world company and the different

276
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,279
level of

277
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,439
of knowledge

278
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,959
what you should do also is to measure

279
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,000
okay

280
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
you need to get

281
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,399
kpi key performance indicator

282
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,040
and why you need that first usually

283
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
because you need to justify your budget

284
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,880
okay your manager will probably ask what

285
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,399
did you do with your money with my money

286
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,279
uh and then of course track the

287
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,360
evolution okay the goal is really to

288
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,279
improve the situation of your company in

289
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
terms of cyber security awareness

290
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,600
and also to evaluate your overall

291
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,240
company maturity level i put here i i i

292
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,079
think science has a proof on the

293
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:39,760
exhibition so there is a source

294
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,079
naturally maturity level which allows

295
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,320
you to see where you stand and where you

296
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,920
should go

297
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,600
so if you need some information on that

298
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,800
you can say

299
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,959
contacts also you can contact me after

300
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
how you do that so nothing special here

301
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,560
huh quiz at the most famous one

302
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,240
there is more and more notification

303
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,639
button i mean microsoft is proposing uh

304
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,600
one in outlook to mention

305
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,760
phishing link and so on of course you

306
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,920
have the outline for some companies

307
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,680
people are calling you to solve some

308
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,399
cyber security issues or asking

309
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,440
questions

310
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,839
and when you do training you can also

311
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,480
ask for satisfaction surveys it's always

312
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,800
interesting including for the trainer to

313
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
see this representation whether good or

314
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,720
not what should be improved next time

315
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
and so on

316
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,480
and also i forget this one getting off

317
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,320
enough data okay if it is doing

318
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,680
something

319
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,200
uh

320
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,160
if you get if you need statistics

321
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,760
for example if you do one fishing

322
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,000
campaign per year

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,680
it's not enough okay you should do at

324
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,920
least six i mean usually people say

325
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
eight fish in campaign period you don't

326
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,200
have to do once every two weeks because

327
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,920
otherwise people believe varied

328
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,480
and uh it will not be easy for them at

329
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,839
the end they will not participate

330
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,839
anymore

331
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,760
so on what uh on which uh elements

332
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,079
should get measured

333
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:12,959
uh

334
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,200
first how many people i mean how many

335
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
incidents are reporting fishing emails

336
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,040
and so on

337
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,480
also

338
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,639
yeah you should ask positive things okay

339
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,480
reporting

340
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,079
question asked to the secretary team i

341
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,320
mean sometime i do a training and people

342
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,720
call me after to say okay i didn't

343
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
understand that or okay or later on even

344
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
one month later they say eric i have

345
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,440
this fit and you help me and so on and

346
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,120
of course trinidad's satisfaction survey

347
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,839
and i put in smaller cases the fishing

348
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,839
lane okay of course that's the easiest

349
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,920
thing or when you do a fishing campaign

350
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,000
you can measure how many people get

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
click on the link but it really depends

352
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,639
on the efficiency on the campaign and

353
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,440
then i would say this brings a negative

354
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,240
aspect to the training okay so i mean of

355
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,480
course you can measure it but

356
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,320
depending the quality of the campaign

357
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,560
you can go you can get crazy numbers so

358
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,040
it might give a wrong wrong picture and

359
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,360
also people might be afraid to click to

360
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,320
report it later

361
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:16,959
on um

362
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,120
in terms of don't think there is not to

363
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,760
do don't blame okay if people click on

364
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,839
the officially during the campaign don't

365
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,920
say hey you click start good and so on

366
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,959
okay maybe

367
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,519
after 10 campaign if

368
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,839
if the person does not understand maybe

369
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,839
but at the beginning don't do that okay

370
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
it's much better to reward the people

371
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,839
say okay here is the best department the

372
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,000
best person and so on i give a picture

373
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,279
of the radar i don't know if you know

374
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,760
this one this is in stockholm so instead

375
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
of this is a speed rather but instead of

376
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,120
saying okay you are running too fast

377
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,000
okay if you if you are under the limit

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,160
you are participating to a low trade

379
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,120
okay and people are now the speed limit

380
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
and the speed measures are going down

381
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,880
and down because more and more people

382
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,279
are taking attention to to be able to

383
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,960
participate to 03.

384
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,149
[Music]

385
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,199
so depending your company

386
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
yeah you might need help okay so you

387
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,680
might be there

388
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
because you are not enough people okay

389
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
or you or your team is already booked

390
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
150 on something else and also in terms

391
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,760
of budget might be limited

392
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,800
so you can help you can get help deliver

393
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,600
training okay face-to-face maybe

394
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,079
face-to-face training and so on but also

395
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,320
to create content okay as there are many

396
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,399
companies around the world providing

397
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
content on a regular basis because

398
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,360
training as security is an ongoing

399
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,440
process okay so you need to refresh your

400
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,160
content on the way on on a regular basis

401
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
if you do a one training when you go

402
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,240
into the company and for and there is no

403
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,079
more training till the end of your life

404
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,839
there's no point okay so you are ready

405
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,560
to refresh refresh refresh

406
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,480
and companies a lot of companies are

407
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,199
providing such content

408
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,639
training on what so without

409
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,079
okay we just mentioned social

410
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,399
engineering before okay so we'll not go

411
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,279
i will not challenge talk of my previous

412
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,519
teacher speaker

413
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,519
fishing is a classic one

414
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,959
i would say it's normal typically in the

415
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,639
financial industry it's a it's a venture

416
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,279
you saved me

417
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,360
no

418
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,680
yeah uh fishing for 80 percent of the

419
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,160
financial financial industries this is a

420
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
major threat

421
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,120
password policy okay

422
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,800
you have good practice i mean people

423
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,040
sometimes are trying to make it great so

424
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,399
you know they want to send the files

425
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,639
encrypted and so on with the password

426
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,519
like

427
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,279
the number is one two three four eight

428
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
okay so there's no point including a

429
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,839
platform like this

430
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,119
removable media okay i know it's not

431
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,880
not too much a trend anymore i mean if

432
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,160
you look on the booth there are not so

433
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,599
much usb stick okay it choose to be but

434
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,199
i put it back because at the beginning

435
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,640
of the year

436
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,319
some people in the state receive back

437
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,799
usb stick in a by mail in fact at home

438
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,520
and

439
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,119
okay you receive that by mail with an

440
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,839
amazon thing and so on and people try to

441
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,559
log on and to put the usb and the pc and

442
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,720
of course it has malware inside

443
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,120
so this is also important okay

444
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,600
even if it's not so common anymore but

445
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,600
you see it's not forgotten by the cyber

446
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,159
criminal

447
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,360
mobile security okay most of us are

448
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,679
looking at their email accessing their

449
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,640
bank and so on for a mobile application

450
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,360
so

451
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,000
up to i mean patchy okay i mean patching

452
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,039
a software upgrade nothing i mean

453
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,960
there's an audience here which we should

454
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
i should not even have to say that but

455
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,679
it's always good to point out and also

456
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,440
it depends the industry you are working

457
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,000
on on data link prevention okay you can

458
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,320
you don't want okay in the bank industry

459
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,160
your customer your customer or your

460
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,080
employees to go out but if you are in a

461
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,799
pharmaceutical you don't want any ip or

462
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,799
in the watch industry the same thing

463
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,679
intellectual property and so on so your

464
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,559
data is very important

465
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,579
[Music]

466
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,880
okay that was the classic

467
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,960
so then depending what uh what is your

468
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,039
activity you might be interested to have

469
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,520
closer training on a secure software

470
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
development

471
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,039
you can work on iot and embedded

472
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
security

473
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,080
some of us are starting to look at

474
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
quantum security

475
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,000
and of course the big topic is crisis

476
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
management okay so this is a real big

477
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,640
one for the pictures one from the it

478
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
will say they organized on a regular

479
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
basis cyber drill

480
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,720
this one was done in muldavia

481
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,360
and that's it

482
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,559
so i was fat okay so to summarize there

483
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,960
is no one-size-fits-all approach okay

484
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,840
you have to adapt to your audience

485
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
you really need to explain why you are

486
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,440
doing training

487
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,480
and practice practice and practice i

488
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,360
mean it's so basic so we have a lot of

489
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,840
time to talk if you want if you have

490
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
questions

491
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,000
whatever

492
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,240
thank you very much eric please give him

493
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,840
a big round of applause thank you

494
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,719
[Applause]

495
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,879
any questions for eric

496
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,760
hi thank you very much for the the

497
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,960
speech here

498
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,160
um so my question is um in the industry

499
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
where i work in i have 120 colleagues

500
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,840
that work with me

501
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,200
and of the 120 colleagues um

502
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,679
since i've taken over i've sent multiple

503
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:10,960
emails out

504
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,919
especially about phishing and spamming

505
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
and especially about like different

506
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,280
attacks and stuff

507
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,640
and

508
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,960
the point where i'm getting at is um

509
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,799
from what i've seen is that uh when i

510
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,039
send out these emails that try to warn

511
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,520
people and tell them uh hey be careful

512
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,520
for these attacks and stuff

513
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,280
i've come to find out that some of the

514
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,440
users will actually take the email and

515
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,520
just throw it away directly so they

516
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,360
don't even read the the information and

517
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,080
it's not very complicated information it

518
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,120
is simple

519
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,480
uh tabs of like four informations

520
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,679
uh

521
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,679
why is it happening how come is it

522
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:50,799
happening

523
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,960
and and what will it affect on our

524
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,000
network

525
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,559
and and like i said what for me the

526
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,159
question would be what could i do to

527
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,600
improve at that point if the message is

528
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,120
not getting to them

529
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,080
uh what else could i try to do

530
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,120
to to to try to warn these users hey you

531
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
need to pay attention to this because

532
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,080
this is critical

533
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,240
i would say you should first try instead

534
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,480
of sending emails just try to organize

535
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
small meetings and even the 15 minutes

536
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,520
or 20 minutes presentation

537
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:24,240
you have 180 people you do like for five

538
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,919
sessions on different days during the

539
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,120
different weeks and step by step you are

540
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,600
you engage your your audience and you

541
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,840
explain them i mean email i mean we are

542
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,000
receiving thousands of them every day

543
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,080
and it's difficult so unless till the

544
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,799
day your company will have a problem or

545
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,559
they will have a problem at home and so

546
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,320
they will they might not be fake they

547
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
might not be concerned so

548
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
yeah instead of sending email i would

549
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,720
say just try organizing very small

550
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
meeting i mean don't don't spend one

551
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,480
hour i mean i'm doing well training

552
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,400
sometimes on main topics but

553
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,640
if you want to address only fishing okay

554
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
just explain why give an example just

555
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,200
for example give a

556
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
fake i mean you can build it and doing

557
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,960
that you can build a fake email saying

558
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
okay take care attention of this thing

559
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,400
on this thing on this thing

560
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,799
and if you see that here if you if you

561
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,640
see that this is the fishing line then

562
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,039
you should do that so to better do that

563
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,480
in the i mean

564
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,080
and also maybe if you are working i

565
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,440
don't know which industry you're working

566
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
but maybe you can give some examples say

567
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,840
to say okay here is what happened to our

568
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,919
let's say colleagues or competitors and

569
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
so on and just to

570
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,320
yeah again so why okay why the company

571
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,840
is at risk why the why your audience

572
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,280
is a

573
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,919
should parties should take care to

574
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,919
take care of that because as i was

575
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,679
mentioning before one day or the other

576
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,080
one meg with a corrupted file might go

577
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,720
through all the system security system

578
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,840
so are you ready to uh to explain why

579
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,520
just don't quit meeting everything

580
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,679
instead of saying you know it's selling

581
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,919
uh 10 times the email just do 10 minutes

582
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,440
15 minutes

583
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,520
so without giving out too much

584
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
information with my company uh they were

585
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,480
actually hacked back in 2020

586
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,360
so the problem is that the users do know

587
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,760
that there is a huge vulnerability

588
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,960
and that's the problem what i'm having

589
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,720
to deal with now is that since i've

590
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,960
taken over in 2021

591
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,799
the problem is that the users

592
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,039
know that there was a hacking

593
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,400
but uh

594
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
seem to be reluctant on how they want to

595
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
deal with the the the future of how to

596
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,720
protect the company

597
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,600
so

598
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,559
yeah

599
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,240
yeah because maybe there were not enough

600
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,200
impacted themselves but yeah

601
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,360
that's why i mean they're still working

602
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,200
so it's something you know the company

603
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,279
didn't go bankrupt so maybe they say

604
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,640
okay fine and

605
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,000
and sometimes

606
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
so people are giving the impression that

607
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,240
in security the security department or

608
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,559
united department issue and it's not the

609
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,039
case it's everyone issues

610
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,559
so it's really uh

611
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,240
yeah we can have a talk after if we went

612
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
offline i will be pleased to see

613
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,360
you to discuss all right cool thank you

614
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,440
yeah okay i appreciate it thank you very

615
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
much you're welcome

616
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,159
you're getting the board on board is

617
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,120
important by getting employees too

618
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,200
that's the most important thing

619
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,440
you know i i wanted to put this picture

620
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,120
but i didn't have the time i take a

621
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,240
picture of a

622
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,559
very old castle okay you have all these

623
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,720
walls and some at that point point you

624
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,320
still have windows where people can

625
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,400
watch out and where people can

626
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,760
completely

627
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,799
fire on the enemy okay so you can put

628
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,679
20 meters high wall at the top there's

629
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,400
always one guy or several one to take

630
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
care of the security

631
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,120
are there more questions sir

632
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,400
hi thank you

633
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,159
um you mentioned

634
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,840
the possibility of

635
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,640
doing a training on dlp on data loss

636
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,440
preparation how do you go about setting

637
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,520
this up

638
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,320
so uh

639
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,200
i would say first is to uh i mean in

640
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,080
terms of

641
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,919
the italic prevention first you have to

642
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,640
uh

643
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,400
provide information regarding the data

644
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,720
classification okay how is it within

645
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,039
your company how is that classified and

646
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,360
how it should be protected okay

647
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,320
typically secret data encrypted linkedin

648
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,880
and so on okay so that's the first thing

649
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,440
i mean how is it classified

650
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,360
and then

651
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
if you have already a dlp tool within

652
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,120
your company you potentially can have

653
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,279
statistics on the department you are

654
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,679
teaching where to okay so you you might

655
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,600
say okay over the last year we observe

656
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
this is this okay so the type of alert

657
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,440
it was high so lows medium it was normal

658
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,000
it was critical so people were some were

659
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,760
reported and so on

660
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,960
and then

661
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,520
i would say of course best practice okay

662
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,600
so you should be okay instead of sending

663
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,760
email internally you should do this you

664
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,360
know for example you have a secure

665
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
folder or sharepoint there is a

666
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
restricted sharepoint okay instead of

667
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
sending emails with potentially secret

668
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,799
information which can be

669
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,640
i would not say thrown away but a

670
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
mistake you know sending to the wrong

671
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,039
destination and so on it's easy out so

672
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,760
giving best practice and also

673
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,559
this is uh i mean again sorry we can

674
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,880
discuss that after i'm here

675
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,120
later on but there are

676
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,960
so yeah

677
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,440
uh why what again what what do you have

678
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,159
to protect

679
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,200
what what has been observed okay and

680
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
yeah what should be done to

681
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,559
correct the wrong behaviors

682
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
okay and the advantage when you do that

683
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,880
on a regular basis is that on the you

684
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,799
can go back the next year the next six

685
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,159
months and say okay we see the

686
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,640
revolution and so okay sometimes i don't

687
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,559
know your company might say sorry i

688
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,240
don't have the solution okay people say

689
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,840
i would like to do that and this and

690
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,480
that say okay sorry for the timing we

691
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,039
don't have the solution so the best

692
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,440
solution would be to do this way but

693
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
even if it's not perfect but at least

694
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,919
people are aware

695
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,039
i see another question here

696
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,200
thank you for your presentation

697
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,520
um maybe you're familiar with the

698
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,080
turning sugar effect when the less

699
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,480
familiar you are with a subject the more

700
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,520
expert you feel

701
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,720
and

702
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,960
i've noticed that uh some people after

703
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,159
one workshop on cyber security feel like

704
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,399
they're really confident about the fact

705
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,039
about identifying a spam

706
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,000
and how would you prevent it are you

707
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,399
organizing fishing campaign already yeah

708
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,880
my company so my people make it a very

709
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,720
complex one you know you make it make a

710
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,279
one sent by the boss okay

711
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,080
with a very close email

712
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,039
domain

713
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,480
and you will see

714
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,440

you will see the results and people

717
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
hopefully i mean some of them will have

718
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,559
the the right behavior but uh

719
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,399
i mean some you know if you make it

720
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,720
tricky it can be very tricky

721
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,039
for the people okay

722
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360

click how many people are clicking and

725
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,520
clicking on the fishing line it really

726
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,279
depends on quality okay if you get

727
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,080
something with a i don't know dhl you

728
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,600
get the wrong order i mean everyone

729
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,919
knows this is a fake now if you start to

730
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,880
make it a little bit tricky you may have

731
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,960
interesting results if i can say that

732
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,120
any more questions for eric

733
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,880
hello so um i spoken with a ceo who

734
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,279
organized a phishing campaign

735
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,240
and he told me the union asked for

736
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,399
psychological support for people

737
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:02,000
following the drug

738
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,120
and

739
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,080
there was surprised but actually people

740
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,039
used

741
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,039
this psychological support

742
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,840
and was ashamed or felt guilty

743
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,120
for being foreign

744
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,039
do you have any experience inside about

745
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,559
that

746
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,640
no that's what i was mentioning don't

747
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,700
blame

748
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,279
[Music]

749
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,880
you know if you if you have a kid then

750
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,120
you start learning uh by uh running on a

751
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,200
bicycle and you fall and you say why in

752
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
four that's all yeah i'm not sure we'll

753
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,120
go back on the bicycle

754
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,039
so

755
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:38,080
that's

756
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,159
no i never had such thing but it's

757
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:42,000
interesting to see how people can you

758
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,120
know

759
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,600
feel uh responsible for that yeah of

760
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,120
course

761
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,159
again

762
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,480
as mentioned it really depends uh

763
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
i mean of course if

764
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,200
the people

765
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,399
yeah

766
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,399
if it was an easy fishing i mean i would

767
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,559
say but again i mean

768
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,559
if you have a night population of your

769
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,240
audience which feel like this after a

770
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,399
fishing campaign i would say there is a

771
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,960
company culture issue

772
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,919
sorry for the well i mean that's

773
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:11,840
my personal point of view i mean for me

774
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,039
i you know exercise it's a game again

775
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,120
fishing a fishing campaign should be a

776
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,760
game okay i mean the goal is not to

777
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,840
blame the guy who kicks the link but

778
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
just to understand

779
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,559
yeah to people should be happy to say to

780
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:29,120
the to the security team hey i saw this

781
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,360
officially

782
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,520
it's probably a campaign or whatever but

783
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,520
it doesn't matter but

784
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,919
people should be happy to uh to declare

785
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,760
and even if they click on the link and

786
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,840
potentially put their

787
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,000
credential or whatever

788
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,799
okay it's not good but at least

789
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,159
i always say

790
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,480
i mean if you do a mistake inform

791
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,279
security okay it's better i mean don't

792
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,080
be ashamed or don't try to hide because

793
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,240
as we know one day or the other if it

794
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,000
was a real fishing

795
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,240
lane it can come back on the company

796
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,559
situation so

797
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,840
yeah

798
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,960
i didn't heard such a issue but uh

804
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,679

i make it quick to get a lot of

808
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,240
questions so

809
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,240
yes

810
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,960
hi thanks for the talk and uh yeah i

811
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,600
have a question related to um employees

812
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,960
sometimes

813
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,480
does not

814
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,360
see

815
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,200
security as nile as an ali because

816
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,919
they are putting in place some controls

817
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,159
that slow down the development teams and

818
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:50,460
and

819
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,760
[Music]

820
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,039
and other controls to unlock uh usb

821
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,120
parts of

822
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,120
blacklist some applications and the list

823
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,320
is long and sometimes they just avoid

824
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,000
going back to the security when they

825
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,919
have an issue they just solve it by

826
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,679
their own by deploying a tool or using

827
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,679
the software which was forbidden by the

828
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,480
security team

829
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,039
what is your thought

830
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,039

831
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,399

832
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,158

industry i would say again you uh again

834
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,480
what i mean

835
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,519

00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,559
start-up but a kind of a usual habit

845
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,000
so

846
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,360
but again

847
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,279
if you um

848
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,440
if you bring example okay for example

849
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,159
you take a software okay i i don't know

850
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,559
you say i has a company i they don't

851
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
want i install i don't know i give a

852
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,200
crazy name with seven zip or whatever or

853
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,279
whatever a kind of

854
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,440
non-official tool

855
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,440
but then you find example where in five

856
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,720
non-official tools i mean you have

857
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,279
plenty of applications on the news you

858
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,360
have a lot of applications which are

859
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,880
on course uh app store which are

860
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,039
fake one with risk and we know the

861
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,279
security

862
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,480
vulnerabilities and we know potentially

863
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,600
how it was

864
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
used by a cyber criminal so if you give

865
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,840
examples like this people might say yeah

866
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,240
okay i understand that i don't have to

867
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,279
do

868
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,799
anything within my it come by my company

869
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,320
infrastructure

870
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,240
on the other end um

871
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,120
you should explain yeah i mean

872
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,039
i see that also sometimes you should

873
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,159
explain

874
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:02,080
uh you should try to find solutions with

875
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,320
them if people say okay i want to do

876
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,960
that but i cannot do it okay so you say

877
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
okay i take that i mean we take that on

878
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,119
account maybe we put that in place next

879
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,040
year in the meantime please follow the

880
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
normal rules and so on

yeah

883
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,760
yeah you have to explain

884
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,918
i think a good thing uh as we mentioned

885

before is to give example on what can

886

happen if people are not doing it

887
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,239
correctly you know people say okay uh

888
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,560
