00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,199
[Applause]

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:18,480
hello

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,000
i'm michael

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,920
from kaspersky

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,840
um

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,240
i decided to take

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
a bit of a

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,960
more general approach

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,800
that's why also the title is noise and

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,079
signals

12
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:35,920
so we're walking through

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,719
some

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,640
from my perspective interesting things

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
and i hope you enjoy it as well

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,200
uh first of all that's the only slide

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,399
for that

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,239
i'm with the global research and

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,640
analysis team i'm heading the european

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,680
part

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
um our core competence basically is

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
we're doing investigations and research

23
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,920
into apts targeted attacks highly

24
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,800
sophisticated attacks so all kind of i

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,640
would say the fun stuff right

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
and that's all what we're doing mostly

27
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,799
we're also looking into technologies and

28
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,240
stuff like that

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,680
and out of that i give you some

30
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
insights

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,400
um before we start

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,479
i was thinking before

33
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,040
is that loud enough

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,920
okay

35
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
because here i don't have a monitor

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
one thing which i find interesting is

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,240
that

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
people especially in it are very

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
creative i mean most of the people in my

40
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,600
team

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,240
are creative have creative interests

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
some do besides that deep tech stuff

43
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,399
also video production photos all kind of

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,280
art music

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:52,960
so am i

46
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,360
i also enjoy that stuff

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,399
which

48
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,560
brings me back the connection as well

49
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,560
with science fiction

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,880
maybe some of you like doctor who who

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,640
does someone likes doctor who ah good

52
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
you know the original episodes were

53
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,480
released in 1963 that's of course long

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
before when i was born

55
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
and i guess uh

56
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,959
true for many of you

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,120
but the interesting fact is not doctor

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,040
who itself

59
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,800
but something which happened in 1958

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,599
and that is also kind of a core of this

61
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,720
idea

62
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,879
for giving this talk

63
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
so what happened in 1958

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
in

65
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,599
uk

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,560
the

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,480
so-called bbc

68
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,800
radio workshop was created

69
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
where crazy people

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,280
interesting people highly intelligent

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
people

72
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
like delia derbyshire daphne aurum

73
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
which were very famous for

74
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,400
very

75
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,200
new kind of electronic music we're

76
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
talking about 1958 at that time there

77
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,319
were no synthesizers there were no

78
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,200
electronic music equipment at all

79
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
so these people were using everything

80
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,720
which was possible out of the so-called

81
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,480
test equipment environments like

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,840
oscillators filters amplifiers you're

83
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
usually using in signal transmissions

84
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,319
tvs all kind of that stuff

85
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,840
combined with

86
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,239
back then the recording devices which

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,159
are these real-to real-to-real

88
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,640
the

89
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,319
great-great-grandfathers of tapes

90
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,760
uh here to create electronic music

91
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
and back then they were creating this

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
very famous and new style intro of

93
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
doctor who which has this electronic

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,720
touch this atmospheric things

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,840
and as i myself were very interested

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
into music electronic music not only

97
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,000
listening but also making for myself

98
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,319
just as a hobby

99
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,400
i digged a lot into that so i bought

100
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,879
also a lot of crazy stuff and one of the

101
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,640
most outstanding

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,920
are these so called login amplifiers

103
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,959
these are analog ones very very old from

104
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,279
the 60s whatever

105
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,759
16 inch devices and you have all these

106
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,479
buttons and knobs and stuff to like

107
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,000
adjust things

108
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
i use it for making music because

109
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,800
they're

110
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,199
really giving good sound disturbing

111
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,280
stuff and things like that

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,680
but originally in lab environments and

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,960
in physics

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
they're used for so-called signal

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,320
recovery

116
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,880
so imagine you have a signal which is

117
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,360
completely trapped into noise

118
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
and you want to get that signal out of

119
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,160
this random noise from whatever you use

120
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,040
them to filter out the noise and you get

121
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
the clean signal you can measure so it's

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,560
super interesting very crazy stuff

123
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
it's not very heavy and i have quite a

124
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
lot of them so that's my

125
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
big favorite one there is another one

126
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,479
which is a

127
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,400
two-phase vector

128
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,800
yeah crazy login amplifier

129
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,600
and

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,840
i think especially something what these

131
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,160
devices are doing we're also trying to

132
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
do

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,520
we dig through all of this noise all of

134
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
this random stuff which is going around

135
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,320
and finding these signals the

136
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,800
interesting pieces the stuff which is

137
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,919
interesting to us to our job in order of

138
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,160
course and outside it's the good course

139
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,280
we're trying to protect people we find

140
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,120
the interesting malware the advanced

141
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,960
stuff the complex stuff

142
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,440
so we're kind of human

143
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,800
login amplifiers so to say

144
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,039
well

145
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,720
setting the base

146
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
that's always interesting that we're all

147
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,759
on the common ground

148
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,560
i'm not talking about this piece of

149
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,039
noise stuff but i think it's quite

150
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,639
interesting i really like that

151
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,160
screenshot

152
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
who remembers that one

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,600
very easy to see right

154
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,560
yeah it's

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,880
your pc is now stoned though that's from

156
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
1987. back then

157
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,600
the i.t security environment especially

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
in terms of threats and marvel was

159
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,479
easy i mean there were some worms some

160
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
viruses some trojans

161
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,280
nothing super extended nothing super

162
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,160
crazy you had for like floppy disks as a

163
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
transport

164
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,479
uh

165
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:33,440
medium

166
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,520
nowadays this situation looks completely

167
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,960
different

168
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
we're generally talking more about

169
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
the different levels of the threats

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
we're seeing nowadays you have

171
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,160
crimeware stuff which is like the

172
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,639
biggest part

173
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,560
on top the

174
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,199
more targeted more complex professional

175
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
groups behind that

176
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,000
and then the tip of the iceberg is

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,840
0.01

178
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
you really really advanced persistent

179
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,199
threats like

180
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,560
a lot of resources invested

181
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
and also the life cycle of all of that

182
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
developed further and further over the

183
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
years from the beginning it was oh yeah

184
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,360
there is a malware you have the floppy

185
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
in your computer it infected your

186
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,199
computer dot that's it

187
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
um now we're talking depending on the

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,319
different levels of completely different

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,000
life cycles which involves how a certain

190
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,840
attacker or threat is going on and

191
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,440
being active

192
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,080
you have the full cycle

193
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,400
taken on by the more advanced actors in

194
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,440
this field and then just a few certain

195
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,680
steps for the commodities

196
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,000
for the commodities threats because the

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,560
time of investment the resources you're

198
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,759
investing in

199
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,800
is a measurement as well in terms of

200
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,960
like um the complexity the targeted kind

201
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,080
of stuff on these threads

202
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,479
but let's dig through some noise i was

203
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:07,759
thinking

204
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
starting first with

205
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,520
iot and embedded stuff because it's

206
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,680
quite an interesting topic i'm not

207
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,160
talking about hacking the next webcam or

208
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the next router or whatever

209
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
but really

210
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,440
trying to have a bit more focus on the

211
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,680
intelligence side of things

212
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,840
and

213
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,639
observations

214
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,000
we have

215
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
internally a very huge not internally

216
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,719
but externally but it's a project we're

217
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,679
doing

218
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,719
a huge sensor network of honeypots

219
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,200
globally distributed everywhere

220
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,760
and this just gives you a brief overview

221
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,799
about the

222
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,040
amount of traveling we're getting into

223
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
we're talking here in the millions range

224
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,839
right

225
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,160
so 4 million more sometimes 7 million of

226
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,240
hits of malicious hits on our sensors

227
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,320
they're completely passive so it's not

228
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,959
that they're actively trying to gather

229
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
something it's just passive censoring

230
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
and even with that you have these

231
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
numbers so it's a lot of noise right

232
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,720
same for samples that's the amount of

233
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
unique

234
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
based on sha 256 unique samples coming

235
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,399
in per day you have like usually a

236
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,600
hundred

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,040
that's okay

238
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,880
sometimes you have this spike that was

239
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,720
also interesting for me when i created

240
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,760
this graph um but you have these certain

241
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
time frames especially where new

242
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,120
modifications are introduced or new

243
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
attack methods

244
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
are tried out because some new

245
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
vulnerabilities some new

246
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,640
credential leaks of whatever happened

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
which are then incorporated into these

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,440
more automated attacks

249
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,200
so the question is we're of course not

250
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,720
interested in just

251
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
uh the the one brazilian's version of

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,480
mirai that's okay for detection but

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,640
we're looking on the more interesting

254
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
stuff

255
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,839
and especially in this field of iot and

256
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,519
embedded

257
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
what can we get out of there

258
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,560
there are very few

259
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,240
interesting examples not few many

260
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,079
but first we have to dig through all of

261
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,160
the different platforms that's just as a

262
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,519
reference to to make you

263
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,079
feel and see what it really means

264
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,079
working on that all of these unique

265
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,680
samples

266
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,360
it's not just only the intel x86 for

267
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
linux whatever dot or you can easily

268
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,160
handle now you have to take care about

269
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
certain

270
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,279
cpu architectures

271
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,800
uh 32-bit 64-bit little and indeed a big

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,000
endian

273
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
it's not always easy because you have to

274
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
somehow work with all of that

275
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,800
but talking about the examples i added

276
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,920
also

277
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
to some of them the platforms behind

278
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
black energy very famous

279
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
be version 2.

280
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,160
um which targeted

281
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,079
embedded devices

282
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:05,440
it's a very

283
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
it's a complex set of

284
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,680
threat tool sets so to say

285
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,200
which had quite some history behind

286
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,440
the first version it was just a simple

287
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,279
ddos tool

288
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,920
called tactus crimer

289
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,200
which was sold by the creator back then

290
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,959
2007 for about seven hundred dollars

291
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,120
uh the group who bought it changed the

292
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,720
code later on

293
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,040
added a lot of capabilities like these

294
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,760
modules for armament mips

295
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,399
uh along that they also added plugins

296
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
for example for

297
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,800
ics systems

298
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
and

299
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
later on they continued

300
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
and in 215

301
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,240
that's probably why and how many people

302
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,040
at least heard of black energy was

303
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,720
because of the attacks at the power

304
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
plants in ukraine which caused power

305
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,320
outages for several hours

306
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
in a few regions in ukraine that was

307
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,240
like a huge thing

308
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,160
then

309
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,440
in

310
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
218

311
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
vpn filter appeared also this target

312
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,519
into

313
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:22,839
embedded

314
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,399
routers

315
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,720
it's always a bit tricky to say like iot

316
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
it's like embedded network devices stuff

317
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,320
like that

318
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
and interestingly

319
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,480
just based on a

320
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,480
false implemented rc4 algorithm

321
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,240
they had

322
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
the wrong comparison integrated and

323
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,920
because of that same algorithm

324
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
implemented wrongly

325
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
in

326
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
black energy and in vpn filter it was

327
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,160
suggested that this is like the

328
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
next the new malware

329
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,120
from that same group

330
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,200
it has also has like destructive

331
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,440
capabilities and it uses a very

332
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
interestingly

333
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
more or less new kind of c2

334
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,240
communication instead of like plain dns

335
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,120
they used exif over dns

336
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,000
so they were querying from websites

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,120
pictures

338
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,079
use the exif information hidden in there

339
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,160
to derive the ip addresses of the t2

340
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
servers which was quite interesting

341
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,320
especially here not only routers but

342
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
also on nas devices which is kind of

343
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,279
nasty of course because many

344
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,279
businesses store all of their

345
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,240
interesting and important data there

346
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,279
um

347
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,040
followed later on by and 2019 that's

348
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,959
something you probably also read

349
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
nowadays quite often

350
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,360
cyclop cyclops blink

351
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,360
uh which recently was in the news

352
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,279
targeting several hundreds of thousands

353
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:55,920
of

354
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,560
uh specific routers of one vendor

355
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,480
which is also seen as a successor of vpn

356
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,519
filter

357
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,800
and additionally it takes firewalls

358
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,959
so why do i tell you all of that the

359
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,000
interesting thing here is

360
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,399
as opposite to your regular computer and

361
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,440
server

362
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,839
these things you have less control about

363
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,560
it

364
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,720
i mean how many people really are

365
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,199
working on the shells of a router

366
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,800
we are not talking about the big

367
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,199
enterprise routers but the small shitty

368
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,680
ones like the plastic ones

369
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,199
not many right because you have less

370
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,560
control about it

371
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,880
so it's a foothold into the network you

372
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
have full control in most cases about

373
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,720
the whole traffic going on so you have

374
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,199
snippy sniffing capabilities

375
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,519
credential stealing and you can use it

376
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,040
to further on go into the network try to

377
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,959
attack other

378
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,720
like servers and whatever into the

379
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
network you have a foothold there and

380
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,320
it's very persistent because these

381
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,480
things are dumb they

382
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,279
are running 24 7 all the time so when

383
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
you have a footstep in there

384
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,639
it's like game over kind of

385
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,040
that's also why

386
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,480
several groups

387
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,120
use the source code of tsunami which was

388
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,079
released in 2004 that was the earliest

389
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,079
appearance of that

390
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,160
and the source code of tsunami was

391
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,560
released so a lot of people just picked

392
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
the source code

393
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
and created their own modifications out

394
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,880
of that there are nowadays for many many

395
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,720
different platforms

396
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,360
um to target as well like embedded

397
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
devices

398
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,600
one very famous thing it was also abused

399
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,120
in the 2016 hack of the linux mint

400
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,519
were the build servers

401
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,160
were kind of overtaken at least the

402
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,600
download servers

403
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,160
and in the iso files of that linux

404
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
distribution

405
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,519
a tsunami backdoor was implemented

406
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,759
which was quite interesting and huge

407
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,160
which brings me to the next step of

408
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
course

409
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,920
um

410
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,079
in

411
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,199
nowadays i mean i said

412
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,680
the professional groups

413
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
they're using reusing stuff as well

414
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
which is a bit different when we're

415
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,160
talking about specifically ransomware

416
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,639
groups leak however you want to name it

417
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,959
sorry

418
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,120
the air is a bit dry

419
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,800
but ransomware itself it's nothing new

420
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,519
even though we see nowadays a lot of

421
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,399
techniques which are completely like

422
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,079
interesting i have a few examples of

423
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,920
that as well

424
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,360
back in 1989 that was probably or it was

425
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,360
the first

426
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
kind so to say ransomware

427
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
that's how old this history of that

428
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:57,839
stuff is and

429
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,360
from my perspective it's always

430
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,320
interesting to look a bit back and see

431
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,559
developments and the history because

432
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
sometimes it helps you understand the

433
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,439
reality and nowadays and how things are

434
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,760
developing and are

435
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,079
what we're talking about just two kind

436
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,439
of buzzwords big game hunting

437
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,679
which is basically going not behind

438
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
everything what we've seen in the past

439
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,640
like this mass infection

440
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,319
um of

441
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,559
random computers whatever

442
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,880
these groups nowadays are more targeted

443
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
are more interested to go behind the

444
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,720
interesting stuff where the people

445
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,360
really have a pressure to pay

446
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
or whether it's juicy

447
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,320
data which can also be leaked

448
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,640
that's also following to the encrypt and

449
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,120
leak so you have the double side effect

450
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,880
basically

451
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
the groups nowadays are very more

452
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,080
professional

453
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
going on i

454
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,000
mapped it with the

455
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,160
mitre attack framework just as a

456
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,400
reference so there are a lot of

457
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,360
different um steps involved into that so

458
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,600
we're not talking like back then where

459
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
it was just one person creating

460
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,360
something distributing spreading

461
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,120
whatever

462
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,320
but we have certain levels of how these

463
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,039
groups operate and try to get into

464
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,520
networks and do their main goal which is

465
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,799
like the double

466
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,760
um

467
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,120
side of things

468
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
leak and

469
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,280
encrypt to put more pressure on

470
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,520
that's also how the groups operate very

471
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,360
distributed you have a lot of different

472
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
people whose different core competencies

473
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,799
implemented

474
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,360
uh recent leaks also proved this again

475
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
but we also have seen this previously

476
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
because a lot of communication a lot of

477
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
like also outsourcing is happening there

478
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,919
uh for example this point of initial

479
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,200
access their marketplace is just focused

480
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
on the initial excess where people who

481
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
has initial access to certain networks

482
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,120
and whatever selling them to other

483
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,400
actors in order to like when they can do

484
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
their attacks which may be either

485
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,480
ransomware groups for doing their kind

486
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,440
of stuff or also for more way more

487
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
professional actors

488
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
in order to help them doing espionage

489
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,719
operations or whatever

490
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,720
so that's the thing with the

491
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,559
big game operation and there are many

492
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,320
many different groups

493
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,280
um i put it in the uh yeah and the frame

494
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,000
of what we are seeing nowadays because

495
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,240
we have something going on everybody is

496
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,520
aware of that

497
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,559
and

498
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
especially here very famous county

499
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,640
coming groups stormers lockpit

500
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,880
ransom groups where they're also

501
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,039
nowadays positioning themselves in a

502
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,799
political sphere which was completely

503
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,440
new at least to some extent

504
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
um

505
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,000
before they were just yeah they were

506
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,240
even talking together in certain

507
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,880
underground forms and stuff like that

508
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,320
which

509
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,640
is quite an interesting

510
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,960
way to use their power also for

511
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,679
political methods

512
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,679
which brings me a bit further the

513
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,360
political implement

514
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,960
implications are

515
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,679
one next step but

516
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,360
we have these

517
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,360
besides the professional groups which

518
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,960
are more interested into money and

519
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,559
whatever

520
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,919
there's more

521
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,280
there is these

522
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,918
big tips

523
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,840
the

524
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,760
apts and before we dig into that a bit

525
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
more

526
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,760
um

527
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,080
some background

528
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,960
there are different kind of operations

529
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,200
which were going on which we have

530
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,480
observed which we have investigated uh

531
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,600
besides the espionage attacks which is

532
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,480
very common level in that area

533
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,360
also certain cyber sabotage operations

534
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,080
and of course mass manipulations what we

535
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,960
are also seeing nowadays

536
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,200
some of them include maver just to give

537
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
you a brief overview where to point

538
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
something at

539
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
the methods i already said it with the

540
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,360
ransomware groups you have this initial

541
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,320
vector

542
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,559
and the initial vector how to gain and

543
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,840
enter a network and the target is a very

544
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,240
critical point

545
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
that's why

546
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,640
several groups also used and abused the

547
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,880
so-called supply chain

548
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,919
there were many big examples of that

549
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,320
just to give you a few because

550
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,720
they're outstanding each by itself and

551
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,039
that's also one of the main things i

552
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,600
hope you take away

553
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
it's not just

554
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,600
another supply chain attack it's not

555
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,240
just another group they have all

556
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,799
their specifics the methods are very

557
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:56,159
specific

558
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,400
for a certain operation for a certain

559
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
group

560
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,840
uh with nazarang for example that was

561
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,919
quite interesting it's a server

562
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,679
management software

563
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:06,799
and

564
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,600
for

565
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,240
being active after the infection they

566
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,799
were using the asset txt record in the

567
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,080
dns

568
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,000
when for a certain domain which was

569
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,559
derived from the month and the year

570
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,679
based through

571
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,400
algorithm they queried the domain and if

572
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,440
the txt record of that domain is set the

573
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,919
network gets active which is quite an

574
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,760
interesting method

575
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
cc cleaner

576
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,320
uh which was abused with implemented

577
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,679
malware

578
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,280
millions of people were infected

579
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,480
but the second stage was only delivered

580
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,840
to about 40 targets

581
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,559
so all of these millions of devices

582
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,200
reported back to the c2 server

583
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,240
and only handfully picked it interesting

584
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,799
targets especially in the high tech area

585
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,080
and the it

586
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,960
segment were selected and

587
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,600
received the second stage so it's not

588
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,440
only always about

589
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,520
everything which is possible

590
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
but these groups operate targeted and

591
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,720
specific they don't want to go to the

592
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,720
mess they have their goals they have

593
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,559
their plans

594
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,720
and they just use certain methods in

595
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,840
order to get into that

596
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,039
not pedia that's an interesting part

597
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,840
because that was a very destructive one

598
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,840
not patria was this

599
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,240
first observed as a ransomware which

600
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,279
later out uh turned that it's not a

601
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,440
ransomware but a

602
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,039
wiper

603
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,760
cruise the finance development

604
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,520
finance millennium development

605
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
development thing

606
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,200
which delivered soyuz and ransomware

607
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,640
interesting i said i have a few examples

608
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,159
just to give you an overview that there

609
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,679
are different things

610
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,520
havocs was distributed through

611
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,400
trojanized installers targeted ics

612
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
systems

613
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,640
shadowhammer abused the asus live update

614
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,799
utility

615
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:16,159
xcode that was a very very nasty one

616
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,480
because when you were infected with that

617
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,960
and you were using xcode for example for

618
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,720
development of course for ios apps

619
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,440
during the compilation only you couldn't

620
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,840
see the source code in xcode during the

621
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,000
compilation the malicious code was

622
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,400
injected into the build app

623
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,240
so you had no control about it you

624
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,159
couldn't see it it was not in your

625
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
source code project files whatever

626
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,440
and one of the biggest ones or probably

627
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,760
the biggest one definitely was solar

628
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
winds

629
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,200
what this

630
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,320
server

631
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,440
and infrastructure management management

632
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,400
system

633
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,960
was abused to deploy malware

634
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
these are just a few examples but each

635
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,559
one of them had their own specifics and

636
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,440
how they were used and abused

637
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
which is a bit different to the more

638
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,640
common ones like proxy lock on lock for

639
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:15,679
shell

640
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,840
which were abused by many many different

641
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,960
actors

642
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,679
uh really that popped up and increased

643
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,039
every day after they were released

644
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,480
and

645
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,919
some of these yeah vulnerabilities

646
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,919
abused by them

647
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,919
are also kind of oh that's why i put

648
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,120
this example of this firmware updater

649
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,200
the vulnerability in there was 12 years

650
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,559
old

651
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,640
and that's always why you have to think

652
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,200
and be aware of your supply chain what

653
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,760
you're using what you're implementing

654
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,679
where are the connections

655
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:50,799
um

656
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,320
there isn't 100

657
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,039
so

658
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,799
just think about that

659
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,720
the not petty i just mentioned before i

660
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,600
said it's it was a wiper

661
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,559
and

662
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,159
that's going into this destructive stuff

663
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
besides the espionage sabotage

664
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,360
operations where just

665
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,520
data or whole

666
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,919
file disks are wiped completely you

667
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,559
don't have access to anymore whatsoever

668
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,440
that's just an example of one very old

669
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,400
viper from 2012.

670
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,919
just to visualize it a bit what it means

671
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,880
having a wiper

672
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,600
anyone remembers that

673
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,760
so that's basically

674
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,080
a ya rule with the matches of the

675
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,760
similarity between black energy kildist

676
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,039
wiper

677
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
and the

678
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,840
not pedia which i just mentioned before

679
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,080
so we also have links there

680
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,360
you see this throughout the whole

681
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,279
presentation i always show sometimes

682
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,039
some links between

683
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,799
things i mentioned because that's

684
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,520
interesting learning from the past and

685
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,480
seeing certain developments matches

686
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,760
similarities in order to also do kind of

687
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,520
technical attribution and and dig more

688
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
into this whole operation which is

689
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,960
probably going on

690
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,200
not pedia especially was quite

691
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,960
interesting

692
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,039
which is shown here in this

693
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,720
other screenshot

694
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,000
were

695
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,760
basically the id when you have a

696
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,240
ransomware you get an id this id is used

697
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,480
for encryption you have to give it to

698
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,880
that group in order to get like the

699
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
decryption key

700
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,559
and not patia

701
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,039
tried to implement basically the same

702
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,520
therefore most of the people first

703
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,039
thought that it's just another

704
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,159
ransomware account so to say

705
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,640
but the id and the comparison was

706
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,760
completely random so there was no way

707
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,559
at all in the world no way

708
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,960
to do any kind of decryption later on

709
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
again

710
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
so it was a wiper

711
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,720
nowadays if you just follow the news a

712
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
bit so i also added this

713
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,480
what's happening right now

714
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,320
we're just popping up a lot of new

715
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
wipers

716
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,159
um being active in in certain regions

717
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:22,320
especially in ukraine

718
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,240
and even though they're just so many

719
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,840
different new names

720
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,080
each one has very specific abilities

721
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,000
they're not related to each other they

722
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,840
don't share like the code and how things

723
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,960
are wiped so for example whisper gates

724
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,559
overwrites the mbr overrides files

725
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,440
hermetic viper has a very complex ntfs

726
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
parsing implemented and also first tries

727
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,039
to

728
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,679
fragment the data so usually on windows

729
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,600
you do defragmentation in order to like

730
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,320
have other files be kept together on the

731
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,440
blocks

732
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,840
this one does exactly the opposite so

733
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,000
when it's wiping

734
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,240
and you still try to do some forensic

735
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,320
investigations in order to recover some

736
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,200
data

737
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,600
with more fragmented data it's way more

738
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,320
difficult nearly impossible to recover

739
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,559
anything compared to something which is

740
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,840
like defragment and completely on disk

741
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,799
isec wiper overrides disks with random

742
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,679
data this one focuses more on files

743
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,000
completely different operation something

744
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
completely unrelated to each other

745
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
so it's not just another wiper that that

746
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,960
was also something which which which was

747
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,440
a bit sad that the reports are always

748
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,440
there now it's the second wiper now it's

749
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
a third viper now it's the force wiper

750
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,240
or whatever each one of them has a very

751
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,559
unique characteristic from the technical

752
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,279
perspective and because of that

753
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,679
if you're aware of that you are better

754
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,080
prepared in order what to do trying to

755
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,039
override a whole disk takes way longer

756
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,000
it's way more aggressive from the ios so

757
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,039
you know better what to do here and

758
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,600
compared to like just files

759
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,480
or fragmentation operations completely

760
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,120
different things technically

761
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,919
and if you're not able to like

762
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,679
understand it and see it because you

763
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,159
don't have the information it's way more

764
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,480
difficult to defend against that and

765
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,960
that's why it's important to look at the

766
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,200
details of all of these operations going

767
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,360
on

768
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,200
[Music]

769
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,960
let's go a bit to more

770
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,240
not easy stuff but espionage we have

771
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,880
destroyed already a lot

772
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,960
um a very famous example of very very

773
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,320
high tech

774
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,360
used

775
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,000
was definitely satellite toilet it's a

776
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,559
group active for a long time

777
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,440
and it's just i just tried to showcase

778
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,000
you that it's not only the easy or weird

779
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,720
wires like xfc2 communication dns stuff

780
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,240
uh but some sounds also the

781
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,880
communication channels maybe completely

782
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,279
off whatever where you have control

783
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,519
about it or what you can observe about

784
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,480
it

785
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,440
um

786
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,799
here it

787
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
it's a very complex

788
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,480
thing if you're not into satellite

789
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,760
communication

790
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,519
back then you basically had the um data

791
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,679
transmission through a satellite and

792
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,600
then a back channel through the landline

793
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,279
nowadays you have like also two-way

794
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,559
communication on satellites

795
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:32,000
and because of the broadcasting you can

796
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,519
easily

797
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,039
hide

798
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,679
superopsec hide the attacker and the

799
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,720
actors behind that and it's very more

800
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,200
difficult to block any kind of this

801
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,760
communication when it's like broadcasted

802
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,960
over certain areas

803
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,880
others

804
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,720
and that's also why i

805
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,279
try to explain you that learning

806
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,240
from the technical aspects because the

807
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,960
attackers do that as well and one of the

808
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,960
most prominent ones was

809
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
project sauron

810
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,840
which

811
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,559
was learning from a lot of other actors

812
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,760
and operations the technical details

813
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,279
copy pasting it

814
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,559
not

815
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,000
definitely

816
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,200
not

817
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,240
as first place at least as it seemed to

818
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,360
just try to be a false flag operation

819
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,679
but to use these techniques to be more

820
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,399
successful

821
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,080
in the operation

822
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,760
some try to copy paste certain strings

823
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,399
certain operation methods in order to

824
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,440
like false flag if you say if you can

825
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,320
pretend you're actor b but in reality

826
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,480
you're actor a it's

827
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,279
easier for you to like hide

828
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,360
your whole operation everything

829
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,919
but learning from others in order to

830
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,720
advance your techniques you're using

831
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,640
that's like a different level and here

832
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,120
it was documented because we could see

833
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,159
and uh trace it back and it's very

834
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,080
likely that a lot especially on the

835
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,320
professional groups we've seen that as

836
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,200
well that they are learning from other

837
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,840
advanced attacks and operations and

838
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,519
trying to use

839
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,240
similar methods similar techniques in

840
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,720
their operations to be more successful

841
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,519
to advance and be more sophisticated

842
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,440
that's also why we have to learn we have

843
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,000
to learn and know the technical details

844
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,720
and specifications in order to be better

845
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,039
protected it's not just a one-time

846
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,519
operation of the same techniques maybe

847
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,519
used by other groups as well again

848
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,440
a completely opposite example is

849
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,960
something which we're seeing also

850
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,159
nowadays gamma radon is very active

851
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,600
um

852
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,480
at this current uh situation

853
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,640
and gamma radon is quite interesting

854
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,799
um the group exists since about 2013

855
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,360
whatever and they are still

856
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,120
using just

857
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,720
low tech

858
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,079
no zero days no super advanced stuff

859
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:11,760
uh they have their infection um

860
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,839
uh stages

861
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,359
with like old known stuff like the lnk

862
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,679
powershell schedule tasks vb scripts

863
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,960
whatever

864
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,440
very very low tech but they're super

865
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,440
successful as well

866
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,520
for example they're using

867
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,000
this desktop any method since

868
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,239
2017 already it's just they stick to

869
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,560
their low tech nothing advanced so you

870
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,440
also have the attackers and operators on

871
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,159
the other side of the technological

872
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,239
chain

873
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,239
it's difficult to say here advanced

874
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,440
because the

875
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,760
technical aspects are not really

876
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,040
advanced

877
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,280
but they're effective they're still

878
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,280
working

879
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,640
so you have to take care about all areas

880
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,599
not just the most advanced noise not the

881
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,079
most crazy satellite communication

882
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,839
whatever kind of stuff

883
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,720
or very strange vipers defragmentation

884
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,480
whatever

885
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,240
but also about the low-tech stuff

886
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,560
low-hanging fruits

887
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,400
that simple

888
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,079
may be often overlooked i don't know

889
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,599
because they are

890
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,200
successful with that

891
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
still nowadays

892
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,480
right now

893
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,040
as we're talking

894
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,680
more advanced stuff and that's something

895
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,599
which is

896
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,720
sometimes said

897
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,440
which is very very difficult to defend

898
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,040
against it that's why i mention it

899
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,359
because here we're not talking directly

900
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,280
about noise

901
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,440
there is no much noise where it's

902
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,119
difficult to put a sensor on

903
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,240
and i guess everybody here is aware of

904
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,520
like the

905
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,960
um usual execution rings yeah you have

906
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,079
uh user space you have the kernel space

907
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,599
but they're also

908
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,200
the minus levels

909
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,040
the stuff which is below the operation

910
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,520
system

911
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,920
some of them are still

912
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,040
let's say theoretical stuff

913
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
but we also have seen already several

914
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,560
successful attacks

915
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,680
in the uefi for example mosaic regressor

916
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,040
was

917
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:33,760
an

918
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,839
implant into the uefi

919
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,320
and we're not talking

920
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,520
about the esp the afe system partition

921
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,880
on the disk we're talking about the av

922
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,800
on the spi flash rom on the main board

923
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
hardware

924
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
you can reinstall you can change to this

925
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,040
whatsoever as long as you have this main

926
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,240
board the stuff is there

927
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,359
that kind of stuff

928
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
mosaic regressor

929
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,599
had an implementation with certain

930
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,520
drivers

931
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,599
going into

932
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,800
the av boot chain

933
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,920
dropping

934
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,960
into the windows operation system and

935
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,680
the startup folder a file which was then

936
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,760
executed every time you boot up the

937
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,720
system

938
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
you can reinstall you can change the

939
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,640
dist as i said before no chance

940
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,760
the next level which was

941
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,200
more advanced as moon bones

942
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,680
because they did

943
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,839
they did it more

944
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,640
technically advanced on the level that

945
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,000
they directly went into the dxe

946
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,960
they put an implant into the dxe itself

947
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
and not interacting with that which is

948
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,280
like the core one of the core modules of

949
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,200
the uefi

950
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:58,160
and they didn't drop a file just for

951
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,680
execution

952
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,680
the whole operation on the windows

953
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,560
system was fileless no traces on this

954
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,560
and was just operating in memory

955
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,400
so have your stuff ready to also check

956
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,240
all of that stuff as well on the spi

957
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,119
spi is tricky like this is really really

958
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,800
low level low low low low low level

959
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,839
so you have to have specific we have a

960
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,480
scanner for that uh which is a firmware

961
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,440
scanner

962
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,440
um which we also use in these

963
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,480
investigations in order to detect that

964
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,440
and extract that firmware and go into

965
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,920
the investigation but this is something

966
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,800
which

967
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,359
probably not everybody really has

968
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,800
um

969
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
in their mind under scope

970
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,720
and this is something you usually don't

971
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,960
care about because this is really low

972
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
level but this is a

973
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,480
persistence level

974
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,359
one million right

975
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,560
exchange all your mealwords no you don't

976
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,440
uh the problem here is for both of them

977
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
it's not really clear how the initial

978
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,599
infection vector happened

979
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,560
um

980
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,680
because

981
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,079
in this specific case you could only see

982
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:17,280
it afterwards when you read out the spi

983
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,040
and dig into the firmware when you have

984
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,240
a certain

985
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,760
um

986
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,280
yeah when you think that there is

987
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,720
something wrong

988
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,880
because also this kind of investigation

989
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
it's not something you're just doing

990
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,079
easily right

991
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,920
you really have to get your hands on

992
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,160
it's nothing you can scale up in your

993
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,040
network for a thousand computers easily

994
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,680
um that's why this persistence method is

995
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,680
like really

996
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,960
advanced and complicated

997
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,320
in the end

998
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,079
with all that

999
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,359
what can we do

1000
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,160
we're not lost completely not i don't

1001
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,040
i'm

1002
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,440
very optimistic and that's also why

1003
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
usually when i talk to like regular

1004
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,960
uh non-deep tech people i'm not the bad

1005
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,280
guy i don't want to create fear anger

1006
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,319
whatever

1007
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:09,359
um i'm a positive guy i'm an optimist we

1008
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,280
need to exchange all of that information

1009
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,599
in order to defend because we have the

1010
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,000
abilities to we just need to be aware

1011
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,119
and the awareness is the most

1012
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,960
important thing first of all because if

1013
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,280
you're not aware of how can you start

1014
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,119
defending against

1015
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,680
so one tool which is very

1016
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,839
essential of course you may have a lot

1017
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,160
of tool chains that's okay

1018
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,280
um but one core tool of course is yara

1019
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,839
because it really helps a lot with

1020
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:38,960
hunting

1021
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,520
and also trying to find the similarities

1022
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,440
what i just mentioned before

1023
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
and i just wanted to give one other

1024
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,079
example because it was very famous

1025
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:50,480
and also very interesting from a

1026
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,280
technical perspective

1027
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,359
the name already says it wanna cry

1028
00:40:57,359 --> 00:40:58,480
so

1029
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,880
the upper one is wannacry the lower one

1030
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,119
is

1031
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,560
right

1032
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,319
correct

1033
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,560
um so that's exactly

1034
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,000
uh the link which was uh tweeted um

1035
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,040
by that employee from google

1036
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,440
when we had a look at you could see that

1037
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,400
this is

1038
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,720
the code parts of a custom ssl

1039
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,440
implementation which basically shows a

1040
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:26,640
link

1041
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,400
between these

1042
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,119
two operations

1043
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,040
and if you just remember all the other

1044
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
similarities and things i showed you

1045
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,760
before

1046
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,280
this is something

1047
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,079
to go for as well because it's always

1048
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
good to put in links to learn to see the

1049
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,240
similarities to follow the traces

1050
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,200
because then maybe you can get even more

1051
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,839
intelligence out of and know what to

1052
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,040
defend against probably what to do maybe

1053
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,119
who's hunting you or who's going after

1054
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,640
you

1055
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,480
there are a lot of different methods i

1056
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,680
just

1057
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,720
try to put it like as simple as possible

1058
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,280
and to a small overview just for you to

1059
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,400
take away

1060
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
probably most of that most of you people

1061
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,079
are already doing

1062
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,400
uh what you can do in terms of data

1063
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,240
enrichment because that's an essential

1064
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,079
part

1065
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,560
that's the technical side of things

1066
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,400
then going into

1067
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,040
the micro attack framework for example

1068
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,359
for the methodologies getting more

1069
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,960
intelligence about how certain

1070
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,520
operations are conducted

1071
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,440
who are maybe certain groups or

1072
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,240
operations which are going on in order

1073
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,160
to be on top

1074
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,680
and

1075
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,599
protect and defend right

1076
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,940
that's basically what we're up to

1077
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,280
[Music]

1078
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:51,440
in the end some last words

1079
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,359
don't underestimate the human factor

1080
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,640
these are photos i've taken myself

1081
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,640
i'm flying quite often also here i came

1082
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,920
by plane

1083
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,400
and when you go into the business

1084
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,440
lounges there at airports

1085
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,960
people

1086
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,440
in that level may not always be super

1087
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,240
aware or know what security means

1088
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,720
so this picture basically is i think it

1089
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,400
was in frankfurt or munich in the

1090
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,440
business launch and one guy in the suit

1091
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,160
he just stood up he left his notebook

1092
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:28,880
you can see it's open um the screen is

1093
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,280
from outlook he was connected through

1094
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,240
vpn he had some emails open and he went

1095
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,400
to the restroom

1096
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,640
not just to wash the hand and be back in

1097
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,839
30 seconds even 30 seconds is like way

1098
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:42,880
too long

1099
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,480
but he really i was sitting next to that

1100
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,960
i sat down and was waiting for him to

1101
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,400
come back

1102
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,560
it was nearly 15 minutes

1103
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,079
imagine what you can do with an open

1104
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,440
notebook in 15 minutes

1105
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,160
so

1106
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
of course

1107
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,200
as technicians i am technician we can do

1108
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,839
a lot of things protecting the network

1109
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:08,800
fighting against super crazy technical

1110
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,440
stuff because that's fun right that's

1111
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,880
driving

1112
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,599
but in the end we also have to take

1113
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,440
into account that there are humans in

1114
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,720
the end on the other side of the

1115
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,200
notebooks which may not be that deep

1116
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,599
technical as we are may not have the

1117
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,359
understanding and knowledge what we have

1118
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,720
so we have to do something about that

1119
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,480
we have to train them

1120
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,160
we have to put the right settings and

1121
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
this is also it's it's not only a

1122
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
question about training by the way

1123
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,400
it's i'm not a big fan of just blaming

1124
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,520
the user

1125
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,960
that's the wrong way

1126
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,240
blaming the user wrong way not good

1127
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,000
you have to take

1128
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,920
them with you and you can do security

1129
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,359
policies

1130
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,960
screen lock for example there was no

1131
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,839
screen lock the screen didn't lock after

1132
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,839
two minutes whatever inactivity or

1133
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:01,440
whatever no

1134
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,839
it was completely on for nearly 15

1135
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:04,720
minutes

1136
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,720
that same way

1137
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,440
it's not only a problem what about user

1138
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,760
it's a problem about wrong security

1139
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,400
policies as well

1140
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,680
there are many many different methods

1141
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,359
you can use

1142
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,839
employees as i just said before

1143
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,079
advanced technologies management

1144
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,720
vulnerability tracking i said it was the

1145
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,280
supply genetics

1146
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,359
really go into your stuff

1147
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:36,240
be aware of what's going on

1148
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,359
um

1149
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,480
it's not always as simple i know it but

1150
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,560
the tools are there

1151
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,079
it's not

1152
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,960
that we have to fight with like bare

1153
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,760
hands against the beer we have all the

1154
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,720
tools and technologies you just need to

1155
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,920
use them

1156
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,680
in the right way

1157
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,839
you have to get them and use them

1158
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:05,119
next time maybe i'm talking about some

1159
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,680
other devices i have at home i have a

1160
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,680
huge rack full of that

1161
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,839
and if you liked it please follow me on

1162
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,160
twitter if you have any questions here

1163
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,520
or i'm still down at the

1164
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,920
we have a booth

1165
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,040
i'm around there outside whatever feel

1166
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,839
free to ping me

1167
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:28,500
thanks and

1168
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:36,000
[Applause]

1169
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,520
so we definitely have a few minutes for

1170
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,640
questions so if anybody has some

1171
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,599
questions i'll pass the mic around

1172
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,960
i'm super good on time

1173
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,240
thanks thanks for the presentation it's

1174
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,079
really interesting topic

1175
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,040
you in one slide you saw a

1176
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,680
what is the presentation of apts in the

1177
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:58,160
attack i think in the tax i think it was

1178
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,800
like 0.01

1179
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,880
but from those uh how many of them are

1180
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,280
really really interesting as you saw at

1181
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,359
the at the end of the presentation

1182
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,760
because there are some groups like dooku

1183
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:13,599
equation or gauss that are really highly

1184
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,920
technically speaking they are very

1185
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,040
interesting

1186
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,079
but i'm probably sure that most of them

1187
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:20,880
are

1188
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,359
almost like crap software

1189
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,960
so how many or more or less how many of

1190
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,760
those are pretty interesting technically

1191
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,240
speaking

1192
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,160
uh to be honest

1193
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:36,839
many of them if not all of them

1194
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,640
because each group develops their own

1195
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:43,040
techniques their own methods and as i

1196
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,319
said before

1197
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,400
some groups learning from other groups

1198
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,800
this is not only on the apt level this

1199
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,119
is on all levels also professional

1200
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,680
attackers climber groups whatever trying

1201
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,000
to learn from the big guys and therefore

1202
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,520
you have to

1203
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,520
learn and go through all of the

1204
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,400
techniques used which are public

1205
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,720
because if you know about it the

1206
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,720
attackers may also about it and vice

1207
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,559
versa

1208
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,559
so all of them are interested all of

1209
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,400
them is something to go through when

1210
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,960
we're talking about security it's not

1211
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,160
only ah this is just someone attacking i

1212
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,440
don't know

1213
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,920
political institutions and you're in a

1214
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:23,760
pharmacy or whatever

1215
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,400
no because these techniques may be used

1216
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,720
the next day against your operation as

1217
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:29,920
well

1218
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,680
it's that simple okay thank you very

1219
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,880
much thanks for the question hi very

1220
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,040
nice talk by the way thanks

1221
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,079
so uh

1222
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,920
i was really interested in the moon

1223
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,920
phase and

1224
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,000
and especially like the the motivation

1225
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,559
of your talk which is discerning signal

1226
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,960
by noise so the attack seems like

1227
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,880
extremely sophisticated

1228
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,280
so how do you guys like

1229
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,440
try to spot this i mean if you are on

1230
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,359
the user level how do you understand

1231
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:01,119
this executing just in ram or if you try

1232
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,880
to instrument the firmware how do you

1233
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,079
understand it is it scale escalates so

1234
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:09,040
up there you know it's like it seems

1235
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,599
very semantically difficult to actually

1236
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,920
understand what is going on and the the

1237
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,440
following question is how how

1238
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:20,000
this thing helps how it spreads you know

1239
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,160
like it's someone working for others

1240
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,240
which actually

1241
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,760
does this i mean i said that's what i

1242
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,440
can say whatever but do you understand

1243
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,319
what i mean right yeah

1244
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,119
so first of all it is really tricky

1245
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,559
to

1246
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,520
know

1247
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,920
or identify such attacks

1248
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,480
you have to work a lot of with anomalies

1249
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,359
i mean memory you can scan if you do it

1250
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,520
you have to do it that's the simple

1251
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,680
point and then you also have at least

1252
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,520
that point of communication

1253
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,160
communication is also very tricky

1254
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,960
um because at least at some points they

1255
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,559
may need to talk to some c2 the problem

1256
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,240
is nowadays

1257
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,400
most of the infected devices do not

1258
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,359
necessarily directly talk to a c2 but

1259
00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,920
they may talk to other relays

1260
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,800
in the same network and then use just

1261
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,960
one hub for example in order to

1262
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,520
communicate to the c2 so the whole

1263
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:17,359
situation also on the communication

1264
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:20,000
level and the network is very complex so

1265
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,240
you have to do a lot of monitoring and

1266
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,319
that's always the key

1267
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,680
monitoring

1268
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:28,400
monitor as much and everything as

1269
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,839
possible

1270
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:32,960
store it and try to find exactly these

1271
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,760
links i know it's uh it sounds not easy

1272
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,200
but it is

1273
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,240
it's just tapping it's just storing all

1274
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,200
the information and then trying to match

1275
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,559
it get threat intelligence providers

1276
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,720
which deliver a lot of enrichments like

1277
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:50,240
that was one of the last slides in

1278
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:53,280
richmond's and then try to make sense

1279
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,400
all of the data that's exactly the point

1280
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:58,480
try to find these signals and that's

1281
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,800
first of all store data

1282
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,240
many many

1283
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,040
do exactly that not they don't store the

1284
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,119
data they don't have enough sensors and

1285
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,520
monitoring installed so they don't know

1286
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,599
and are not able to tell what's really

1287
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,359
going on in the networks and on the

1288
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,000
computers and that's the first thing to

1289
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,119
start with

1290
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,000
and then advance that do the monitoring

1291
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,880
have kind of a suck if you're too small

1292
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,559
get a managed sock

1293
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,200
no problem and then advance on that and

1294
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,760
then you have the abilities at least

1295
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,000
to know that there's something strange

1296
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,599
and when you know that there's something

1297
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,000
strange you can go on there are

1298
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,559
researchers there are differe guys who

1299
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:39,920
just come

1300
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,839
investigate and they have the

1301
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,559
capabilities to go into that like spi

1302
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,200
for example and check that

1303
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,640
nobody needs to be able to do that in a

1304
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:54,480
in a in a corporation you can have

1305
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,640
external experts for that no problem

1306
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,319
other questions

1307
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:09,839
find me later if you have any

1308
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:11,200
exactly it's another round of applause

1309
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,440
for marco

1310
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,440
thanks
