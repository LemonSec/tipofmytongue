[Music]

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
thank you good morning

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,880
good morning geneva

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,880
how do you enjoy the conference so far

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
is it good fun

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,080
cool

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,599
cool

8
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,480
so uh if you've been here in 2019 you

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
might remember me i was the replacement

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,238
keynote

11
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:33,760
as it happens i'm the replacement

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
keynote again

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,680
so if we're going to do this again next

14
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,239
year i'll have to bring up something new

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,320
i'm out of topics afterwards but here we

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,719
go so i'm going to talk about online

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,399
voting or e-voting as we call it in

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,879
switzerland um this is a talk about

19
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,120
democracy in the wider sense

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
as you can see on my presentation slide

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,120
the people fighting for democracy now in

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,320
europe

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,280
and

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,840
even the struggle for online voting is

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,079
real it's a it's a real fight and this

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,080
is about our democracy this is about the

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,159
base of democracy if you don't get the

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,880
voting right we can pack up and stop

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
this experiment

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,119
so it's important we get this right and

31
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:14,400
it is secure

32
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,479
and we as a public society we trust in

33
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,000
it so it's worth looking at it in detail

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
with an i.t security perspective

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
it's more than it is security but

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,200
security apparently has a major role to

37
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,799
play in this

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,960
good what are we going to do today

39
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
i give you an overview over the

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,119
vast history of 20 years of online

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,880
voting in switzerland

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,880
i'll give you a new perspective on the

43
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,119
events of 2019 if you're not familiar

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,200
with those events you will be after the

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,159
talk

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,479
i'm going to cover an expert dialogue

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,960
that happened after the events of 2019

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,200
last year switzerland run a public

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,840
consultation on the new regulations so

50
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
2019 was a mess then they invited

51
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,399
scientists came up with a report then

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,560
they wrote a new draft regulation that

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,200
was put in public consultation that is

54
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,719
finished and as we speak they're

55
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,878
preparing the new

56
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,840
final

57
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,400
official regulation and then i'm going

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,920
to make some ridiculous predictions

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,280
about the future

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,280
that will several months down the lane

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
will already be completely ridiculous

62
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,720
because there's so many plot twists in

63
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,599
here

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,840
it's not going to work out but

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,680
you shouldn't let a chance to make a

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,280
fool of yourself pass

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,560
and take

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,879
good who am i so i'm christian fellini

69
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,480
i'm historian by profession that's why

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,239
i'm interested in voting

71
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,400
but i'm also a security engineer i lead

72
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
an announce

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
project so

74
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,160
a security project about web application

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,480
firewalls that play a minor role in

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,959
online voting it doesn't matter too much

77
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,640
but lately i've also become an election

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
worker so physical vote counting i do

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,959
that and i'm blogging about this as well

80
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
on my website safari is only in german

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
but i might translate this to french and

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,599
english as we move down the road

83
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,599
i'm going to do the next blog post next

84
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,879
week because we're going to count

85
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
elections in the canton of bern on

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
sunday i'm doing this for the first time

87
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
very interesting

88
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,599
so you might want to follow me on

89
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,440
twitter because i tweet about that i

90
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,080
read about online security stuff

91
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,920
my ova's project

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,800
and e-voting if there are news around it

93
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
you could say i'm wearing many different

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,280
helmets with e-voting as we move through

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
this history i'll pop up at various

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,319
spots

97
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,080
and surprising spots probably for some

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
of you i used to bring a helmet in 2019

99
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,799
to my keynote and i've been told i

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
should have brought it again but with

101
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,239
online voting there is not so much to

102
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,440
talk about

103
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,519
helmets but apparently i have a suit of

104
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
armor at home

105
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,159
good

106
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,400
so

107
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,959
e-voting uh who among in the room is

108
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
voting in switzerland who has a swiss

109
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
passport

110
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,480
okay we have a mixed international

111
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,439
audience i would guard all

112
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
that means i need or i will explain one

113
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,920
or two things about switzerland

114
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
democracy

115
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
oh yeah i will explain one or two things

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,360
about swiss democracy first for the

117
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,519
international uh audience

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,680
we vote like four times a year

119
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,600
so in a given country usually do like

120
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,759
every two or four years

121
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,759
on the province level

122
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,479
country level

123
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,000
but in switzerland we do this four times

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
a year

125
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,919
and that of course gives a fast pace

126
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,240
that means a there is a serious need to

127
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,720
make a lean process

128
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,680
uh

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
online voting helps you do this four

130
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,479
times a year

131
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
and uh we have a lot of experience with

132
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,160
this because we do this four times a

133
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
year and when you do something new you

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,639
get a lot of test runs because you can

135
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,960
try this out four times a year estonia

136
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,479
has been very strong in online voting

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,639
for example and they do it every two or

138
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,840
four years and they've been doing this

139
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
for 15 years now so they have done like

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,800
10

141
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
10 15 elections with this

142
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,919
but we do 10 or 15 elections in two four

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,080
years in switzerland or votes so we have

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,840
a lot of experience and it's a good test

145
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,320
bet to do this actually

146
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,400
and because this happens so often

147
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
people in switzerland do

148
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,120
mail-in ballots we vote

149
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,600
physically we still do so on paper but

150
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,759
then we put in a post

151
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,560
there are very few people to go on to

152
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
the voting office on a sunday morning in

153
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,880
switzerland 95

154
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,719
more or less vote by mail

155
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,720
and that is as you can imagine

156
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
inherently insecure we introduced this

157
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,320
25 30 years ago and people just accept

158
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,960
it as a given but as a security person

159
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
you need to think about the security

160
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,600
implication of throwing your vote into a

161
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
mailbox and hoping it will be counting

162
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,880
so that is a problem

163
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
and because

164
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,000
mailball voting is so well established

165
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,880
online voting is not such a big step

166
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
it's just the same material entered into

167
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,639
the browser

168
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,919
instead of thrown into the inbox so this

169
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,160
the gap or the step is relatively small

170
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,919
when compared to a country where you

171
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,560
line up in a queue on sunday morning to

172
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,400
place your vote for switzerland is

173
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,199
relatively close

174
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,319
now we start to do this online voting 20

175
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,520
years ago

176
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
and it people usually hate it security

177
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,319
people hate it so who

178
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
thinks that we should stop online voting

179
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
this is supposed to be the majority in

180
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,319
the room

181
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,880
okay it's a surprisingly low number of

182
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
people who think we should stop this

183
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,440
immediately i would go just 20

184
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,919
usually it's more

185
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,240
but okay

186
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
as we enter this apparently uh

187
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
as i.t security professionals you know

188
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
this is going to be problematic this is

189
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,080
a conference with a lot of talks about

190
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,400
vulnerabilities and weaknesses it's no

191
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
different with online voting of course

192
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,120
it's difficult to get this right and

193
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
doing a presentation after 20 years and

194
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
still no online voting in switzerland as

195
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
we speak right now

196
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,319
means there's been a lot of security

197
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
problems along the way

198
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,840
because it's so so difficult to do this

199
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,319
and you can sum up

200
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,520
the arguments against online voting

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,800
in a statement like this by bruce

202
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,319
schneier it's a couple of years ago in

203
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,720
the atlantic he would say we simply

204
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,199
can't build an internet voting system

205
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,759
that is secure against hacking because

206
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
of the requirement for a secret ballot

207
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,199
so you want security and integrity of

208
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,080
the vote you want to trust the result

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,560
but you also want to provide a secret

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
ballot so people should not know

211
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,000
what everybody else has been voting this

212
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
is really important

213
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,400
however

214
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,520
these two desires are like two magnets

215
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,120
that you want to push together that's

216
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,639
really really hard and bruce either

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,759
comes to conclusion it's not going to

218
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,160
work it's impossible to do now the

219
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
people pursuing online voting will say

220
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,520
it's really hard but it can be done and

221
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,599
that is the whole conflict about this

222
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,039
and if you're not doing this right you

223
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,560
lose the trust and if you lose the trust

224
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,639
in election results then you're in the

225
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,160
trump election

226
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,680
two years ago

227
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,120
that is the problem that is inherent

228
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,639
risk i mean that was a demonstration

229
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,800
what happens when people stop lose the

230
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,479
trust in election results so this is

231
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,479
really really important and i think

232
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,960
bruce nyers is the key of the argument

233
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,039
here and now we could abandon and say

234
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,639
it's a shitty idea it's not going to

235
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,639
work let's stop this however there are

236
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,479
good arguments in favor as well and that

237
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,880
makes it so tricky especially at least

238
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,279
for me i think it's really hard to tell

239
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,360
what you should do so what do we have is

240
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
arguments in favor of online voting we

241
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,279
have citizens livings abroad more than

242
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,240
10

243
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
of the voting population

244
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,480
in switzerland is living abroad there

245
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
have to vote by mail and that works

246
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
nicely in france it works nicely in

247
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,720
germany europe maybe united states but

248
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,959
when you live in mexico or paraguay it's

249
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,240
not going to work

250
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
you have four weeks to deliver the mail

251
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,480
ballot from switzerland to

252
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,279
some

253
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,600
remote country and the same four weeks

254
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
it has to return back to switzerland and

255
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
land in the ballot box and that's not

256
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,279
working

257
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,880
that's why they complain and say we have

258
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,760
a right to vote four times a year on a

259
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
federal level in switzerland and we're

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,920
always late so these people are

261
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,800
effectively disfranchised from the vote

262
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
and that is a secure problem because

263
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
it's like 10 50 percent of the voting

264
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
population

265
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,640
that is

266
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,800
serious problem this is well covered

267
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,000
they're lobbying for this they've been

268
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
loving it for a lot of time people

269
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
acknowledge this but there are more

270
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,600
people

271
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
the visually impaired and quality

272
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
practical voters in numbers that's not

273
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,760
so many

274
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
i would got maybe 15 20 000 in

275
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,279
switzerland however these people are not

276
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,880
getting a secret ballot because a blind

277
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,519
person cannot pencil

278
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,720
the vote

279
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,399
voting slip that's not working so they

280
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,320
need an assistant depending on the

281
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,399
legislation to work under this can be a

282
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,360
friend

283
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,680
or it's an official person from the

284
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
community coming to them that is

285
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,360
assigned so they're not even picking the

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
person they have to trust and i think

287
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
that that is a huge problem i mean they

288
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
get the secret ballot guaranteed

289
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,240
in the constitution in switzerland and

290
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
they're not getting it

291
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,200
so i think that is a serious problem day

292
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
they decided to live in mexico okay go

293
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,959
live with it but they didn't decide they

294
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,040
want to be blind so i think this is a

295
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,079
serious

296
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,399
problem and they're disfranchised from

297
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,839
the vote to a certain extent at least

298
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,440
this franchise from the

299
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,880
secret ballot

300
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,680
next one up the formerly invalid ballot

301
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,399
if you've done voting it's yes no people

302
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,360
usually get this right

303
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
however there are few formal aspects

304
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,000
around it we have a percentage on the

305
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,720
yes no votes that are formally invalid

306
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,640
however when it comes to elections swiss

307
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,760
ballots

308
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,680
are so complicated are you allowed to do

309
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
so complicated things by striking

310
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,279
through replacing names and all that

311
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,519
stuff that a lot of the ballots are

312
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,880
invalid formally embedded they're

313
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,519
dropped this can be up to ten percent in

314
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,640
election again throwing away ten percent

315
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,800
of ballots in an election is a huge

316
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,000
problem from a democratic viewpoint and

317
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,440
of course if the computer does the

318
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,640
checking

319
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,240
in the online voting people say look

320
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
this is illegal you cannot do this do it

321
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,200
as follows

322
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,360
so you don't end up you you don't get

323
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,079
firm formally invalid ballots online

324
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
voting i mean this has they got this

325
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,079
right i mean this is usable usability

326
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,720
management and that works even if

327
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
security has had problems they got this

328
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,440
right and then finally we have the

329
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
security weakness of the physical voting

330
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,640
process because we vote by mail throw it

331
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,480
in in the mailbox and we hope it will

332
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
arrive at the ballot box

333
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,000
and it means the existing

334
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,160
channels the voting channels the voting

335
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,920
by mail and voting physically on sunday

336
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
morning

337
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,360
that has security weaknesses as well

338
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,120
and online voting has different security

339
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,200
weaknesses and you need to balance

340
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,160
together so with all these arguments we

341
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,760
have very strong arguments against

342
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,320
online voting but i think we have pre

343
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
pretty good arguments based on the

344
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,760
constitution

345
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
for online voting and

346
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,079
to clash i haven't made up my mind i

347
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,760
think it's just very very difficult and

348
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,639
we need to take this very carefully

349
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,160
good

350
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,800
let's move on so we start in 2000

351
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,720
one of the first cantons doing online

352
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,800
voting in switzerland has been geneva

353
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,399
where we are right now

354
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,399
and geneva has been very very important

355
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,680
for online voting in switzerland they

356
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,760
have been carrying the torch in front

357
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,519
for more than 10 years

358
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,639
in 2004 a spanish company called seidl

359
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:35,839
entered switzerland and they did the

360
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,920
first online vote in the canton of

361
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
nurjatel you will notice two

362
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,839
french-speaking cantons online voting

363
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
switzerland is a french-speaking thing

364
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
which i think is kind of cool because

365
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,279
usually it's the german speaker think

366
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,880
they'll lead to torture it's not

367
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,760
happening

368
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,800
2009 eight swiss cantons mostly german

369
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,639
speaking councils formed and consortium

370
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,639
together they teamed up and said look

371
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,160
geneva's doing they're all on their own

372
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,800
that's really tough let's join together

373
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,560
let's form a team

374
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,880
and they ordered or

375
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,720
they did a contract the american company

376
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,959
unisys the swiss branch could you please

377
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,680
provide a voting system for us that was

378
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,279
the consortium

379
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,639
and typically in switzerland 2011

380
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,200
federal gently started with the steering

381
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
board so for 10 years

382
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
cantons could experiment try this out a

383
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,279
bit and then after 10 years the federal

384
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,160
say okay let's establish an overview

385
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,120
here steering committee to guide this a

386
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,079
wee bit

387
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
uh what is interesting from a legal

388
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,839
standpoint is

389
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:36,720
that

390
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
the federal

391
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,240
level has nothing to say in voting in

392
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,639
switzerland it's all done on the 26th

393
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,519
canton level they have the authority

394
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,560
however

395
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
with online voting

396
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,800
the federal level gets to impose the

397
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
security

398
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,920
which i think is very smart united

399
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,440
states that's not happening it's a

400
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,279
hundred percent on the province level

401
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,000
the state level switzerland it's on the

402
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,680
province level but when it comes to

403
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
security it's the federal level to

404
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,079
impose security which i think is

405
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,959
relatively nice because burn can say hey

406
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,360
look you guys that is insecure that's

407
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,480
not possible in the united states

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,440
good

409
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,639
so that started in 2011. this moved on

410
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,440
2015 federal elections approaching

411
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,800
several months ahead of the federal

412
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,000
election

413
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,079
the federal chancellor lead chancellor

414
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,160
lee the body supervising the security

415
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,040
say hey you can consortium cantons your

416
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,839
system is

417
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,519
not good enough

418
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,199
but we're okay with your system just

419
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,120
don't use it on a federal level

420
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,920
and the consortium died within weeks or

421
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
days they just oh we're we're out if if

422
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,440
this is not working after six years we

423
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,880
drop it immediately so consortium died

424
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,920
and swiss post entered the game so seidl

425
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,000
has been struggling in the canton of

426
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
nurjatel in switzerland for like 10

427
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,160
years and then this post approached them

428
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,199
and said look actually we we we found

429
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,600
out that people are voting by mail

430
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,760
and we think if somebody's replacing

431
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
that channel we'll lose a lot of letters

432
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,519
that is a lot of business

433
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,800
and

434
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
we want to be the person eating the

435
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,199
letters we want to be

436
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,839
the ones doing online voting so if that

437
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,839
channel disappears or is replaced it has

438
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
to be replaced by ourselves and you guys

439
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
from cycles seem to have a lot of

440
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
knowledge know-how because we're a

441
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
letter company we're logistics company

442
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,440
we're not cryptographers so they joined

443
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,120
and that looked really good because in

444
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,440
2015 swiss post was in no position

445
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,079
whatsoever to develop an online voting

446
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,839
system themselves forget it couldn't do

447
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,240
this know-how wasn't there

448
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,160
and i used to consult swiss post back in

449
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,680
the day and thought hey very good

450
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,800
decision because we're not writing this

451
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,959
so it sounded like a match made in

452
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
heaven you have the voting experts with

453
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,440
the cryptography know-how any of the

454
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,920
logistic experts they know how to

455
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,600
transport letters and how to process

456
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
servers how to run service

457
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,240
because these voting companies doing

458
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,440
this globally they are used to reboot

459
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,000
every four every four years so they go

460
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
into a country set up the system run the

461
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,560
vote and then they leave see you in four

462
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
years guys and that's not how

463
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,839
switzerland works it's an ongoing

464
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,800
process

465
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,959
as cycle found out the hard way so these

466
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:22,639
swiss are always voting

467
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,560
when it when is the maintenance window

468
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,880
for us when can we develop the next

469
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
version because oh it's already the test

470
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
run again but we only voted last week

471
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,800
why do we test run already so this is a

472
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,880
very tight schedule in switzerland and

473
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
they joined with swisspo said look we

474
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
have you covered with the operating you

475
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,199
just do the secure code please

476
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,120
very good joan wenter

477
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,399
and then in 2017 the federal chancellery

478
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,959
or the federal chancellor walter turner

479
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
announced by the next federal election

480
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
2019 i want i think it was like

481
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,959
two-thirds of the cantons to introduce

482
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,360
online voting not for everybody but at

483
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,440
least let's start with test runs in

484
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,000
two-thirds of canton and that was a bang

485
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,799
ba

486
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,319
hey hold on you've been working this for

487
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
15 years and nobody cared and now you're

488
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,160
introducing the two-thirds of the people

489
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,799
so you get immediate resistance i mean

490
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,959
some experts hated this already but

491
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,720
after that announcement

492
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,039
everybody jumped on and said hey hold on

493
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,439
that's really really dangerous and what

494
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,679
we've seen so far we're not satisfied so

495
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,919
you get resistant immediately after that

496
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,919
statement and then is when the no

497
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
e-voting movement really kick-started so

498
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,720
here you see a famous swiss politician

499
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,760
uh he's not known as a security expert

500
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,320
or as a 90 security expert because but

501
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,840
of course he had to talk about this as

502
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
well because everybody was talking about

503
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,200
online voting as well mostly against

504
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,039
online voting beyond 100 articles were

505
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,320
written about online voting in 2017

506
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,600
and 18.

507
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,039
and i got a feeling that three out of

508
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,840
four quoted hernani marquez from the

509
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
swiss branch of the ccc so he was like

510
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,880
all over the place

511
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,640
and the confrontation was really really

512
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
hard i mean the attacks have been

513
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,200
substantial i was attacked

514
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,600
uh personally on twitter and beyond and

515
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,320
many many other people as well and

516
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,200
the feeling was or the battle space was

517
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
dominated by the opposition so against

518
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,799
e-voting like nobody was talking for

519
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,200
e-voting in public

520
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,480
and that would give you the feeling

521
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,160
everybody hates it

522
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,039
but as very often it's a vocal minority

523
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,280
that hates it but they dominate the

524
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,520
space because they're so fierce and so

525
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,720
hard

526
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,880
i put up my helmet from time to time and

527
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
appeared on twitter and said hey look

528
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,240
actually this is really interesting and

529
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,880
they would shoot me immediately so the

530
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,640
sentiment analysis is rather negative

531
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,760
here

532
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,720
good

533
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,600
2018 geneva quits

534
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,880
um

535
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,640
there are a few people who get wet

536
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,720
dreams about what they did to geneva

537
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
because they managed to be on swiss on

538
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,559
the swiss german tv

539
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,799
with a headline geneva e-voting system

540
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,960
has been hacked but that has been a lie

541
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,520
that was not the case absolutely not

542
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,919
however coincidence one or two weeks

543
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:09,360
afterwards geneva said we're going to

544
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,840
quit this why would geneva quit because

545
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,640
the people carrying this quit or work

546
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,440
with

547
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
actually an important person in geneva

548
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,520
has been

549
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,240
oh i'm forgetting the name now

550
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,080
yeah sorry

551
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
thank you so much so pierre mode had his

552
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,840
scandal you're probably familiar with

553
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
and he was one of the people pushing

554
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,760
e-boating and the moment he was removed

555
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,000
from active government no one is pushing

556
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
anymore and federal chance the

557
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
chancellor of state of geneva uh anja

558
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,559
virgin galpa had quit as well so the

559
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
peop two people in geneva pushing his

560
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:43,600
quit

561
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,080
and then there was no energy behind it

562
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,559
anymore and the money ran out relatively

563
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,080
quickly and the rest of the government

564
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,480
was not interested to push this to throw

565
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,280
more money into it as a relatively small

566
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,600
swiss canton who thinks has a role to

567
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,919
play in this and is really important but

568
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,760
we cannot carry the burden for the whole

569
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,720
country so geneva quit not because of

570
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,200
newspaper headlines but because money

571
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,520
was running out and the support was

572
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,080
running out

573
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,559
good

574
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
what happened afterwards in early 2019

575
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,799
swiss post and cycle had to publish the

576
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,120
source code of their voting system so

577
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,880
under the formal legislation when you

578
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
wanted to do online voting at a given

579
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,360
moment you had to publish your source

580
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,919
code so you can develop everything in

581
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,520
your basement not showing anybody

582
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
anything and just stating that you're

583
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,919
secure trust us but at given moment you

584
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,840
have to publish your and then

585
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,919
people going to look at your source code

586
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,520
and this better be good

587
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,960
and that was supposed to happen in 2019

588
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,240
there were two parts of the program

589
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,080
publishing the source code

590
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,120
and having bug bounty hunters attack the

591
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,960
live system

592
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,120
the way this played out was the schedule

593
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,360
was crunched together so the two things

594
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
happen at the same moment

595
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,440
apparently source code cycle

596
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,520
live system production servers swiss

597
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,720
post

598
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,480
but the moment is crunched together

599
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
nobody could see the difference anymore

600
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,880
and what was actually happening it was a

601
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,960
total disaster here we got a few

602
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
headlines i love the one from the

603
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,720
registers they had this coming swiss

604
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
electronic voting system like wait for

605
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,200
it swiss cheese whole founder with

606
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,280
public source code audit

607
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,400
within four weeks three major

608
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
vulnerabilities had been found highly

609
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,000
critical vulnerabilities

610
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,559
number three was as bad system had to be

611
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,679
stopped

612
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,760
literal not quite immediately but it was

613
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,240
there was no way they could go to a

614
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,880
national election with that system this

615
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,039
the vulnerabilities have been so severe

616
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,200
you see two people here top left

617
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,520
vanessatique on twitter and sarah jamie

618
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,640
lewis they've proven to be extremely

619
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,120
important here

620
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
one thing that's important about the

621
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,559
eight they've been women very cool b

622
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
they're non-swiss

623
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,159
it's not swiss i.t security engineers

624
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,080
who stop the system it's been a

625
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,159
professor from australia and the freak

626
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,520
living in canada

627
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,280
we stopped the system

628
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,799
and that was very interesting there was

629
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,039
swiss university the one uh applied

630
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:18,559
sciences in bern played a major role

631
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,480
they discovered builderabilities as well

632
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,880
but not three of them in a row

633
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
so

634
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,320
what happened actually is that the

635
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,240
opposition in switzerland

636
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,400
said we're against e-voting but we're

637
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,480
not participating in this program we

638
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
hate this don't participate and that was

639
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,679
a big blunder because without vanessa

640
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:39,679
teague and sarah william sorry jamie

641
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,559
lewis

642
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,240
they might not have found these

643
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,159
vulnerabilities and we'd have run into a

644
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,640
federal election with that source code

645
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
so only because security experts

646
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,200
actually took the time and looked at

647
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,360
this for days and weeks of work without

648
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,799
being paid by the way

649
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,600
uh

650
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,679
the system could have gone in production

651
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,840
so that was huge risk

652
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,840
of the swiss opposition because the role

653
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,880
of the no eat voting crowd of course is

654
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,600
to pay attention what the pro e voting

655
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,919
count is doing what swiss poet is doing

656
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,080
has to be challenged and has to be

657
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
scrutinized and people have to look at

658
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,840
that and if the ccc in switzerland

659
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,440
refuses to do the job who's going to do

660
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,400
it

661
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,880
we were lucky somebody in australia

662
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,520
great job thank you

663
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,360
good so they had to stop that system

664
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,919
meantime the no e-voting crowd launched

665
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,760
a public referendum

666
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,400
for the non-swiss amongst you if you

667
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,480
want to make sure that

668
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,039
that a law is not

669
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,960
becoming officially if you want to stop

670
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,520
the law you can collect signatures 50

671
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,200
000 which is for switzerland it's

672
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,279
already a bit substantial 50 000 that's

673
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,039
not done on weekend

674
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,640
however if you want to make sure that

675
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,799
the law is not even prepared then you

676
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,039
need a hundred thousand signatures and

677
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,200
that is really substantial and they went

678
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,440
for that way they wanted to go to the

679
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,880
constitution

680
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,640
and have it written in the constitution

681
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,240
that no e-voting is allowed in

682
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,919
switzerland for several years down the

683
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,000
road whatever the details are and they

684
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,279
said we're going to do this and they

685
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
launched at the same moment so this buck

686
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
bounty hunt is running and they're

687
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
launching

688
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,120
their public referendum collection of

689
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,360
signatures

690
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,240
huge blunder i think that i mean that is

691
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,159
that is a decision what we're gonna do

692
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,600
are we going to attack the source code

693
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,720
and stop it and say because it's

694
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,440
 or are we

695
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
doing a gamble on getting signatures and

696
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,279
enforce the public vote and win the

697
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,159
public vote and it's not happening

698
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,640
and i think there was a huge strategic

699
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
error and

700
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
we were lucky it worked

701
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,360
however that was not known in march 2019

702
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,120
it was a great bright day in lucerne

703
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,640
when they started this i think it's a

704
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,200
very beautiful photo and i was

705
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,200
personally hoping they would succeed i

706
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,880
mean this was the path they decided to

707
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,960
go and i hope they would succeed because

708
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
i hope we would have a public vote and

709
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,360
then the wider democratic society can

710
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,520
decide whether we want this or no

711
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,279
because so far it's only only been

712
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,880
politicians

713
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,080
and

714
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,760
there are a few familiar faces namely

715
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,360
for german speakers among you one of

716
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,600
them has grown his hair can hardly be

717
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,559
recognized anymore

718
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,360
but i think it was a very positive start

719
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,159
and i say this in a very unironic way i

720
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,159
really think it was a positive start but

721
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,080
it didn't quite play out

722
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,919
why didn't it play out let's look how it

723
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
didn't play out this is the the list or

724
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,679
a graph about headlines in swiss

725
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,480
newspapers online magazines about online

726
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
voting in 2019 as you can see during

727
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,600
this buck bounty hunt source code

728
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,000
publication and the launch of the

729
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,480
initiatives the referendum

730
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,200
uh huge number of headlines and then it

731
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,080
died down the system was stopped in june

732
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,240
so a wee bit more a little bump in the

733
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,640
headlines in june and then it was dead

734
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,320
no news anymore because system stopped

735
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,720
there's no nothing to talk about

736
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,120
in public anymore because swiss post is

737
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,679
licking its wounds uh federal chancellor

738
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,799
is writing new papers new regulation

739
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,880
inviting scientists but nothing is in

740
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,039
the news anymore and if you collect

741
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,799
signatures it's very hard if nothing is

742
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,320
in the news anymore

743
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,159
because this is this is a driver the

744
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,200
scandals are driving your signatures

745
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,440
let's look how they fared with their

746
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,799
signatures this is a screenshot from we

747
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,120
collect we collect is

748
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,480
an important

749
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
democratic platform namely in german

750
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,559
speaking part of switzerland and

751
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,240
seventy eighty percent of swiss

752
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,159
population speaks german so they're

753
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,159
important and they

754
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,919
that's a platform very laundry

755
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,200
referendum

756
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,960
and then you see here in the center it's

757
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,279
now in german uh

758
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,720
3 300 signatures have been pledged

759
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,640
so people go to recollect and say i

760
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,279
promise to sign this give me the pdf so

761
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,480
i can sign because you have to sign on

762
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,159
paper

763
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,159
and then submit a paper so this is not a

764
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,240
counting of actual votes this is

765
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
accounting of promised votes

766
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,840
and of course there are going to be

767
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,679
additional votes outside the platform

768
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,760
but but the sea lots will be on the

769
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
platform the seals will promise in

770
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,840
public i'm going to promise my vote and

771
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
if it's 3 000 then you're 97 000 short

772
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,200
of 100 000

773
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,039
so and of course they publish the

774
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,960
numbers so you can write a little bot

775
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,279
that downloads the numbers

776
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
and then you do a graph that's what i

777
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,039
did

778
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,799
the uri is here i'm going to publish my

779
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,559
slides the uris and below you can have

780
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,039
the data set and then you can correlate

781
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,440
the data set how many votes have been

782
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
played or how many signatures have been

783
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
pledged against the newspaper articles

784
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,200
and you will see

785
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,000
that they immediately got to three and a

786
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,200
half thousand

787
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,880
that's their friends

788
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,480
that's this group

789
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,679
they they signed immediately of course

790
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,679
they do but what happens afterward

791
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,760
flatline

792
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
they were not able to transpose or

793
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,200
transport the headlines into signatures

794
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
because nobody cared it's a security

795
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
crowd their friends who signed us yes

796
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
this is really really bad we have to

797
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,840
stop this but everybody else would go

798
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,360
actually i think that would be cool to

799
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,559
vote at home

800
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,960
online and never have stamps at home so

801
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,200
why don't you yeah somebody will carry

802
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,120
take care of the security

803
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,640
peop if you run a purely security

804
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,320
discourse in switzerland the wider

805
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,080
audience doesn't care they're not

806
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
interested in that you have to make it

807
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,760
tangible and this initiatives fail that

808
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,200
completely i mean

809
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
i mean if you get the headlines like

810
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,399
this

811
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,080
international ones but the swiss ones

812
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,320
were no way better than this

813
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,399
uh then uh

814
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,760
and this doesn't give your signatures

815
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,279
then you can just as well give up

816
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,120
actually they did give up but only one

817
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,360
year afterwards i don't know how many

818
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
signatures they had

819
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
let's estimate 40 000. 60 000 short and

820
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
i've made pandemic didn't help but this

821
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,399
is not a pandemic problem

822
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,640
this is a campaign problem and you

823
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
cannot get signatures for a topic that

824
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,799
nobody cares it has to be emotional

825
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,559
somehow in switzerland that is a defect

826
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,720
of our system but that's the way it is

827
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,080
if it's not emotional if it's not

828
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,840
glaciers or cows

829
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,399
it's hard

830
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,480
cheese will qualify as well probably

831
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,559
good so the ebony system was put on hold

832
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,080
in 2019 in 2020 you see this here on the

833
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,960
right rebooting 2020 the federal

834
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,360
chancellery said let's start a new the

835
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
steering board say hey you guys have to

836
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,200
start over

837
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
and let's do this for real this time we

838
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,320
need to invite the security experts now

839
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,080
and this is what they did

840
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,240
so here we have a list of

841
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
participating scientists

842
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,880
that were invited to join a wider longer

843
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,799
discussion about online voting and this

844
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,279
is like a who's who of security in

845
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,000
switzerland you always also get two blue

846
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,399
names so olivier pereira and vanessa

847
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,000
teague when i satik we've seen her

848
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
tweets oliver pareder is not as active

849
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,480
on twitter but they're a team and many

850
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,159
other people have participated eric

851
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,720
dubois ritter koenig philip locker et

852
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,640
cetera from university of applied

853
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,880
sciences you have apfl of course you

854
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,600
have eth and many other as security

855
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
professors in switzerland you also have

856
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,480
industry people like two guys from scrt

857
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,399
as tappan's sdrt is the company running

858
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,320
this conference so their security expert

859
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,080
invited perfect chancellory because

860
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,360
they're so strong as industry leaders

861
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,440
you have general computer scientists so

862
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,120
computer

863
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,799
cryptographers voting expert computer

864
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,399
scientists and then a few political

865
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,559
scientists and i was moderating the

866
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:42,559
dialogue i was the guy running the

867
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,640
dialogue in service federal chancellor

868
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,480
so i poop up

869
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
hey i've been doing this i was working

870
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,080
for swiss post hey i was doing that

871
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
geneva used my web application firewall

872
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,679
rules hey i was part of that team as

873
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,919
well so

874
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,760
i'm popping all over the place with this

875
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,159
online voting stuff good

876
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,039
um

877
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,200
so in february 2020 and the people got

878
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,480
scientists got

879
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,720
a survey with like 60 questions

880
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,640
substantial sit down work on this for

881
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,039
several days because a lot of questions

882
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,039
and then we had this pandemic hit the

883
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:17,039
idea was let's do a survey and then we

884
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
identified key questions what did we

885
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,880
need to discuss in several workshops and

886
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,880
then we write a report it didn't work so

887
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,559
we had to do an online dialogue and we

888
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
run this on a gitlab platform this is

889
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,640
really cool federal chancellor would say

890
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,919
what we're going to do now we cannot do

891
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,240
workshops it's illegal i say yeah let's

892
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,480
try and do this online we're gonna do

893
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,880
we can do sharepoint or gitlab if you

894
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,919
decide to do this on sharepoint i'm out

895
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,240
but if if you're okay with gitlab it's

896
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,480
gonna work and it did it it worked

897
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
nicely

898
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:48,880
and then some additional research around

899
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,399
it and then a scientific report at the

900
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,360
end of 2011 this is the front page of of

901
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,240
the report here is the uri download the

902
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,159
slides afterwards if you haven't looked

903
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,559
at it and at least a wee bit interested

904
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,559
go and take a look read at least the

905
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,720
abstract this is really important and

906
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
it's very interesting and it's readable

907
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,880
by people like you and me

908
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,880
and especially cryptographers among you

909
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,080
but really it's not only for

910
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,240
cryptographers it's for a general

911
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,200
interest

912
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,960
audience with a certain technical

913
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,080
interest

914
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,399
and it has a significance outside

915
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:22,799
switzerland this is about online voting

916
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,399
in general this is not so much about

917
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,679
switzerland so in this report is read

918
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,519
internationally

919
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,960
because it is strong and it's very good

920
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,440
and it's important people are reading it

921
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,919
good based on that report there was then

922
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
a political report was almost the same

923
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,760
the political report was very close to

924
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,760
the scientific report and then in 2021

925
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,399
they wrote the draft regulation

926
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,960
based on this and then people were

927
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,240
invited in a public consultation period

928
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,799
to give feedback on the draft regulation

929
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,720
this is how it works in switzerland

930
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,880
always they drew a draft law and then

931
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
you were invited several organizations

932
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,480
political parties cantons of course are

933
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,360
invited but basically everybody can

934
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
give feedback and the cool thing about

935
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,120
that system is you will end up in the

936
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,559
final report they will quote you in the

937
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,279
final report say look mr felini said the

938
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
following about our proposal

939
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,799
and they will say yeah that's important

940
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,200
or not so important but everybody gets

941
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,159
to have a say which i think is kind of

942
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:25,360
cool

943
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,720
it's of course it's a lot of work to

944
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,200
participate in here but i teamed up with

945
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,440
a couple of friends and we did a

946
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,919
response as well so we joined in and

947
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,559
submitted our response to this new draft

948
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,279
regulation i'm coming to that now but oh

949
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,760
i skipped the weeby part let's look back

950
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,600
at this scientific report november

951
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,600
2020

952
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,440
a few key recommendations report is like

953
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,799
60 80 pages long and i picked out a few

954
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,120
important bits there's of course a ton

955
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,440
of advice on cryptography

956
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,880
has to be

957
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,039
problem cryptography is

958
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,200
and if you do a little of online boating

959
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,279
is i said this is like two magnets the

960
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,079
secret of the ballot and to prove that

961
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,399
nothing has been manipulated

962
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,040
and you could solve the problem by

963
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,480
publishing everything

964
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,079
and then everybody can do the proofs at

965
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,520
home

966
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,320
do run the programs checking all the

967
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,000
mathematical proofs

968
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,040
however

969
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
if we envision quantum computing 10

970
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,480
years down the road

971
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,480
if you publish everything there is a

972
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,480
certain chance and we don't really know

973
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,280
but it's a risk that somebody could

974
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,000
take the archive of that data

975
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:36,800
and

976
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,199
break the secrecy of the vote with a

977
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,280
quantum computer it's not possible today

978
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,440
but maybe it's possible 10 years down

979
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,079
the road so you cannot publish all the

980
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,560
data so everybody can check this

981
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,000
themselves this is called a public

982
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,239
builder board you cannot do this because

983
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,679
you run to risk to break the

984
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,760
the secrecy of the ballot several years

985
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,200
down the road so you cannot do this so

986
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,760
you have to have a certain

987
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,560
way of keeping it a bit secret but make

988
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
it widely known people can still check

989
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,880
that is hard that's why online voting is

990
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,320
so difficult what are you going to do

991
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,240
how do you address that problem

992
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,800
and a ton of advice on that problem was

993
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
done in that report there was also a

994
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,640
very strong call for diversity in

995
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,040
hardened software what does that mean

996
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,280
that means you have to run this on

997
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,960
several computers in parallel and it

998
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
better be different software different

999
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
operating system different hardware and

1000
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,640
the computers have to check each other

1001
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,119
meaning as person attacking it has to

1002
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,040
attack a windows

1003
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
linux and maybe an open bsc computer in

1004
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,359
parallel and several ssl stacks and

1005
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,040
several implementations and several

1006
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,839
everything makes it much more expensive

1007
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,160
building the system but also makes much

1008
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,240
more expensive attacking the system

1009
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,160
that's the theory behind this and there

1010
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,720
is a call a strong call for diversity

1011
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,560
and heart and software

1012
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,920
and swiss post the only remaining player

1013
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,680
kind of accepted that

1014
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,960
i mean somebody has to pay the bill at

1015
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,800
the end of the day but they're okay with

1016
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
this because it's obviously

1017
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
so

1018
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,240
strong and there was a very good case

1019
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,160
made for this diversity

1020
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,599
there was a call for a maximum level of

1021
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:14,320
transparency and a strong call for open

1022
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,079
source in scientific report the

1023
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,359
scientific report did not say

1024
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,680
it has to be open sorted and it is

1025
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,839
impossible without but it was a strong

1026
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:27,359
advice the scientific community would

1027
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,160
say

1028
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,640
it is hard to imagine

1029
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,920
a community building up if it's not open

1030
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,960
source

1031
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,280
if you publish just the code and tell

1032
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
people look look at it but you cannot

1033
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,119
use it there's not going to be a

1034
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,800
community around it's unlikely to

1035
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,040
develop a community around so we will

1036
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,880
have to pay people and foster the

1037
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,800
community but as if it's open source

1038
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,480
then it can be organic then people can

1039
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,119
reuse it forever they want and then

1040
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,280
maybe this starts to live so that was

1041
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,960
the advice in there

1042
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
and this is something swiss post fought

1043
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,720
with teeth and nail they they didn't

1044
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,480
want to have that they want to have

1045
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,560
complete liberty if we have to publish

1046
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,440
so be it but we're not making it open

1047
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
source

1048
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,960
very strong against this and then cross

1049
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,640
10 possibility checks in a scientific

1050
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,560
report the cross-channel plausibility

1051
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,560
checks were not as strong but i

1052
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
personally think this is really

1053
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,400
important what does it mean

1054
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,960
it means when you have mail-in ballots

1055
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
and you have electronic ballots

1056
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,040
you compare the results it's not going

1057
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,800
to be the same results it's not the same

1058
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,280
people doing the boat but similar

1059
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
patterns between cantons between

1060
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
municipalities and then if something

1061
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,320
sticks out and say hey look you we have

1062
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,720
a huge difference in electronic votes

1063
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,640
but not the same difference in male

1064
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,680
imbalance that's odd that's funny from a

1065
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,240
statistical perspective this is highly

1066
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,119
highly unlikely let's take a look this

1067
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,880
it was cross-channel possibility check

1068
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,839
could bring point is that's not existing

1069
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,680
the scientific

1070
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,480
the statistical science is not developed

1071
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,720
to do this so far nobody has done this

1072
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,680
so far this has to be researched

1073
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,760
papers have to be published about this

1074
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,119
and i hope this is going to happen

1075
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,359
because that would secure the two

1076
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:13,359
channels would secure each other which

1077
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,040
which is brilliant i mean weakness of

1078
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,960
the mailing ballots compensated by

1079
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,960
electronic votes very cool and the other

1080
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,160
way around so i think this is important

1081
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,320
in the report it's not as highlighted as

1082
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
i do here good

1083
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,839
okay indigenous

1084
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,839
report published public consultation

1085
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,280
now let's look at the public

1086
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,560
consultation

1087
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,920
new law new law published

1088
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,240
this new law is on a level where it's

1089
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,280
not going to parliament for whatever

1090
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,800
reasons in switzerland that's the way it

1091
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,040
works it's a federal chancery can that

1092
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,440
can make this law official but they

1093
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,359
still run a public consultation period

1094
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,440
and you can say you hate it and then

1095
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,760
they agree with you or they don't that's

1096
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,359
how this works

1097
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:58,240
and

1098
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,720
i'm not going to look at the individual

1099
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,520
regulations so much let's say it's a

1100
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,920
better regulation that allows for test

1101
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,240
trials for test runs strongly

1102
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,800
constrained test runs and you have swiss

1103
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
post has to do a lot of work

1104
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,440
to conform to the new regulation it's a

1105
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,040
tough job and it costs a lot of money

1106
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,040
and a lot of development resources

1107
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,440
but it's in no way let's introduce this

1108
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,640
to everybody

1109
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,520
it's so restricted it's hard to do and

1110
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,640
it will be test runs for many many years

1111
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,640
so the 2017 call let's do online voting

1112
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
oh that this is gone this is gone it's

1113
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,599
now security over speed again as it has

1114
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,599
been for 20 years so i would say there

1115
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,280
was an exception to call everybody and

1116
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,359
it was a bit of a blunder didn't work so

1117
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,920
well so we're back to swiss

1118
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,960
security over speed and that that's okay

1119
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,880
so i teamed up with a couple of friends

1120
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,920
and we did a response as the many others

1121
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,000
and i'm going to look now who is

1122
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,119
responding how are they responding and

1123
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,040
what are they not so much what they are

1124
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,320
saying

1125
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,560
but who because that is important

1126
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:07,920
if we're going to do online as a society

1127
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,760
we have to have a knowledge level to

1128
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,160
talk about this we need public scrutiny

1129
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,720
we need enough experts to look at this

1130
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,200
and enough people interested in it and

1131
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,520
enough cantons knowing what they're

1132
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,359
actually doing there because if you

1133
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:22,880
imagine

1134
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,640
i'm not naming any swiss mountain

1135
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,079
cantons but if you uh imagine them doing

1136
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,240
bleeding edge cryptography

1137
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,720
hard hard to imagine because that that

1138
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,640
is tough that's real stuff so are the

1139
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,079
captains in a in a position to do this

1140
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,680
you could see in this public

1141
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,760
consultation let's look at the responses

1142
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,599
is this a qualified response or is just

1143
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,720
blah blah is it or is it

1144
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,200
hard evidence let's look at this

1145
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,800
so 67 responses almost 700 pages of

1146
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,960
respect that's a lot of text

1147
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,640
a lot of people have been sitting down

1148
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,280
and writing qualified responses this is

1149
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,640
good feedback

1150
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,920
at least in a quantitative way

1151
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,680
so who has responded um

1152
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,200
my work here is now based on the report

1153
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,119
they published so they would take to 700

1154
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,240
pages and then weed it out and chew it

1155
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,839
and write

1156
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,839
a response report federal chancellor

1157
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,119
always does response respondents they

1158
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,000
say look we got 67 responses from

1159
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,760
so-and-so many organization and this is

1160
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,480
what they did and then on paragraph 14

1161
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,560
we got the following responses and we

1162
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,640
conclude the following and now up to

1163
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,359
article number 15. this is boring report

1164
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,440
of course but it's also very interesting

1165
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,280
report and it's a good source for my

1166
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,640
presentation

1167
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,359
because we've got 67 responses 48 fm

1168
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,359
positive 11 have been positive with

1169
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,280
fundamental reservations and 8 have been

1170
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,240
negative so it seems that no e-voting

1171
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,920
crowd is not as vocal as the

1172
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,640
pro-e-voting quantity so as it seems the

1173
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,560
cantons are generally in favor of

1174
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,160
e-voting they just no longer want to be

1175
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,760
the first ones trying it out but yeah

1176
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,040
it's actually good but let's have the

1177
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,880
other kind to go first

1178
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,480
and if they get burned

1179
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,160
we're out

1180
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,720
so it's been mostly positive a few

1181
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,040
really negative ones and

1182
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,240
you could say federal chance really

1183
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,319
likes this that's why they think

1184
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,160
everything is positive but i checked

1185
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,839
this it's actually true most people

1186
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,160
think yeah it's kind of okay but pay

1187
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,119
attention to the following points

1188
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:24,720
missing this course is very interesting

1189
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,040
who's missing who's not responding here

1190
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,280
so 67 you have all the cantons invited

1191
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,800
all the political parties invited and

1192
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,400
then lots and lots of organizations and

1193
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,640
of course all the it organizations would

1194
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,680
have been invited because they should

1195
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,440
they're supposed to be the experts so

1196
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:40,480
who's not responding you have to er if

1197
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,800
i'll pay the swiss protestant people's

1198
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:44,640
party is small to his party and i

1199
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,240
wouldn't expect them to respond it's a

1200
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,760
small party they have limited resources

1201
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,680
and they're not experts in online voting

1202
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:52,480
but then the green liberal party hey

1203
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,000
that's the digitalization party in

1204
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,319
switzerland and they didn't respond why

1205
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:59,280
didn't they respond because they're torn

1206
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,960
they hate this but at the same time they

1207
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,720
love it as well

1208
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,800
and they clash like this internally

1209
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,280
they're torn apart by these questions

1210
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,280
a lot of it people vote green liberal

1211
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,839
party and a lot of them will say hey

1212
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,520
digitalization let's do online voting

1213
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,280
and the other guys say oh no this is

1214
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,160
really

1215
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,680
really really dangerous don't do this

1216
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,160
and they couldn't come together to

1217
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,800
respond in a unified way

1218
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,200
this is significant i think and then ice

1219
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,920
city swiss icely is the biggest i.t

1220
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,520
association in switzerland they claim

1221
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,160
200 000 members there are no position to

1222
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,079
respond on the question

1223
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,000
of online voting very significant so

1224
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:36,880
either

1225
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,560
it's so hard

1226
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,200
oh this is a weak organization

1227
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
you choose

1228
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,640
i triple s that's the security

1229
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,800
association in switzerland i triple s

1230
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,720
did not respond that's a security

1231
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:51,200
industry in switzerland no response

1232
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,920
in no position or no resources are not

1233
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,240
interested or torn or whatever no

1234
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,000
response interesting because if they are

1235
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,200
not responding i mean who's going to

1236
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,240
respond

1237
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,960
and then ccc swiss branch so the guys

1238
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,680
are very vocal against e-voting the

1239
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,599
moment they're asked now put it on the

1240
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:09,200
table what you like don't like this is

1241
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,800
the new regulation now look at it and

1242
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,240
tell us what is bad

1243
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,760
no response

1244
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,480
newspapers media yeah yeah yeah once you

1245
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,720
ask them no response i think this is

1246
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,319
really weak

1247
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,680
good

1248
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,119
now

1249
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,040
you have the law

1250
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,119
you have a lower level law and then you

1251
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:29,119
have a technical annex

1252
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,280
that that is the really really boring

1253
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,079
stuff

1254
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,760
and it's been very extensive the

1255
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,079
technical analysis i think is it 40

1256
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,119
pages i think that's a lot of details in

1257
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,119
there and that's rough stuff and there's

1258
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,720
also a bit of crazy stuff now give you

1259
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,680
an example go-to statements are illegal

1260
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,040
in online voting in switzerland and you

1261
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,040
say yeah but golden state are hard and

1262
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,280
they're not so smart but maybe there is

1263
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,040
a role for go-to statements in the

1264
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
online voting system i don't know

1265
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,319
the regulation would say the technical

1266
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:57,839
annex to the regulations say they are

1267
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,200
illegal you're not allowed to do them

1268
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,119
they're good okay now let's write a

1269
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:02,960
system without go to statements

1270
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,280
probably possible

1271
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,839
but i think it's going down now very

1272
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:09,680
very deep telling developers what to do

1273
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,079
on a law level some regulation level

1274
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,640
okay that's hard so the technical annex

1275
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,560
is where you really need to know how and

1276
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,000
a lot of time to look at it so who

1277
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,280
responded here

1278
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,359
we got 24 responses

1279
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,520
overall 67 technical annex 24 yeah

1280
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,359
you get why because this is not really

1281
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,280
boring and then six of them have been

1282
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,160
really minimal so uh canton appencel in

1283
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,440
the rodent that's one of the mountain

1284
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,000
cantons they responded minimal way the

1285
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,720
pirate party minimal way and

1286
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,560
geneva unfortunately also minimal but

1287
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,880
then 18 substantial responses on the

1288
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,480
tactical annex and look this is all

1289
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,680
cantons

1290
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,440
so you have more half of the swiss

1291
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,839
cantons responded to the technical annex

1292
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:51,680
in a substantial way i think this is

1293
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,480
great

1294
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,839
and if you look at these responses they

1295
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:55,760
are substantial they they know more or

1296
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,280
less what they're talking about they've

1297
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:58,400
been looking at this they've been

1298
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,560
building up know-how for years and years

1299
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,160
and now they're discussion partners

1300
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,319
federal chancery can talk to the cantons

1301
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,839
and they will find

1302
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:07,440
communication partners who know about

1303
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,160
e-voting right now this is a very good

1304
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:12,160
image a very good response i think and

1305
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,560
then who else so the burn university of

1306
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,880
applied scientists bfh the blind

1307
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,800
people's association as before swiss

1308
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,920
post the the chancellors of the cantons

1309
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,800
ssk and then an individual plus my

1310
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,040
friends and me and we really struggled

1311
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,119
sized my friends and me and we struggled

1312
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,800
with the technical annex because it's so

1313
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,240
much work and it's been only the four of

1314
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,800
us and three of us have families and

1315
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,280
that was tough but we barely made it to

1316
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,640
re deposit something we thought yeah

1317
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,800
we don't have to be ashamed too much

1318
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:43,599
that

1319
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,720
missing political parties no political

1320
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,440
party responded technical annex

1321
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,280
i think this is highly problematic if no

1322
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,000
political party is in a position to

1323
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,839
respond on a technical discussion on

1324
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,359
e-voting

1325
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:58,880
difficult to have a democracy because

1326
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,640
they need these experts i mean it's

1327
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,560
going to go into the parliament sooner

1328
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,920
or later and the parliament is going to

1329
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,400
decide to a certain extent and if all

1330
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,640
the politicians don't have an opinion on

1331
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,160
that and nobody feeding them with an

1332
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,520
opinion

1333
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:12,640
hard

1334
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,480
the swiss academy of the technical

1335
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,079
sciences did not respond to the

1336
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:18,160
technical analytics if the swiss academy

1337
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,599
of the technical sciences is not in a

1338
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,440
position to respond that is a very bad

1339
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,520
sign even more as there has been a

1340
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,440
scientific report they could base their

1341
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,920
response on it and just copy paste it

1342
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,280
no didn't

1343
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:31,520
digital switzerland suico djs these are

1344
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,760
smaller organizations

1345
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,359
with i.t people

1346
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,640
good

1347
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,800
now let's look at one topic

1348
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,559
call for open source so the scientific

1349
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,480
report said strong advice for open

1350
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,880
source new relation no open source new

1351
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,520
regulation says you have to publish the

1352
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:48,880
source code

1353
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:52,240
and then 11 organizations responded hey

1354
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,800
hold on that's not enough we want open

1355
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,119
source in the law it has got to be open

1356
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,000
source

1357
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,280
11 did

1358
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,000
and funny funny enough two of them

1359
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,559
digital switzerland and economy swiss

1360
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,960
responded we love the way you regulate

1361
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,400
for open source

1362
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,680
and that means they didn't understand

1363
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:11,680
what opens in speed economy swiss does

1364
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,440
not understand the term

1365
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,440
open source i think this is pretty

1366
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,520
embarrassing actually because there is

1367
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,760
no open source regulation in here but

1368
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:21,760
they still welcome open source which is

1369
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,680
kind of cool

1370
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,520
but they don't understand the term

1371
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,800
because open source of course about the

1372
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:28,720
license it's not about publishing source

1373
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,800
code it's about the license being

1374
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,880
allowed to do things after this is what

1375
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,960
brings community not

1376
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,720
publishing source codes and then don't

1377
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,920
touch it because it's going to be

1378
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,640
illegal and you go we sue you if you

1379
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,079
reuse this

1380
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,200
it's about the license good

1381
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,599
this call has been heard

1382
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,839
in the media release

1383
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:52,000
together with the official report about

1384
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,839
the public consultation the federal

1385
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:56,079
chancellor would say

1386
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:58,079
basically we have heard the call for

1387
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,839
open source and we're going to address

1388
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,559
this down the lane why not immediately

1389
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,400
and this is not the final regulation

1390
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
final regulation coming out in summer

1391
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,599
but i'm pretty confident there will be

1392
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,839
no open source in the final regulation

1393
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,160
because swiss post has lobbied strongly

1394
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,480
against it because they think it's not

1395
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,880
possible for us at least not right now

1396
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,640
it's going to cost us a lot of money and

1397
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:20,640
we already have a lot on our table

1398
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,800
already and this is hard and they even

1399
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,960
threatened to quit

1400
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,280
online voting if they're imposed an

1401
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,920
online voting i have an open source

1402
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,440
license so this is the primarily defense

1403
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,160
battle of swiss post has been we don't

1404
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,000
want an open source license on our

1405
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,599
system it's our system by the way don't

1406
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,319
take it away from us

1407
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,200
however the federal chancellor says open

1408
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,599
source is going to be addressed sooner

1409
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,079
or later this is only a stalemate for

1410
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,920
now

1411
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,680
i think this can be i mean the moment

1412
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,040
the federal chance really publishes

1413
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,480
something we're going to address this

1414
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,559
they cannot move back anymore

1415
00:49:58,559 --> 00:49:59,680
so this

1416
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,280
sooner or later we're gonna see this

1417
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,400
regulation

1418
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,480
and i think this is as strong as it

1419
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,720
could get at the moment because if this

1420
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,079
post threatens to quit then

1421
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:11,920
the last system is dying and there is

1422
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,440
going to be no e-voting nobody wants

1423
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,240
that

1424
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,760
the pro-e-voting people of course want

1425
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,000
this to continue so the threat is

1426
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,559
immediate so they would

1427
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,200
not regulate it but the pressure is

1428
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,720
there good i'm coming to the end of my

1429
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,400
presentation

1430
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,400
public consultation is over the report

1431
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,319
has been published we're going to see

1432
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:34,000
the new regulation

1433
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,079
towards summer perhaps

1434
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,079
and then there will be new e-voting

1435
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:40,800
trials limited trials in switzerland

1436
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,839
probably done by small swiss cantons or

1437
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,559
smaller smallish swiss cantons and the

1438
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,240
only ones announced that are going to do

1439
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,480
this if i'm not mistaken is the canton

1440
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,559
of torgau and sengo

1441
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:54,240
they are leading the torch right now the

1442
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,319
torch has been giving from geneva

1443
00:50:56,319 --> 00:50:58,240
maybe to freeborg and they have given it

1444
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,880
to now the sengal and torgobi and they

1445
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,119
want online but they still won despite

1446
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:05,040
all the hassles

1447
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,200
despite all the problems they still want

1448
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,280
to do this and

1449
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,640
they're probably going to do this in the

1450
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:12,400
federal election next year and if that

1451
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,319
succeeds then we'll see

1452
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:17,520
probably a small spread of online voting

1453
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,160
and that is the first prediction i'm

1454
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,000
going to make so i'm now coming to the

1455
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,400
final part but i make a fool of myself

1456
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,520
so um

1457
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,440
wrapped is into my skin when it's not

1458
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:28,880
true

1459
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,880
i'm sure the plot twist will go in

1460
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,400
different directions but right now this

1461
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,640
is how the situation looks for me

1462
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,119
so we see a a slow expansion of e-voting

1463
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,160
after the national election of 2023

1464
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,240
unless it doesn't happen it's going to

1465
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,079
be bound by individual

1466
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,480
people actually people pushing this

1467
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
somebody in a canton saying we want to

1468
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,240
do this because the canton has the

1469
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,480
authority and somebody going to the

1470
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,160
local parliament saying we want to do

1471
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:56,400
this give us the money parliament so we

1472
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,040
can implement this and this is happening

1473
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,280
in cantons where such a person can be

1474
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,559
found

1475
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,040
usually this the chancellor of that

1476
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,559
camper

1477
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,079
who wants to do that

1478
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,400
so we'll see a slow expansion

1479
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,880
unless something happens

1480
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,559
the e-voting system of swiss post will

1481
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,800
become open source i predict five years

1482
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,079
down the road it's going to be open

1483
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:19,839
source because the pressure is so big

1484
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,160
and they know it's annoying and they get

1485
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:23,760
the same questions all the time and of

1486
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,200
course they hate it

1487
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,000
and i think there is a movement towards

1488
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,680
open source i think eventually we'll be

1489
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:30,480
there

1490
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,839
but let's keep up the pressure

1491
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:34,880
good

1492
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:37,040
i'm sure i'm pretty sure a disability

1493
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,200
organization will sue for e-voting

1494
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,920
because they don't get the secret ballot

1495
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,839
on a constitutional level that is a

1496
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,359
problem and i think they're a pretty

1497
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,240
good situation to sue how could they sue

1498
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,359
you have a tight vote 50 50

1499
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:53,440
probably something that really addresses

1500
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,960
needs of disabled people and they would

1501
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,440
go hey we have sown so many thousand

1502
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,200
people who couldn't vote because they

1503
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,720
wanted to have the secret ballot the

1504
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,800
secret ballot couldn't be guaranteed so

1505
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,559
they have been free disfranchised from

1506
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,440
the vote and the vote result is invalid

1507
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,839
you have to redo the vote with

1508
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,839
taking in the handicapped people i think

1509
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:13,040
they're in pretty good position to do

1510
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,480
this sooner or later

1511
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,200
and inclusion handicap has sued swiss

1512
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,920
trains cff have been sued and they lost

1513
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,680
in the federal court a couple of weeks

1514
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,920
ago so these organizations are getting

1515
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,319
stronger and they dare to sue

1516
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:28,319
switzerland over their rights for

1517
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:30,720
handicapped people so i think

1518
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,559
one of these organizations going to sue

1519
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:35,440
and the response to that

1520
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,359
is hard to find beyond the voting it's

1521
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:40,640
hard to let a blind person vote

1522
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:42,960
in a secret way without e-voting because

1523
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,960
you can do a brill a bribe ballot and

1524
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,319
they can fill out the buy ballot but

1525
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,480
nobody's able to count it anymore

1526
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,559
that is just a problem here they can

1527
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,559
vote but nobody can count the vote

1528
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:54,400
afterwards because the vote encounters

1529
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,559
like me we don't read pride

1530
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,559
that is the handicap here and online

1531
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,079
voting addresses that need and it's very

1532
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,400
hard to address otherwise especially for

1533
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,559
elections where we have lists of 20

1534
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,480
people

1535
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,839
online voting addresses that need and i

1536
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,280
think they're going to sue

1537
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,680
and i'm confident they might win and

1538
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,960
then what you're going to do we'll have

1539
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,800
to introduce online voting better be

1540
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,240
secure by then

1541
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,079
good cross-channel possibility checks

1542
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:19,520
will improve security for all voting

1543
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,119
channels i explain this why i think it's

1544
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,200
important i think it will happen and if

1545
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,280
we get online voting we'll also get the

1546
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,359
signs to support this and then we do

1547
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,440
this and voting will become more secure

1548
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,280
because of this

1549
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,880
the mailing balance will become more

1550
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,960
secure because they're statistically

1551
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,079
secured against the other general and

1552
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,240
finally we're going to see

1553
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,480
in the midterm a severe security problem

1554
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,839
in a public vote of course we're going

1555
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,640
to be society systems

1556
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:49,040
and there is going to be a problem and

1557
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:52,160
it's probably happening during a vote

1558
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,799
the most likely is somebody pushes a

1559
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,040
vulnerability in the code while the vote

1560
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,319
is running

1561
00:54:58,319 --> 00:54:59,359
meaning

1562
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,440
we have a running vote we know there is

1563
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,160
a bug but we cannot fix it because the

1564
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:07,200
vote is running and we get the results

1565
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,440
and i pray the results will not be 50

1566
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,799
50.

1567
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:12,880
because the publication of a bug

1568
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,280
will of course have an impact on the

1569
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,960
voting of the people

1570
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,200
and if that happens we're in a severe

1571
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,440
problem if we have a security problem in

1572
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,920
the code published during a vote and

1573
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,160
then we have a 50 against 50 votes very

1574
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,799
tight result couple of thousand votes

1575
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:31,359
then as a society we will test our

1576
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:33,359
ability to trust

1577
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,520
online voting thank you for attention

1578
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,829
[Music]

1579
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:47,599
thank you for the

1580
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,559
other questions here

1581
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,179
[Music]

1582
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,040
thanks christian for this uh super

1583
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,599
interesting talk i have a question about

1584
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,119
um the

1585
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:09,599
the business development of swiss post

1586
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:10,480
so

1587
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,559
as we've seen they they're about to

1588
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:14,559
invest or they are already investing a

1589
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,280
lot of resources and money into this

1590
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,880
system

1591
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,760
but we only have 24 cantons so

1592
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,680
do you know if they have any plans to

1593
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,319
to sell the system also internationally

1594
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,319
i don't know of any plans to sell the

1595
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:34,160
system internationally

1596
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:36,480
you could think of that the

1597
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,400
one problem with that is

1598
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,240
online voting

1599
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:42,319
is very strongly tied

1600
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:44,400
to the i would say the political culture

1601
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,240
of a country

1602
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,160
and different countries have different

1603
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,200
needs and that goes down actually to the

1604
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,920
cryptography protocol level

1605
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,520
give you an example

1606
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,960
voting coercion is no problem no except

1607
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,559
the problem switzerland

1608
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,960
we know that a husband can take his gun

1609
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,440
and point point it at his wife to have

1610
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,040
her vote something

1611
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,119
that might be happening in this country

1612
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,280
but we kind of accept it

1613
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,280
however in different country for example

1614
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,040
in estonia that is a real real issue

1615
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,720
their voting protocol their online

1616
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,760
voting

1617
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:22,400
specification the crypto field proofs

1618
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,880
are developed in a way to fight that

1619
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,920
problem the swiss voting system is not

1620
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,160
so you could not take the swiss voting

1621
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,400
silver swiss post export it to estonia

1622
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,799
it's not possible because in estonia you

1623
00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,040
can override your decision you can

1624
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,960
return to it and when the husband is

1625
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,839
asleep you say no actually i'm for that

1626
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:42,880
candidate

1627
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,559
that works in estonia that's not working

1628
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,880
in switzerland the moment you say submit

1629
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:49,520
it's submitted so on the

1630
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,079
cryptographic level you have different

1631
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:53,920
implementation that is tied to the

1632
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,000
political culture because we we think

1633
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,400
we're nice people and we're not pin

1634
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,319
gun pointing somebody to vote on

1635
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,480
something that makes it really hard to

1636
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,680
export it

1637
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,160
maybe many many years down the road when

1638
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:08,720
this is generalized the problem is

1639
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:11,280
abstracted away then it becomes a config

1640
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:12,240
item

1641
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,000
but as far as i understand it we're in

1642
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,799
no position to do this and

1643
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:18,240
i mean i'm no longer working for swiss

1644
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,839
pose but

1645
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:22,720
i think we would see this

1646
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:24,720
trying to address a wider audience

1647
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,880
outside system and i don't see anything

1648
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,799
from outside and i would personally be

1649
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:29,839
surprised

1650
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,319
it's hard

1651
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,640
thanks christian um i'm happy that

1652
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,799
you're also an historian so i i have the

1653
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:40,319
feeling it's the first time i understood

1654
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,000
the history of e-voting

1655
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,400
i would like to challenge you on a more

1656
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,799
maybe abstract level

1657
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,119
if you look at the four advantages that

1658
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,880
you laid out for it

1659
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,440
do you really think it's worth it

1660
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,599
we live in switzerland we have a

1661
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,640
a very mature ladder-based voting system

1662
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,280
and it has disadvantages given that

1663
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,559
however

1664
00:59:04,559 --> 00:59:06,880
the whole risk and the money and the

1665
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,040
time and the investment also of your

1666
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,520
time and so on all your friends

1667
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,160
i lean towards the feeling this is a

1668
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,880
first level problem in a state

1669
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,599
that doesn't really need to care

1670
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:21,359
that much about

1671
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,079
making a super efficient system even

1672
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:25,760
more efficient i mean we are not in the

1673
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:26,960
states

1674
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,880
if you looked at the ballot problems

1675
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,319
there i would super easily argue for

1676
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,680
e-voting

1677
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,520
but in switzerland do you really think

1678
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,240
it's worth it

1679
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,559
i don't know

1680
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,599
okay i can tell you the following

1681
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:45,599
if i was hoping they succeed with their

1682
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,119
referendum and then we're going to vote

1683
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,160
for it if we're voting next weekend

1684
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,920
for or against e-voting i don't know

1685
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,760
what i'm going to vote because i'm

1686
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,640
extremely torn because of these reasons

1687
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,640
i think there are very good reasons

1688
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,440
against it but i also think the four

1689
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,440
reasons and for me this arctic four core

1690
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,680
reasons they're strong i mean

1691
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,440
if we have a constitution and the

1692
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,799
current institution says you get a

1693
01:00:08,799 --> 01:00:10,640
secret ballot and then somebody does not

1694
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,400
get the secret ballot then you have a

1695
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:13,760
breach in the constitution and it

1696
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,440
doesn't matter if it's one person or

1697
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:17,599
it's a hundred thousand person

1698
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,280
if you have a breach in the constitution

1699
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,040
then we need to find a solution and the

1700
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,359
only viable solution i see

1701
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:26,240
is unfortunately online voting now is it

1702
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,520
worth it is it risky

1703
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,760
very hard to tell i think switzerland

1704
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,160
has to decide ultimately

1705
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:35,599
however

1706
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,839
we're in the development stage

1707
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,760
this better be secure

1708
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,920
and i think it is my role and our role

1709
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:42,799
here

1710
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:44,000
as a

1711
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,480
group and a society and as association

1712
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,400
and people interested is and this is our

1713
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,680
democracy

1714
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:50,799
we need to

1715
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:52,559
look very carefully what's happening

1716
01:00:52,559 --> 01:00:54,880
here we need to add companies we need to

1717
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,119
scrutinize we need to challenge them we

1718
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,680
need to keep up the pressure because the

1719
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,480
role as security engineers and security

1720
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,359
developers security people is to make

1721
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:06,559
sure

1722
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:09,119
that if we get this if switzerland as a

1723
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:11,359
country decides we want to have it it is

1724
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:14,640
the most secure possible

1725
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,640
because maybe it dies

1726
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,880
fair enough maybe it doesn't maybe we

1727
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:21,040
get this and then it's better be secure

1728
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,119
that's why i do this work

1729
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:24,480
in my spare time

1730
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,640
now final remark

1731
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,319
and then i'm closing this

1732
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:29,280
uh

1733
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,680
there are most cantons are slightly pro

1734
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,520
because they say advantages and they

1735
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,960
think this could work better this could

1736
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,319
provoke gonna be a nice project and it's

1737
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:39,200
giving money and whatever

1738
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,880
but there are a couple of cantons that

1739
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,000
go like hey we have a perfect system hey

1740
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,400
why touch that and a lot of

1741
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,880
no e-voting people say hey it's running

1742
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:50,960
smooth why would you want to touch this

1743
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,400
and i got this for

1744
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:54,079
four reasons already and

1745
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:56,160
reason number four is the

1746
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,559
security problems of the existing four

1747
01:01:58,559 --> 01:01:59,680
channel

1748
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,559
the mail in ballots they have inherent

1749
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,880
security problems they really do and now

1750
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,559
who's addressing these problems nobody's

1751
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:08,160
addressing these problems why the system

1752
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,240
is so nice it's so perfect

1753
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,599
however

1754
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:14,079
it is not and look at the cantons that

1755
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:16,079
think about that that's the evoding

1756
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:18,480
accountants the evo decantons are

1757
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,400
thinking about security of voting and

1758
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,920
the no e-voting accountants i give you

1759
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,559
the example of schweitz swiss mountain

1760
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:26,240
canton they respond to the public

1761
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,160
consultation what the why do you

1762
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:29,760
want to do this it's perfect no security

1763
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,799
problem whatsoever however if you look

1764
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,200
at how mailing ballots works how the

1765
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:36,400
whole

1766
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,960
process works around it

1767
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,760
you read the regis the voting register

1768
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,079
is of course electronic

1769
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,760
then they do an export

1770
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,079
they have an excel table they put this

1771
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:50,079
in an email send it to the print shop

1772
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,400
the print job is printing the ballots

1773
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,400
they're sent swiss posts all across the

1774
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:55,680
country

1775
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:57,200
and down the lane

1776
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,280
there's been a single paper looking at

1777
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,799
the security of this and the paper is

1778
01:03:00,799 --> 01:03:04,480
only two years old why because e-voting

1779
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,640
has raised the discourse people are now

1780
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:08,640
thinking about it hey we do online

1781
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,039
voting are there actually electronic

1782
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:13,839
system involved in voting in switzerland

1783
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,359
yes they're all over the place you're

1784
01:03:15,359 --> 01:03:18,160
not aware how much

1785
01:03:18,160 --> 01:03:20,400
electronic systems how much software

1786
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,400
black box system that is not publicly

1787
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,359
known is working on elections on sunday

1788
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:26,640
i'm going to

1789
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,880
count election votes in the canton of

1790
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,039
burn we have a cantona election and i'm

1791
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:33,760
going to type ballots into a black box

1792
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:35,839
computer that's going to count them i

1793
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:37,680
know this is happening but it

1794
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,280
there is a single newspaper article

1795
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,920
about these systems every swiss canton

1796
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,920
has such a system nobody knows about

1797
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,760
them their black box system that source

1798
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:47,359
code has never been published hasn't

1799
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:48,960
even been publicly scrutinized and

1800
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,200
they're going to vote they're counting

1801
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,119
the votes and the computer is going to

1802
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,680
say this party has sown so many votes

1803
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,480
and

1804
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,599
i think the e-voting discourse sheds

1805
01:03:59,599 --> 01:04:02,240
light on that discourse as well i'm not

1806
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,960
sure if we should do e-voting or not but

1807
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,039
i'm welcoming the discourse around the

1808
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,839
security vote for the society as a whole

1809
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:11,760
and if we have a trickle-down of better

1810
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,559
security on the mailing ballots then we

1811
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,559
have already won something even if we

1812
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,520
drop e-voting at the end we have pro

1813
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,680
improve the over posture

1814
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:23,039
of

1815
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,520
the trust in voting in switzerland and i

1816
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,280
think that's why it is important to work

1817
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,440
in it and if it's important enough to

1818
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,119
introduce it

1819
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,200
i'm really torn i don't know

1820
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:34,400
but thank you for the question i think
