2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,920
test is that

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,160
working perfect thanks guys everyone so

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,640
this was a little technical issue we

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,720
faced with the beamer so for the ones

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
who have a presentation with a mac i

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,800
would really take the time to test it

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
um

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,640
it was very interesting to have the talk

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,360
before the keynote um about the battery

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,960
on 42.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,120
i did not choose that but actually that

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,200
is deep thought that's the computer who

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,280
gave the answer to the universe life and

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,399
everything

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
so it's more a coincidence and i wanted

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,520
to talk about how we've built uh one of

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
the most secure media companies in the

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,800
world so this is a quite bold statement

20
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,879
but i still believe that's the case so

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,199
afterwards you can roast me if that's

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,000
the case or not so don't hesitate to ask

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
questions as much as you can

24
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,520
my name is andrea schneider i'm the

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,159
group cease of tx group so for all of

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,560
that in room who doesn't know tx group

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
are you from switzerland

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,320
yeah okay so tx coupe um tigscoop was

29
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,880
founded somewhere

30
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:23,439
1890 around it was the targets on tiger

31
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,479
so targets on tiger that in 1893 the

32
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
target sign tiger was founded and the

33
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,240
first uh

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
newspaper in zurich was printed

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
somewhere outside of zurich today it's

36
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,479
more as the zurich city center

37
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
and that's where we came from so it's a

38
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,560
media company a newspaper company

39
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,240
but it no longer is

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,960
so now i'm i'm yeah it's working

41
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,799
fantastic just need some time for the

42
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,040
for the wifey so today we are a

43
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,280
multi-brand company so most of the

44
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,079
newspaper in switzerland belong to our

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,280
group so

46
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,880
whatever you read

47
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
you most likely read something

48
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,439
from our brands but we have a lot of

49
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,520
other things so

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,199
there is up there you will you will see

51
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,000
that the smg for example so whether you

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,120
buy something on ricardo tutti if you go

53
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
to car for you if you look for a flat on

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,400
home gate

55
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,760
you will end up

56
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,200
at tx group

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,879
if you have

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,840
for example that new neon free app for

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,959
banking

60
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,879
it's more or less also part of us if you

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,200
look for a job it's jobs.ch is also part

62
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,720
of our group so we have an ecosystem of

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,239
many many brands many digital companies

64
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,080
if you make an appointment via doodle if

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,040
you watch tv with satu it's also

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,239
tx group

67
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,800
so it's no longer a media company still

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
we call it like that but

69
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,640
we are not so what i will talk about

70
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,280
are a couple of principles that we apply

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,319
to make

72
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
everything more secure the one is the

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,959
thanos principle not google enthus it's

74
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
thanos

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
for those who are not in marvel things i

76
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,720
will explain what this means

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
very important we love pictures

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,760
and then there is a grogo principle

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,599
it doesn't apply anywhere but we just

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
love grogu i we really love him

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,879
but we love the cloud

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,879
that's more important so we are a cloud

83
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
company and i will explain what that

84
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,720
meant for security and groot

85
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,440
so groot is also important

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,080
and the crucial thing if you go to the

87
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
cloud is we love code

88
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,200
everything has code today even you can

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,480
do

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,280
security policies as code so code is one

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
of the most important things that

92
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,799
changes everything

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,280
especially infrastructure is code it's a

94
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
fantastic thing

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,439
so let's start right away i know from

96
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,159
for those in the back it's super small

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,120
on the upper left side there is 2015 and

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,959
this is how the security stack looked

99
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,239
like in 2015.

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,879
even if i click there is nothing so you

101
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
could type in the easiest password you

102
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,000
could remember

103
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,920
even shorter than every other system in

104
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
the world it was accepted so there was

105
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,680
no security at all

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
there was no real security

107
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,079
organization

108
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,400
but the company applied the thanos

109
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
principle

110
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,919
so thanos is the one the evil guy

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,800
snipping with his infinity stone things

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
and removed half of the universe's

113
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,400
population

114
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,800
to solve most of the problems

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,479
our company did the same not with the

116
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,320
security in mind

117
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
but we went to the g suite instead of

118
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
microsoft so we abandoned microsoft

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,040
office

120
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
and with that we got rid of 50 of all

121
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,680
security problems we had even if we

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,120
didn't know that we have them at that

123
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,000
time

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,720
so

125
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,440
um there was a bold move

126
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,479
and it helps us today as well so

127
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
and it makes it off very hard for pen

128
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
testers

129
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
to for example do fishing because just

130
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
not working like that it's often very

131
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
difficult so the thanos principle can be

132
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,720
applied also to other things like do you

133
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,479
want to use the adobe reader or

134
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,320
something else

135
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,160
you can look which technologies are

136
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
attacked most often and just choose an

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
alternative

138
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,160
sorry microsoft even if you do good

139
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,199
products

140
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,360
it helped us a lot

141
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
well that's it from 2015. let's move on

142
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,360
to 2016.

143
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,320
um even without security and 50 less of

144
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,680
the problems

145
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,520
well it was just a matter of time that

146
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,600
something would happen so this was a

147
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
famous incident at 20 minutes

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
that kick-started security and

149
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,080
kick-started more or less my career at

150
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
tx group

151
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,560
so

152
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,120
this was a time of advertisement so

153
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
malware was distributed

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,320
for everyone who visited 20 minutes.ch

155
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,639
and we reach about 80 of the swiss

156
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,319
population per week

157
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,560
even if i know that no one would say i

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,360
would ever read 20 minutes 80 will do

159
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,880
that

160
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,919
and then they removed the advertisement

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,680
and then they appeared up again so i was

162
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,199
in another company and we were blocking

163
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,680
20 minutes so this was a huge damage and

164
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,199
the management was like running in

165
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,199
circles oh my god

166
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,039
please solve that issue

167
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
best in one week or two weeks and then

168
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,120
let's forget about it and as everyone

169
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,880
knows that's not working

170
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,919
so

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,680
but it's more or less kick-starting

172
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
security it was fantastic because our

173
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
management had to learn

174
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,479
no

175
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,120
there is no way you can solve such an

176
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
issue if you can type one through two

177
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,000
three four five six as a password and

178
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,160
have no security at all so there has

179
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
been done a big audit um they found out

180
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,280
terrible things like you can imagine

181
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,080
and they followed the advice that we

182
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,880
have to set up security correctly

183
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,599
so really correctly so not reporting to

184
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,720
a cio cto do it right

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,599
and

186
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,720
really do it right give the competence

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
competences a budget

188
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
but this takes time so i was not there

189
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
yet so they were the first initiatives

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,120
like doing password policies but the

191
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,360
next year 2017

192
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,720
it's uh i had to put grogo somewhere but

193
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,479
it was the year of the cloud where our

194
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,599
company decided to go cloud first

195
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,319
and something that we did always quite

196
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,800
well is if we decided to go somewhere

197
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
it's like rushing into that direction

198
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,599
it's

199
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,160
really insane pace so

200
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,039
we went to the cloud cloud first

201
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
and this is just an example how the

202
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
front ends of targets and tigers are all

203
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,080
paid media or 20 minutes

204
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,720
on a high level look like so it's uh

205
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,400
it's on kubernetes uh with auto scaling

206
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,960
cloudfront and aws waff in front so this

207
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,360
is usually how many things are built in

208
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,000
our company and underneath you see that

209
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
you

210
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,440
have always see

211
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,759
comparable how many cicd pipelines look

212
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,039
like but we have

213
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:04,960
everything as code

214
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,639
and this is a big thing

215
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,000
because in an old world

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,039
there were many manual tasks tasks if

217
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,599
you have infrastructure as code are pull

218
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,800
requests

219
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,479
and you can check that so you have to

220
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,360
formalize every change you do even if

221
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,960
you try that in an on-premise

222
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,160
environment

223
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,840
the cloud if you do infrastructure as

224
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,800
code it it forces you to do that so

225
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,960
there was no security there but as we

226
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
rebuild everything it was immediately

227
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,880
much more secure so the move to the

228
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,159
cloud rebuilding in the cloud made

229
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,559
everything more secure without having

230
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,080
security in there

231
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,599
and i said we love

232
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,760
infrastructure as code because you can

233
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,440
do a lot of things you can scan that

234
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,000
like every code and can find flaws in

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
there and you can automate things

236
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,440
so

237
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,040
but it's not just the front ends there

238
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,000
was also the back ends everyone was like

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,160
let's go to the cloud that's such a

240
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
fantastic thing even if you go to

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,279
homegate they said ah these it guys they

242
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,640
do containers we will go serverless

243
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,880
completely so they are running actually

244
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,600
really only on lambda functions it's

245
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,440
only functions only serverless that's

246
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,360
fantastic

247
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,880
and then there was cloud like everywhere

248
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,959
everyone was doing cloud moving

249
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,880
everything so on-premise data center

250
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
forget that old stuff

251
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,279
everyone was on aws except ricardo they

252
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
went for google because they are

253
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,000
different

254
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,360
so

255
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,480
and this represents like technical teams

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
we have like so many different

257
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
environments that look completely

258
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,279
different

259
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,000
but everything is as cold

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,720
so

261
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,959
let's move on um the next year of the

262
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,320
year of

263
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
reels where we really kick-started

264
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,040
security the first one is the tx

265
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,279
editorial cloud it's again not security

266
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,720
but we moved our cms for producing

267
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,760
um

268
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,480
real newspaper to the cloud so we were

269
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
one of the first

270
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,839
that really did that so everyone can

271
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:04,880
work with

272
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
its aws app stream in the cloud just

273
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,680
with a browser so this was

274
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,640
almost revolutionary i would say then we

275
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
moved to cenatch as a ddos protection

276
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,959
system

277
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,279
doesn't exist anymore it's still called

278
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,279
zenitch but it was a product of a

279
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,200
fantastic product

280
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,240
and as we moved away from microsoft

281
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,880
we had to find a new idp so we went for

282
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,839
octa

283
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,920
and i know there was a breach so you can

284
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,240
ask me later about that breach i'm happy

285
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,760
to answer that

286
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,399
and we introduced our sock as a managed

287
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,000
service we were too small to do that by

288
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,480
our own so we partnered with kudelski

289
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,120
security to do that and i was hired so

290
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,560
that's

291
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,920
actually me

292
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,800
i already didn't have any hair so i have

293
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,040
two small kids so

294
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
sorry for that and

295
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,120
when i joined i

296
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,880
my boss said

297
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,680
hey do the right things

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
we fully trust you

299
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,839
do it right what you think is the best

300
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,079
we fully trust you you have the money

301
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,839
the competence is

302
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
executed what you think is the best for

303
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,680
the company and do not look for

304
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,959
compliance

305
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,279
i said okay i'll do that so i try to

306
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,440
focus on detect and response

307
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,079
removing boundaries

308
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,399
resilience and agile so and i'll explain

309
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
what this means

310
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,040
our sock looked like that we had a

311
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,560
logarithm cm on premise

312
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,440
on premise as a cloud company

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,360
then we feeded it with all the lock

314
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
sources we had

315
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,440
you see also aws octa edr down there and

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,079
we did vulnerability scanning and in the

317
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
end we had a sock team that was doing

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,160
all the triage and all the work

319
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
and this was fantastic because it helped

320
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,200
us

321
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
really improving and getting to a much

322
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,079
higher maturity

323
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
well let's move to the next year

324
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,880
and our company is like i said we are

325
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,279
really quick in deciding and removing

326
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,320
things

327
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,120
so we decided to remove sap

328
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,760
so we looked at cloud only

329
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,120
and cloud first we looked at sap sapana

330
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
for our hr and finance system and we

331
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,639
went as one of the first or the first

332
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
customer in switzerland to work day a

333
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
sas product

334
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,920
with all the problems that come with

335
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,200
that but we had that bold move again

336
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,760
so i could forget about attacks against

337
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
sap that just no one understands with

338
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,680
that language so no longer our problem

339
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
this the next thing that we did we

340
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
moved we partnered with cyber reason

341
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,720
that's an edr vendor and introduced that

342
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,240
everywhere

343
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,639
and in my experience in the past i

344
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,560
worked with susman

345
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
splunk and we tried to rebuild that

346
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,959
but sometimes it's much easier and

347
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,519
quicker if you want to have pace

348
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,399
to

349
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,959
just take what is there

350
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,000
and

351
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,480
we have the constraints that we have

352
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,800
printing centers so who has a cope

353
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,439
supercard

354
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,920
one i don't believe that everyone has

355
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,079
that crappy newspaper that you get

356
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,079
weekly and you don't know how to get rid

357
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,959
of that but this is also printed in our

358
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,560
printing centers the answer said our

359
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,079
competitors printed in our printing

360
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,560
center the blick to everything and the

361
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,519
printing center consists of

362
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,680
state-of-the-art technology like windows

363
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
xp and these kind of

364
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,680
operating systems

365
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
and so we had to find an edr that's also

366
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
running on windows xp

367
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,480
so it's not that easy to find that

368
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,370
we also introduced lastpass

369
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:44,959
[Music]

370
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,360
i don't like the product very much but

371
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,000
it has a good feature that we can sso

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
because passwords are a problem of our

373
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,399
of the whole internet and if you then

374
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
explain people here now you have next to

375
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,880
your password a super master password

376
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,279
you have to find a super random key so

377
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,320
this is this won't work so we have

378
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
chosen lastpass because we can use octa

379
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,000
as sso

380
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,440
for the for the master key so this was

381
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,279
really helpful we introduced digital

382
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,880
shadows as a

383
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,440
dark net monitoring

384
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,240
and the colleagues here from scrt that

385
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,639
did a lot of audits and found a lot of

386
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,320
fantastic things

387
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,399
i have to say so one thing is when we

388
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,120
introduce the edr we also did the audits

389
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,360
and here sergio you see

390
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,760
that maybe it's not you in person but uh

391
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,800
we got you so during the audit we found

392
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,839
that you try to do some injection with

393
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,000
meterpreter and so on so we detected

394
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,519
things very early and this was really

395
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,720
fantastic

396
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,199
honestly if you don't have ms office

397
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,480
anymore

398
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,800
you don't find that many things because

399
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,519
it's just disappearing

400
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,360
but we still have that

401
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,240
like this one we have finance people who

402
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,360
have to work with axel for some strange

403
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,839
reasons so we we still have office

404
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,839
installations and this is from last year

405
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,519
that's the heife group

406
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:10,399
that

407
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
visited us and tried to

408
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,519
somehow do something so we we found it

409
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,440
isolated the machine

410
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,760
the guy called us

411
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
something is not working anymore yeah we

412
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,079
isolated your machine and we solved it

413
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,120
very quickly so edr helps a lot and

414
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,079
raises the bar for everything

415
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,839
and then 2019 was the year of the

416
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,440
visions so

417
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,399
i always i knew from my past experience

418
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,720
that microsoft and google are working in

419
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,279
zero trust architecture

420
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,880
environment so they have different

421
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
approaches and

422
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,279
i just love google so i looked at their

423
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
academic papers and technical white

424
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,199
papers to be on call now they have a

425
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,839
product today but in 2019 this was no

426
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
product they just did it by themselves

427
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,759
and the idea is that you have your

428
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,160
identity provider that checks the the

429
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
device context on access

430
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,360
and your identity context and it's no

431
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,440
longer relevant where you are

432
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,600
so your geolocation

433
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,440
your network is no longer the decision

434
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,839
maker it's the identity provider so

435
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:14,880
doctor

436
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,920
and this we came up with that idea

437
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,399
so and and thought okay if your client

438
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,920
has edr then everything will be fine

439
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,079
but how do we do that so this was the

440
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,279
concept and we tried to sell it

441
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,120
with that picture

442
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,440
until that's we were media at that time

443
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
so we were we got rebranded

444
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,320
this is franz bergie our cio and the

445
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,560
idea was everyone loves astronauts

446
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,800
there's just no one who hates astronauts

447
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,839
so everyone loves astronauts and it

448
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,720
should

449
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
show that you should be able to work

450
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,720
anywhere

451
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
at any time with any device in a secure

452
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,040
manner

453
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,560
even in space

454
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,920
so

455
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,920
we thought it's a nice picture so and

456
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
actually people understood it it's the

457
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
only thing it's just internal marketing

458
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,599
and the next thing we were starting on

459
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,079
was shifting left security

460
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,359
so bringing security to the left side

461
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,599
but especially to the developers

462
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:18,160
so you have different names for that

463
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,319
appsec devsecops

464
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,799
how you naming that push left we call it

465
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
shift left to date in our strategy and

466
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,000
just call product security very boring

467
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,520
but product security is better

468
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,919
understood by the board so we worked

469
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,200
together with many different teams to

470
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
build up a a devsecops

471
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,130
principles and way of working

472
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,559
[Music]

473
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,840
so and then there was 2020.

474
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,530
who knows that logo

475
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,799
[Music]

476
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,039
what is it

477
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,000
techcrunch yeah so i thought it was the

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,840
beginning of 2020 that we bought

479
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,640
techcrunch

480
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,799
that's amazing that's the company i have

481
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,559
to want to work with then i thought oh

482
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
maybe they bought us

483
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,799
but actually no we just got rebranded

484
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,840
like that

485
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,760
and when i initially saw that i thought

486
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,840
oh it's looking like that no it's not

487
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,000
but it's an amazing work of the

488
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,720
creativity company we had it actually

489
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,160
looks like techcrunch but we were

490
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
rebranded no longer uh like to media the

491
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,440
newspaper and they really wanted to say

492
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
we are a tech company

493
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,679
if you find irony that i like the logo

494
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,919
we can keep it here but it's our new

495
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
logo but with the logo a lot of changes

496
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,360
came

497
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,520
so

498
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,640
we

499
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
really said we will be tech driven

500
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,720
so this is a strong message because

501
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,520
um

502
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,000
we said we will also go cloud only and

503
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,799
with a cloud approach without microsoft

504
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,120
we had to find a way

505
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,520
with our sock how do we do that we

506
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,520
wanted to have that in the cloud so we

507
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,240
decided to not continue working with

508
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,600
kudelski

509
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
and do xdr the buzzword of the universe

510
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,600
but we actually run xdr and i will

511
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,919
explain shortly what this is

512
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,919
then we started really having a proof

513
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,840
beyond chord that's that

514
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
bc logo

515
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,440
we

516
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,559
sadly for sct we shifted more doing

517
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,720
continuous audits and crowdsourced

518
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,919
audits with

519
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,000
detectify and bug crowd so we do bug

520
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
bounty programs

521
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,640
and then we had a 32-day ddos attack

522
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
while i had a little newborn son at home

523
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,720
and this was one of the most amazing

524
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,039
experience in my life i have to say so

525
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,880
this was fantastic

526
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,280
so let's dive in i'll skip the first one

527
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,720
this is the wrist house we have a

528
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,640
development team in belgrade that also

529
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,799
develop security tools for us i'll skip

530
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,400
that so this is for those who

531
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,919
has anybody ever worked with gartner

532
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,360
yeah so it's i copied the hype cycle of

533
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,840
gartner but it's they always look the

534
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,480
same but if you look at xgr in the in

535
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
the beginning you think it will solve

536
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,919
everything

537
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,240
so even even your personal problems at

538
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,360
home will be solved then you realize uh

539
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,159
no

540
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,720
it doesn't work at all nothing works and

541
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
today we are somewhere here so it's

542
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,200
through a realistic phase what xtr

543
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,919
really can do

544
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,880
but what we do is we have it cloud

545
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,360
driven in cloud only you could say some

546
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,480
kind of modern cm in the cloud and we

547
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
have connected most of our lock sources

548
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,159
so from

549
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
the last on-prem firewalls we have but

550
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,080
mostly aws google workspace

551
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,320
um octa

552
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,400
that's good if octa is breach it's good

553
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,720
to have some kind of monitoring there

554
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,120
and the edr and we can cross-correlate

555
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
that's the magic so if we find something

556
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,400
like the hive group is coming by

557
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
we can find out

558
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,120
the whole story so did it come from an

559
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,080
email and who else received the email so

560
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,159
we can ought semi-automate a lot of our

561
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,840
playbooks that we have

562
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,280
that's xdr

563
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,080
that's the official uh

564
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,799
draft for official blueprint for

565
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,240
beyondcorp how we do that

566
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,159
and there is a little element added

567
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
that's the mobile device management so

568
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,679
we we migrate all the clients from

569
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,799
domain joint to mobile device managed

570
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,200
that makes lateral movement really hard

571
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
for hackers if there is no domain

572
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
anymore the second thing is we still

573
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,400
have a network even if it's not there

574
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,240
but you have a client access

575
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,320
but we activated device isolation in the

576
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
client network so peer-to-peer

577
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,400
communication is no longer possible so

578
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,240
if you have a compromised client in our

579
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,280
network

580
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,520
it can't access

581
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,440
someone else in the network there is

582
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
only north-south communication possible

583
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,039
so we implemented all of that

584
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,080
and octa is the decision making and

585
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
it's no longer the sock it's the cyber

586
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,280
reason

587
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,080
xdr more or less that is our sock that

588
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,080
is collecting all the log files actually

589
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,919
our board of directors understood that

590
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,559
picture so i was happy so that's why we

591
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,280
continue with using that

592
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,760
and if you go to our portal and order a

593
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,690
new computer

594
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,919
[Music]

595
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,960
um like the one that did not work so my

596
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,280
mac did not work exactly here but you

597
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,919
get that macbook air beyond corp and

598
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,679
it's the cheapest device that we have

599
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,760
cheaper than a windows computer

600
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,440
so but you get all these beyondcorp

601
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,080
devices in our store you can ship them

602
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,960
home you unbox them they are pre-joined

603
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,960
edr is deployed and you're ready to go

604
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,919
so

605
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,480
this means it's no longer a traditional

606
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,400
client engineering work

607
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,320
so the big challenge is not

608
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
the technical part the big challenges

609
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,880
you have workplace engineers

610
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,159
who suddenly have to work in a

611
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,840
completely different way

612
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,720
so this is the big change that we did

613
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,039
and then we started our buck boundary

614
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,480
programs

615
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,679
and until today we paid out almost 300

616
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,120
000 dollars

617
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,679
for more than 250 vulnerabilities

618
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
and this is uh

619
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
i would say quite far as it's quite a

620
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,720
lot it always depends on the size of the

621
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,840
company

622
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
but if we look how we do that so we have

623
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,520
several

624
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,200
back boundary programs you see on the

625
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
top side we have private programs

626
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,360
where we um start with

627
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
private access for limited amount of

628
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
researchers and we have two public

629
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,240
programs from 20 minutes intermediate so

630
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,080
if you go to targets and tiger 20

631
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
minutes be long whatever it's all in the

632
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,279
public programs and the private ones

633
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,240
are some are quite huge some are

634
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,480
at the beginning

635
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,200
if you look how we do that usually we

636
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
start with a limited scope

637
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,720
then we ask scrt to do an audit

638
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,039
and then we immediately onboard them to

639
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,520
our back boundary programs so

640
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,760
meaning that we make with the same

641
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,880
scoping

642
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,760
we start with the continuous scanning

643
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,919
that we do with detectify we connect it

644
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,320
with our bug bounty program and then we

645
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,880
start with 25 researchers

646
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,480
then double the researchers after a

647
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,640
month double the researchers double the

648
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,000
researchers until we have like 500

649
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,279
researchers

650
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,360
then we change it to

651
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,760
to a it's called joinable program

652
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,960
it's still it's semi-public so

653
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,520
researchers can join it but they see

654
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,600
they don't see that this is 20 minutes

655
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,159
and we can make some limitations that

656
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,159
researchers really need to be

657
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,159
have credibility and so on and

658
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,559
afterwards we go public sometimes we

659
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,799
increase the rewards before

660
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,919
sometimes afterwards this really depends

661
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,320
so this is what we do and i mentioned

662
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,559
detectify so we have a crowd-sourced web

663
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,000
scanning

664
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,559
and with that we um we scan that

665
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,279
continuously so all the time every time

666
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,440
a vulnerability is found

667
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,240
um it triggers a web hook

668
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
that triggers a lambda function

669
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,679
the the finding is collected and pushed

670
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,039
to the corresponding bug bound program

671
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,640
the good thing is that

672
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
if someone finds a path traversal

673
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,400
vulnerability

674
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
and it has been already found by

675
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,520
detectify

676
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,880
we don't have to pay for it it's a

677
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
duplicate so we get rid of the

678
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,320
low-hanging fruits

679
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,000
and we don't have to pay out low-hanging

680
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,600
fruits otherwise the worst thing is if

681
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
you have to pay twice

682
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,039
if a researcher finds that and then you

683
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
find it in your in your scanning you

684
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,679
think screwed i have to pay him out

685
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:42,559
and

686
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,880
it's worthless that we scan it so that's

687
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,080
how we implemented it quite simply

688
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
and then

689
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,330
the best finding we ever had

690
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:53,440
[Music]

691
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,720
there was that one so what is that

692
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,799
i i can hear the whispering so it's it's

693
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,960
looks a little bit like there's a script

694
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,240
in there

695
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,320
i yeah there's some script thing in

696
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,720
there that is changed

697
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,039
i changed that so you don't see it

698
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,400
really well

699
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,919
so this is script code so it's

700
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
cross-site scripting all this but it's

701
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,039
just within the user agent so

702
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,480
but with that the researcher could do

703
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,640
that get that what's that

704
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,039
for the more techy people

705
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,400
looks

706
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,919
a little bit like cookie information

707
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,150
and this happened at the end of the year

708
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,600
[Music]

709
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,400
um it's quite small but the researcher

710
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,000
crafted that

711
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,600
user agent

712
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,919
and just tried it out it did not work he

713
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,320
didn't get a response but

714
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,000
we had a ddos attack so we are in the

715
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,559
middle of sleepless nights i was looking

716
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,360
really terrible

717
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,760
and we were looking at the log files

718
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,840
to find out patterns from the attackers

719
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
and adjust our ddos rate limiting and

720
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,120
everything

721
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,279
and we asked our vendor please help us

722
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,159
do the same we wanted to be sure that we

723
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
don't miss anything

724
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,240
and the log file module in the rough

725
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,679
had that cross-site scripting

726
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,000
vulnerability so if you were looking at

727
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,159
the user agent

728
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,679
it triggered the cross-site scripting

729
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,159
vulnerability and

730
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,200
the researcher gained access as partner

731
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
admin

732
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,600
so it's not just us affected but all

733
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,480
customers from him and i thought

734
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,840
oh my goodness this is so bad so i hope

735
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
that no one else will find it

736
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,640
so this was the worst thing we found

737
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,240
actually out of scope

738
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,000
but we accepted it we were happy to

739
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,240
accept that so let's move to the next

740
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,000
year

741
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,799
rest in peace saanich so we decided to

742
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,760
look for another ddos solution so

743
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,600
even if they were working on that but we

744
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,679
thought let's look for something else

745
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,200
honestly they were bought by oracle

746
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
that's also one of the reasons

747
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,080
and digital shadows the next thing we

748
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,080
also said no it's not not that good so

749
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,520
we we introduced three new tools in 2021

750
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,600
um secure code warrior

751
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,440
we did code training before with our

752
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,799
developers

753
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,520
but we have like 400 developers we were

754
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,159
doing in-house training you could train

755
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,799
10 to 12 developers for two days and

756
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,799
this was just not scaling the only thing

757
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,960
that was scaling was my budget but it

758
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,480
really did not help and then you have

759
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,399
developers you make training for

760
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,399
javascript and they say yeah but we do

761
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,640
everything in bo go and the next one we

762
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,039
do everything in ruby and you think yeah

763
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
it's not it's not relevant enough for

764
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,600
them even if they all said the training

765
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,360
is good it should be relevant in their

766
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,559
language

767
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,000
so that's where secure code warrior

768
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,559
comes in cloudflare ddos

769
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,320
quite good so we replaced it and we

770
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,000
introduced laserwork

771
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,559
cloud native security

772
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,840
so

773
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,240
let's look at um

774
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,520
at our

775
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,240
code training so when we bother it's a

776
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,880
sas training platform fantastic

777
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,360
we showed it to the ctos of all these

778
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,600
aws teams like

779
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,480
a room like full of that of people ctos

780
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,440
and all set that's fantastic we have no

781
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,000
time for that honestly

782
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,120
we have

783
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,520
everything but no time so you can

784
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,159
introduce that like in in nine months or

785
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,600
ten months and i thought

786
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,399
this is sorry this is

787
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,640
we have to train people so we came up

788
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,799
and there was last october this is the

789
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,200
security awareness month usually so we

790
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,399
said okay

791
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,360
we pay out 5000 per vulnerability in the

792
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,120
20 minutes program

793
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
so let's do

794
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,080
let's partner with a charity

795
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,360
organization

796
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,520
and within that month for every hour

797
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,279
that a developer is on the platform and

798
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,240
trains i will plant a tree

799
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,960
so somewhere in borneo so that the the

800
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,279
orangutans have a good life

801
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,279
and this worked quite well and then we

802
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,080
have a famous tx conference a tech

803
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,840
conference every year and we we started

804
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,200
that

805
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,120
hack the future

806
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,039
tournament so you can do tournaments

807
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:16,640
within that so they can compete to

808
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,760
either

809
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,080
and the first ten could win in oculus

810
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,120
quest ii

811
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,600
oculus quest 2 so these

812
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,679
metaphors even if i'm not a facebook guy

813
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,279
but these things are quite uh quite good

814
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,240
and one costs around 480 swiss francs on

815
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,440
galaxies

816
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,320
so if you buy 10 it's less than 5000

817
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,240
it's less than one vulnerability we pay

818
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,000
out to some random

819
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,880
person uh wherever in the world

820
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,960
um so we thought that's a good thing

821
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,200
we did that so there's groot

822
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,440
groot is representing the tree so we did

823
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
that we did the first the campaign

824
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,440
and even if no one had time at all

825
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,760
and they were training so almost 300

826
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,320
hours in total is quite good we did not

827
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
onboard all the developers just a couple

828
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
of them but the interesting thing is the

829
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,640
statistics so people do that on friday

830
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,080
whatever

831
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,159
they do that on the weekend

832
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
and no one had to pay them to do that on

833
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,559
the weekend that's fantastic and we came

834
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,159
up to to to 180 and then we did the

835
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,399
terminal and then people were going

836
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,640
crazy and trying to compete to each

837
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,760
other

838
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,320
without enforcing anything so this was a

839
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
fantastic learning so you can encourage

840
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,480
people doing that and i would love to

841
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,399
continue doing things like that do it

842
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,120
for good so as a company

843
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
do some charity people really care about

844
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,120
the planet and

845
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,799
they learn something what no one

846
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,039
realized is that we

847
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:43,840
took

848
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,919
the real findings from our bug bounty

849
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:46,960
programs

850
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,399
we came back

851
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:51,440
and crafted courses so they were trained

852
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,159
on vulnerabilities we found in the bug

853
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,480
bounty programs so the one who is doing

854
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,760
golang

855
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,240
trained for the findings we had on their

856
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,039
platforms in golang the other in every

857
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,240
other language we could even do cobol

858
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,440
um

859
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,200
i'm more a scripter i'm more the bash

860
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,840
guy but i also did that in bash the

861
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,200
training and then i posted it everywhere

862
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,559
please beat me

863
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,120
no one may be worse than me

864
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,399
everyone beat me so that's a good thing

865
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,919
the next thing that we introduced was

866
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,039
lacework

867
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,640
so our xtr is missing the kubernetes

868
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,840
layer

869
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
and

870
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
we looked at a couple of solutions and

871
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,640
all our were not that good so we decided

872
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,240
to partner with a couple of companies

873
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,159
but laserwork is the one that looked

874
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,000
most promising so you have an easy

875
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,640
onboarding the cloud native tool it's

876
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,600
not from a traditional security vendor

877
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,679
so with that you just collect with

878
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:51,600
agents with access to cloudtrail and the

879
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,840
resource you collect all the data it's

880
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,600
running through some kind of behavior

881
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,880
based

882
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,000
machine learning if a new event pops up

883
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,480
the first time you get an alert it's

884
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
it's cross-correlated with some kind of

885
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,159
threat intelligence

886
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,919
and if you are okay with the alert it

887
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,080
will never show up again so after some

888
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,760
noise in the beginning drops down and

889
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,200
you get only a few alerts

890
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,159
per week and then if something really

891
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,480
tries to get in it is throwing a lot of

892
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,960
alerts so you see that immediately so

893
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,679
this is for example from one container

894
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,320
a python running

895
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,960
um i'm not sure if with root privileges

896
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,159
i guess

897
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,320
so this is how such an alert looks like

898
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,640
so you get really deep insights a little

899
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,200
bit like an edr but it is not an edr

900
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,480
it's different

901
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,039
and what they also provide is iac

902
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:44,399
scanning

903
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,039
so we do sas scanning

904
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,399
for like our products that we have so

905
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:51,679
all everything that is written in

906
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,480
javascript we do sas scanning but we

907
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,720
have terraform as the code for our

908
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,240
infrastructure

909
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,960
so and what they do is they scan the

910
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,640
terraform code

911
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
and they have like a little

912
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,360
github bot or gitlab bot running

913
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,679
like dependerbot for those who know that

914
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,480
so as soon as something is found

915
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
it just raises a pull request

916
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,159
automatically so you have automatic

917
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,280
scanning

918
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,719
of your infrastructure code and it asks

919
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,679
for remediating it so the devsecops also

920
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,960
the devops team they don't know that

921
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,760
they do devsecops actually but they do

922
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,639
they get the pull requests to remediate

923
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:31,359
the

924
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,639
the issues

925
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,599
and that's the beauty about

926
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,760
infrastructure as code if you have code

927
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,000
you can scan it you can run patterns and

928
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,520
that's fantastic i love that

929
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,918
so now we are at this here so

930
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,399
it's getting a little bit thin

931
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,000
the first thing

932
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,960
was sign it with fast pass

933
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,119
we still struggle you've seen that

934
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,079
before i have to enter a password i hate

935
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,720
it it's still working passwords are the

936
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,320
evil thing of of the internet so with

937
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
fastpass you can get rid of that if you

938
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,119
have a device that is managed

939
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,119
by our mobile device management that has

940
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,640
edr on it

941
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,160
i trust it

942
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,760
but you have to do something

943
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,160
additionally like an mfa like a touch or

944
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,839
something biometrics

945
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,400
but the password is not adding any value

946
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,680
at all

947
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,839
so we decided that we

948
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,400
moved to octa fastpass

949
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,560
i know octa has been breached so let's

950
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,920
talk about that in a minute but uh

951
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,720
you can do passwordless sign in

952
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,160
so if we look at that that's how it

953
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,160
looks if you go to to that fast pass

954
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,880
i even don't enter the the username

955
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,000
anymore

956
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,839
it recognizes my device if i go to

957
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,680
google wherever i go and have to

958
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,960
authenticate

959
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,680
um it's only uh octa verify that is

960
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,960
opened so i have to to my fingerprint

961
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,440
that's easier for the people

962
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,560
and if you do any phishing attack people

963
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,320
are confused because they don't know

964
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,000
their password

965
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
so that's a good thing even if it might

966
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
have some other flaws but not being able

967
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,079
to do any fishing at all anymore really

968
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,640
helps a lot so

969
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,280
okay let's move to lightspin

970
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,720
um lightspin is a israeli startup

971
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,960
very early stage but really worth

972
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
looking at it so what this is doing it's

973
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,359
more scanning your aws or google

974
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,079
infrastructure azure infrastructure

975
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,359
and then it maps attack paths on it so

976
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,680
what might happen

977
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,560
here it's an aws key

978
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,160
if you are in the cloud you find out

979
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,040
that

980
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,839
keys and roles and identities are the

981
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,240
new thing so it finds that there if

982
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,760
someone

983
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,560
is able to attack that aws key and get

984
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,800
access to that there's that github

985
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,520
runner account that somewhere behind it

986
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,079
has administrator access

987
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,720
so these are new type of attack paths

988
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,800
and what it allows is then it uses

989
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,240
guardrails

990
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,640
and gives you the terraform code again

991
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,520
code how to remediate it

992
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,400
so

993
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,800
it's semi-automated so it's not like the

994
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,960
developers use that

995
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,119
but they copy that they read that they

996
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:21,839
understand the code put it in that in

997
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,599
there iac

998
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,680
run it and then it's fixed

999
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,240
that's the beauty of infrastructures

1000
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,880
code you could also take the irm policy

1001
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,200
directly so with that we already found a

1002
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,440
couple of things so this is fantastic

1003
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,240
and the and the third thing we do

1004
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,119
it's a startup even more early called

1005
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,400
resonate

1006
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,720
where we have a design partnership

1007
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,560
they are only doing identity

1008
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,640
so they try to find

1009
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,599
risks with identities cloud identities

1010
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,760
it's very important so what they do is

1011
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,599
um they scan for example your cloud

1012
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,000
trail your identities they see for

1013
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,680
example

1014
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,280
it's also working with octa let's say

1015
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,640
andrea schneider he he has

1016
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,599
like asterix privileges but he only uses

1017
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,040
abc

1018
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,640
so it recommends

1019
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,160
to reduce the privileges to abc the user

1020
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,079
will have no impact with that because

1021
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,000
he's only using abc

1022
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
not asterix so it's finding over

1023
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,280
permissive privileges cross-correlating

1024
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
that with threat intelligence but the

1025
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,839
idea is really to reduce the attack

1026
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:33,280
vector that someone could misuse aws

1027
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,359
keys and this is something what we see a

1028
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,440
lot that this is the upcoming thing

1029
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,440
trying to abuse

1030
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,320
cloud identities so it's quite cool what

1031
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,240
they do

1032
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,800
but they are very very early stage so we

1033
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,000
we built the product together with them

1034
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,119
and that's almost it so

1035
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:55,280
if we look back um

1036
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,640
we still work with a lot of other

1037
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,599
startups so i really recommend work with

1038
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,240
startups there's a fantastic community

1039
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,640
out there

1040
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,560
i wanted to show you that graph this is

1041
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,599
the

1042
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,240
amount of incidents we had

1043
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,040
since 2016

1044
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,960
where we had to manually take care of

1045
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,280
like run a manual playbook

1046
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,560
hire scrt to help us out of the problem

1047
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,480
or other security companies we work with

1048
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,079
a couple of them

1049
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,200
and you see that it's going up

1050
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,680
until 2019

1051
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,440
and

1052
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,760
we introduced a lot of things already in

1053
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,280
2019 but it takes time to see the effect

1054
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,640
of that but you see since 2019 end of

1055
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,280
2019 and 2020

1056
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,280
it's really going down

1057
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,800
so

1058
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,760
um

1059
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,680
it's like google always advertises

1060
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,400
things like 10x it's 10x going down it's

1061
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,200
really we we have less than 10 of the

1062
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,000
incidents than we had in the past so we

1063
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,119
had

1064
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:01,119
like every day we had an incident we had

1065
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,640
to take care of

1066
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,440
now it's getting very quiet we have like

1067
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,319
two or three so this month

1068
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,400
we had one

1069
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,079
that's the octa one

1070
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,000
but it's not something where we can

1071
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,079
really do a lot about it but it's an

1072
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,240
incident that we have so it's really

1073
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,520
going down

1074
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:22,160
and you see the pandemic

1075
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,400
didn't change anything at all

1076
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
so all my peers i talked oh my goodness

1077
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,800
it's going like crazy incidents going up

1078
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,160
and i thought

1079
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:30,960
no

1080
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,599
it's not i don't know why but it's what

1081
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,839
was going down but we we we are not

1082
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,839
finished with the zeotrust architecture

1083
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,680
but we had so many elements in place so

1084
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,560
that

1085
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,000
also thanos

1086
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
maybe it has to do with that but we did

1087
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
not see the impact on that side

1088
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,000
so that's something i wanted to really

1089
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,960
show

1090
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,640
so important thing

1091
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,280
my takeaway and then you can roast me

1092
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,599
um you have to have trust

1093
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,800
if you're bored your manager or whatever

1094
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,119
doesn't trust you forget it

1095
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:05,280
then it will not work

1096
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,839
wait for that 20 minute incident then

1097
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:10,880
they will trust you so take that really

1098
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,400
misuse every incident to really

1099
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,560
place your security in there even if

1100
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,560
it's not a real incident

1101
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,920
you have to be both there to do security

1102
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,319
grogu and the cloud so i did not believe

1103
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,680
it in in i i have a banking background

1104
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,240
and i was always like these uh agile

1105
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,560
thing and so on i don't know the cloud

1106
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,680
honestly it's so fantastic it speeds up

1107
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,480
everything even if you have to rethink a

1108
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,510
couple of elements of security

1109
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,839
[Music]

1110
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:43,119
one thing is

1111
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:45,520
satisfy your security stack

1112
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,640
so

1113
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,079
you don't have to rebuild everything by

1114
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,160
yourself the beauty of sars is you can

1115
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,560
scale up scale down you can pick

1116
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,319
something if it's good if you don't like

1117
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:55,920
it throw it away

1118
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,839
that's what's good about

1119
00:41:57,839 --> 00:41:58,800
um

1120
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,480
the sarsify and your mindset

1121
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,640
it's it's all up there so you have to

1122
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,280
really rethink what is good and don't

1123
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,200
look what others do

1124
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,520
um everyone usually knows what would be

1125
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,839
the right thing so if it's

1126
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,599
thanos and getting rid of i don't know

1127
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,839
microsoft then that's the way to go

1128
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:20,240
um and then it's a question of waiting

1129
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,000
for the right incident

1130
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,200
to propose maybe that problem

1131
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,119
thanos like i said

1132
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,359
zero trust's cool everyone is talking

1133
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:30,400
about that

1134
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,319
even the ones who have absolutely no

1135
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,720
idea what zero trust really is but there

1136
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,880
are good good papers from the nist take

1137
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,880
a look at that what zero trust is what

1138
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
google is doing also microsoft is doing

1139
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,280
a lot very good work on that so look at

1140
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,000
that and go to zero trust

1141
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,480
that's a really important step

1142
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,640
and my last one is work with security

1143
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,839
startups what we learned is that

1144
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,480
if you wait for beyond corp from the big

1145
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,560
companies like google to have the

1146
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,359
product ready for you it takes years and

1147
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,520
then it takes years for you to implement

1148
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,839
that but there are already so many

1149
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:08,079
fantastic vendors out there so we work a

1150
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,240
lot with israelian

1151
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,480
security companies because they have

1152
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,960
really top-notch people

1153
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,599
most come from the intelligence agencies

1154
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,599
but they are really good

1155
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,160
um they create defending tools they are

1156
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,240
not perfect but they will go an extra

1157
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,680
mile

1158
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,599
however small you are they will go the

1159
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,359
extra mile for you to build a product

1160
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,560
that fits perfectly into your ecosystem

1161
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,200
and if you go to the large ones

1162
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,280
they might even don't know where you are

1163
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,920
sweden switzerland's all the same so

1164
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,520
they might more

1165
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,359
see you as a number the small ones see

1166
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:45,440
you as a partner

1167
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:48,480
so and now you can challenge me

1168
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,160
ask questions

1169
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,200
i'm not a twitter guy sorry so i'm

1170
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,440
almost only active on linkedin

1171
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,920
and that's the link in qr code you may

1172
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,359
scan that or not so but always happy to

1173
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,000
discuss that also afterwards

1174
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,359

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,760
thanks for sharing this amazing journey

1183
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,240
problem so you are not yeah

1184
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,440
who was uh

1185
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,760
[Music]

1186
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,319
there is a great documentary right now

1187
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,800
about the googles and how they treat our

1188
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,160
data

1189
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,480
where we have to be very careful of what

1190
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,160
we leave on the search engine because

1191
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,720
they are able to see or to know exactly

1192
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,400
what who we are

1193
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,319
and i'm surprised to see that in your

1194
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:51,440
situation you go you run with the google

1195
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,920
and you give all the data to these big

1196
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,160
companies how can you just

1197
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,760
give have a such strategy and we have to

1198
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,960
be careful about our security or our our

1199
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,359
own data yeah so

1200
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,560
um we discussed that quite a lot so

1201
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,760
shall we

1202
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,160
partner with google

1203
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,520
google is one of the largest

1204
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,359
advertisement companies in the world and

1205
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,960
they earn their money with advertisement

1206
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,760
that's true if you take for example

1207
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,079
google workspace enterprise

1208
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,160
they do not so at least at least they

1209
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,480
claim they do not use the data for that

1210
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,280
maybe they do that but honestly

1211
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,079
um it's like the decision if i go with a

1212
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:34,079
system on splunk and rebuild it by

1213
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
myself

1214
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,839
or do i trust a vendor

1215
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,720
i have no idea if cyber reason

1216
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,359
is maybe taking that data is doing some

1217
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,040
intelligence over it

1218
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,440
um but it's more speed it's more

1219
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,000
relevant for us so the threat outside so

1220
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,440
if you take the news part of our company

1221
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:56,000
so we have investigative journalists

1222
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,640
there so they do they do um

1223
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,280
investigations about russia ukraine

1224
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,960
that's quite relevant right now about

1225
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,480
the nsa

1226
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,720
about the mossad about

1227
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:11,359
extremists in switzerland so they are

1228
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:13,280
threatened all the time

1229
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,440
so trying so losing data to google

1230
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,359
is okay for us

1231
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,920
that's actually really the take we

1232
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,960
accept that but we prefer the speed and

1233
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,839
the protection we get on the other hand

1234
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,760
but yeah

1235
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,119
it's an accepted risk

1236
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,280
yep we had a question here

1237
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:38,400
thank you very much for this very

1238
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,960
interesting talk we've been in touch in

1239
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,800
2015 when everything started

1240
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,839
i got two questions one is how do the

1241
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,240
179 trees compare to the

1242
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,160
20 minutes papers which are thrown away

1243
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,280
in the evening

1244
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,200
and the more serious question what is

1245
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,040
your process for picking all your

1246
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,920
solutions so i've seen lots of new names

1247
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,720
some names known to me workday octa

1248
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:03,520
cyber reason so why them why are not

1249
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,400
others what is your process to decide

1250
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,040
this startup but not that startup

1251
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,960
that's a fantastic question so it's

1252
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,720
difficult to answer

1253
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,520
so if we look at workday we really do

1254
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,760
traditional rfps

1255
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,119
so but we are not as a company

1256
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,440
the media has a history of doing really

1257
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,480
hard decisions if we find out

1258
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
where we don't need that 50 journalists

1259
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,599
anymore we just fire them

1260
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,319
that's a brutal reality so it's it's if

1261
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,880
you are in the private sector you have

1262
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,000
to survive and the numbers

1263
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,319
honestly they're not going up we are not

1264
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:44,400
a hockey stick company

1265
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,400
the company tries to survive so money is

1266
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,880
everything so there are brutal decisions

1267
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,520
that are being made and one thing no one

1268
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,960
can afford is

1269
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,920
um

1270
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,400
that it would become too expensive

1271
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,760
then it doesn't work anymore and the

1272
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,040
second thing is that we could get hacked

1273
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,920
um so it's really like we do bold

1274
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:06,720
decisions like doing work day workday

1275
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:08,800
was cheaper and the better product at

1276
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,640
that time if you go to security

1277
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,800
companies i'm

1278
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,079
i

1279
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,839
i don't know why but i have a strong

1280
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,680
network to a lot of

1281
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,599
startups

1282
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,559
it's more a community so that people

1283
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,000
know each other

1284
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,319
it's especially in the israelian startup

1285
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,480
ecosystem there are so many if you know

1286
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,359
one one person there everyone knows

1287
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,760
everyone so it's often out of

1288
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,480
recommendations we look at that or i ask

1289
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,520
someone

1290
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,680
who might trust and ask hey do you have

1291
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,680
anything so for example we look at a

1292
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,920
company called sternum right now

1293
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,680
not sure if we will work together but

1294
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:48,400
they have they have a new technology for

1295
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,559
iot security we need that in our

1296
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,760
printing centers i you can't install

1297
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:55,760
anything on a printing machine so we

1298
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,359
need something else and they come up

1299
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,599
with some good technology there

1300
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:02,400
and it's more or less not that i

1301
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,640
am looking out for these but they come

1302
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,200
to us the startups as they know we work

1303
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:10,079
together with startups so when we

1304
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,319
started once working with a startup all

1305
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,400
the other startups came to us and showed

1306
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:17,359
what they are doing and upon that we

1307
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,280
usually then look for that but there is

1308
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,079
no real formal process for that

1309
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,880
i i have to admit that

1310
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,240
so to know

1311
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:28,720
yeah thank you

1312
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,040
because honestly if we would do a formal

1313
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,640
process we would look at how many

1314
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,800
customers do you have sorry

1315
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,079
you're out

1316
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,400
and sometimes it's like yeah we have

1317
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,040
like uh two design partners we have no

1318
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:44,079
customers and then it's for me it's like

1319
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,920
yeah but we get a better discount and

1320
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,839
that's good so let's take a look at that

1321
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,520
so and i can do that

1322
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
i'm sorry i'm we are gonna have to end

1323
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,559
it here so thank you very much andreas

1324
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,160
and if you have a few other questions so

1325
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:00,240
don't hesitate to grab andreas at the

1326
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:02,400
coffee machine and yeah ask the ask him

1327
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,599

1328
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:06,400
thank you ask me about octo

1329
