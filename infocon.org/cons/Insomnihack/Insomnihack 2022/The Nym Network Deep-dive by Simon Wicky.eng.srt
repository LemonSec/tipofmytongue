2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,040
hello everyone thank you for being here

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,520
for my talk

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,320
um

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,400
today i'm going to talk about

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,480
an area which is

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,920
often overlooked in the domain of

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,680
computer security which is the privacy

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,439
my name is simon wiki i'm a research

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,119
engineer i'm nim technology

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,079
so today we're going to briefly talk

12
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,960
about privacy on the internet

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,200
about anonymous communication systems

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,960
about the neem network

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
about website fingerprinting which is an

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
attack on anonymous communication

17
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,320
systems

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,440
and

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
last but not least the results of our

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,559
ongoing research

21
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,960
that we're currently doing

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
so first

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
what happens when you talk on the

24
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,840
internet

25
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:00,879
well

26
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
if you want to send a message

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
like

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,320
this guy here

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,840
you can send it in plain text through

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,040
the internet

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,280
but anyone but then what happens

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
everyone on the internet can see you it

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,759
could be your isp it could be your boss

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,720
it could be

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,600
intelligence agency basically anybody

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
can see what you're doing

37
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,799
so that's

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
not really good right

39
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,560
so you could encrypt

40
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,320
your communication and then problem

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,479
solve right

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,520
that's not exactly the case

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,880
even though

44
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,400
everyone cannot

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,680
read what your

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
what you're sending

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,759
everyone can still see what we call the

48
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,960
metadata basically everything about the

49
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
communication which is not the content

50
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,040
the timing when you send it the location

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,040
your identities who you are your ip

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,320
address

53
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,479
how many um the volume of what you're

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:00,960
sending if you're sending like a huge f

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,680
a huge file or simple text message

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,600
or from what device do you send it

57
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
as soon

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
as these informations are available

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,520
these guys are back

60
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,120
so i'm going to slow down this slide to

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,920
highlight two main problems

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,959
the first one is the the privacy and

63
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,959
anonymity in the what we call the

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,680
network layer so basically

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
those metadata

66
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,519
and i'm going to give you like a simple

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,760
example in the context of instant

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
messaging

69
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,560
how could you

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,879
guess a person's birthday

71
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,080
without even reading the text

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,440
just think about it for me

73
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,160
now what's

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,800
the only day of a year

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,959
like where on average you will get a lot

76
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,599
more messages from a lot more people

77
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,800
than the rest

78
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,720
and this day repeats every year

79
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,680
that's probably your birthday

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,239
the next problem is that we also have a

81
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,080
problem of privacy at the application

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,720
layer basically if this guy here wants

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,040
to to to buy a book

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,120
and maybe he's a student and he wants a

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,720
student discount

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
he'll have to prove to them to the

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,319
seller

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,879
that who is his name like i'm simon wiki

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
i'm in i'm a student i i don't know epfl

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,360
and here's my id and everything

91
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,680
it should be and it could be easier than

92
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,400
this

93
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
and that's where neem comes into play

94
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,720
basically we're building an

95
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,360
infrastructure that aims to solve these

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
two problem so the network layer privacy

97
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,200
and the application layer privacy more

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,440
on that later

99
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,959
first

100
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,879
i need to go through some definitions

101
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,000
with you

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,879
so first uh an interesting quote from

103
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,239
one of the

104
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,959
people working at tor is anonymity loves

105
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,640
company you cannot be anonymous if

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
you're alone

107
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
picture yourself you can be like as much

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,000
as much camouflage that you want if

109
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,680
you're on an empty square

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
you will be seen you have to

111
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
be in a crowd surrounded by people

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,599
and this crowd we call it the anonymity

113
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,639
sets

114
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,478
so in that case

115
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:19,600
we would have

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,759
sender anonymity the receiver of the the

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,199
message

118
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,600
cannot determine who is the sender

119
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
he might have a guess like in that case

120
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,880
it may be one of the three people

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
but he cannot no more this is the size

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
of the anonymity set

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,919
that's the same thing for the receiver

124
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
anonymity

125
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
the sender does not know who will

126
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,919
receive the message

127
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,759
now don't get me wrong he will know that

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,440
the message will go to the right person

129
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,000
he just doesn't know where this person

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,560
is on the internet

131
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,320
and last but not least

132
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,759
what's called an observability which is

133
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,800
a third party would not even be able

134
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
to tell that communication is happening

135
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,159
between two person

136
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,919
now i'm going to introduce some

137
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,080
protagonists for today

138
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,759
first we have the global passive

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,880
adversary

140
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,000
which is

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
his name suggests global and passive so

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,800
global in the sense that he can

143
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,960
observe basically every link in the

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
network in any network

145
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,479
and he's passive as well so he won't be

146
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:29,840
able to

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,039
inject traffic to drop traffic to modify

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,320
traffic only observe the traffic

149
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
next up we have the local passive

150
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
adversary which could be like for

151
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
example your not so friendly isp

152
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,479
it's the same passive adversary you

153
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,600
cannot

154
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,840
drop packets modify packets or inject

155
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,440
traffic he can only look and he's

156
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,000
located on only one point in the network

157
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
that's the difference between global

158
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,919
passive adversary and the local passive

159
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,919
adversary

160
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,240
and the last one we have frank

161
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,639
which is our honest user who just wants

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,600
to

163
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
go web browsing without being tracked

164
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,919
now what about vpns you probably

165
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
probably everyone in this room i've

166
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,479
heard of vpn

167
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,280
and it's it's fairly popular and

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,039
advertised like in a lot of youtube

169
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:26,080
videos

170
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
so

171
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,039
basically how do they work so we have

172
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,919
frank that wants to visit a website

173
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,600
so he first encrypts his communication

174
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,919
and goes to a vpn provider

175
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,440
who then

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,000
forwards his request

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,240
to the website

178
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,240
now there's a couple problem in this

179
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,639
system

180
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,039
first we have a single point of failure

181
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,199
which is not that good i mean the vpn

182
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,599
could be malicious

183
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,560
so it could be compromised

184
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,720
basically not good

185
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,000
then you could have

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,560
a global passive adversary that could

187
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
observe the link between frank and the

188
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,720
vpn and the vpn and the websites and

189
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,680
basically do correlation in the traffic

190
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,000
you could see like

191
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
picture yourself a highway

192
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,240
with a tunnel in between the tunnel is

193
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,680
the vpn

194
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,080
but if you see in each car in this

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,039
highway

196
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
is the same color

197
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,319
same color same brand they entered it in

198
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,280
a black

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
they come out i don't know yellow

200
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,919
because there's a decryption process in

201
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,000
the vpn

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
well basically if you see like three

203
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,280
cars coming

204
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,479
really close

205
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,080
and they are alone and then you see the

206
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,080
same three cars well

207
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
they will be yellow but you see

208
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,199
three cars

209
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,840
really close together after the tunnel

210
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,039
they are probably the same

211
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
and even if the vpn provider is not

212
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,240
malicious he can still see everything

213
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,520
you're doing

214
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,759
like he sees the full communication he

215
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,400
can know that franks go to this

216
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,359
particular website

217
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,960
now what about tor just raise your hands

218
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,080
in the crowd

219
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,840
those who know about

220
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,280
tor yeah that's almost everyone

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,160
so basically tori's um is a network run

222
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
by volunteers with over 6 000 nodes

223
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
2 million daily users are using it and

224
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,720
really important

225
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
the threat model does not include the

226
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,520
global passive adversary

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,919
so just quick reminder how it works

228
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
you still have frank's you still have

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,799
his

230
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,320
not shady website not at all and you

231
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
have the cloud in between so

232
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
there are a couple of onion notes in

233
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,200
between his he's gonna pick three of

234
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,000
them the guard the middle and the exit

235
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,080
and these three notes

236
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,120
will

237
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,800
um will forward the whole communication

238
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,519
now

239
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,440
it's better than the vpn because we'll

240
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
see in a minute

241
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,920
as we have three notes in the middle

242
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
no notes will be able to see the full

243
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,120
pass

244
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,279
so first he sends his traffic to the the

245
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
guard node he will not

246
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,120
send it in clear he will first encrypt

247
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,440
it with the public's public key of the

248
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
last node then the second node and then

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
the third the first node it's what we

250
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,760
call onion encryption

251
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
then the first node will decrypt

252
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,399
the

253
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,480
the the traffic and forward it to the

254
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,000
mill node because he will have the

255
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,279
instruction

256
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,519
inside the the layer of the

257
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,120
of encryption

258
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,800
the middle node does the same provided

259
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,959
to the last one the last one does the

260
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,560
same and

261
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,959
forwards the requests to the website and

262
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,160
back

263
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,920
when we have

264
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
there what we call a circuit

265
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,519
and this circuit will stay the same for

266
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,760
the whole communication

267
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,959
now what about our other protagonists

268
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:55,920
well

269
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,519
the isp is looks screwed

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,160
because the traffic is encrypted he

271
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
cannot

272
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,320
see what's happening outside

273
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
he's could right

274
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
we'll see about that later

275
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,360
and the global passive adversary now

276
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,360
he's not i know he's not in the in the

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,959
threat model of tor

278
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,880
but right now the global passive

279
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
adversary is not that irrealistic

280
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
and he can still do correlation the same

281
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,519
way

282
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
he could do on the vpn

283
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
now let me introduce you to nim the name

284
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,360
is

285
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,880
infrastructure that we are building with

286
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
the great help of exoscale

287
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
at the center of it we have

288
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,399
a mix node which is

289
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
attempting to fix the network

290
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,399
layer

291
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,880
privacy problem

292
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
we also have gateway on each side to

293
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,560
prevent um

294
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,519
uh

295
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,519
users from using the

296
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,399
the mix node for free it's acts just as

297
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,680
sort of guards from the network

298
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,040
next we have

299
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,880
the validators and the blockchain who

300
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,519
are there to provide information

301
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,240
about the network to provide a

302
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,480
credential to use

303
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
the network and also

304
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
some what we called anonymous credential

305
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,600
now remember

306
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,760
the student discount case

307
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,920
it would be great if for example instead

308
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,240
of disclosing every information about

309
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,200
myself

310
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,160
where i study like my my student number

311
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
if i could have somehow some sort of

312
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
card that says

313
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,440
okay look this is validly signed

314
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
i'm a student and then the sellers

315
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,440
because they trust the signatures say

316
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,920
okay here's your student discount code

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,120
well that's

318
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,519
exactly what these

319
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,360
anonymous credentials are for

320
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
now i said

321
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,959
a mixnet

322
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,279
a mixnet is composed

323
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,200
of mixed node

324
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,600
mixed nodes to be precise

325
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,639
a mixed node was invaded by david charm

326
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,639
in 1981

327
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,480
mainly for emails

328
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,839
and it works

329
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,519
as photos

330
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
messages come in

331
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,079
they are transformed message come out

332
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,920
i mean it's trivial

333
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,959
let's do that one more time message come

334
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,320
out

335
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,560
great so the idea

336
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,800
is that you take

337
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
a certain number of messages

338
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,120
in then as soon as soon as you reach a

339
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,720
threshold

340
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,200
you cryptographically transform them you

341
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,000
reorder them in a manner that cannot be

342
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,279
tracked

343
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,160
and you send them out

344
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,399
the main idea is that

345
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,680
the timing correlation is now destroyed

346
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,079
you cannot link a message an incoming

347
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,040
message

348
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
with an outgoing one

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,440
and

350
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,000
you have you now now have a really clear

351
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
anonymity set which is the number of

352
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,200
messages that are

353
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,839
that are in the mix with

354
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,920
with with your message actually it's the

355
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,600
sort it's um

356
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,760
it's sent in a batch

357
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,320
now if we keep this design we still have

358
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,639
a single point of failure so we can

359
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,800
and that's what david charm did

360
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,959
you change these mixes

361
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,200
and now as long

362
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,399
as one of these mixes is honest

363
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,880
everything's fine

364
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,160
but there's still some problem

365
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,880
now i'm going to address this problem

366
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,519
these problems the first one this design

367
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,519
scales really poorly

368
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,360
i mean if you change these mixed nets

369
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,320
like this this mix node like this

370
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,240
basically if you have

371
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,839
a thousand users

372
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,839
they won't be able to support the load

373
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,480
you cannot scale your network like this

374
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,079
you will have

375
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,560
a high end to end latency

376
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,839
since you're relying on other people

377
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,000
to to hide yourself

378
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
you will have to wait for them you don't

379
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,839
know if they want to send an email at

380
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,480
the same time as you

381
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,240
it could be like weeks later if there's

382
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,959
not many people using network

383
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,040
and also you have you still are limited

384
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,079
in your

385
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,000
anonymity sets

386
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,519
since you're you're still limited by the

387
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,600
number of messages that one mix node

388
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,760
takes in basically

389
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
so how can we address this

390
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
by using what we call a stratified

391
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,880
topology so basically three layers

392
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,800
of mixed nodes

393
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,279
and each each messages

394
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,839
goes through one of

395
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,240
them and the difference with tor is that

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,120
even if in one communication

397
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
each message will take a different a

398
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,880
different path

399
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,720
like this

400
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,720
to the gateway to the first mixed node

401
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
to the second one third one might be the

402
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,240
same

403
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,560
to the gateway and then to bob

404
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,119
easy right

405
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,360
now we still have

406
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,279
some issue with that like

407
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,519
how are the packets form how

408
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,839
does the mix node work because we still

409
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,720
have the the in2n latency problem

410
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
we fix the scalability

411
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,320
but we still have some problems that i

412
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,000
mentioned earlier

413
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,560
so let's get to that

414
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,399
so first things first we use this the

415
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
sphinx packet format which is a probably

416
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,639
secure packet format

417
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,639
that provides bitwise unlinkability you

418
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,240
cannot link

419
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,880
two packets by their bit

420
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
bit representation

421
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,040
it also provides integrity with the

422
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
embedded integrity tag

423
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,639
in the header

424
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,040
and it also allows us to provide what we

425
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,440
call serp a single user

426
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,639
reply block

427
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,160
if you know if you want to keep your

428
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,199
sender anonymity the guy receiving the

429
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,120
message should know like where to

430
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,720
respond

431
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,480
and basically you can do this by just

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,160
pre-computing a header like this for you

433
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,959
and

434
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,519
send it with the payload to the guy and

435
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,360
basically it's like um it's like a

436
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,959
postage pad stamp just take the stamp

437
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,480
put it on the envelope you cannot read

438
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,759
the address but

439
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,279
you are sure it will go to the right

440
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,160
place

441
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
and we do onion encrypt everything of

442
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
course

443
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
so that each mixnet can decrypt forwards

444
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,880
to the to the next mixed node sorry

445
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,959
and

446
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,040
yeah basically it works the message are

447
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,800
different

448
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,440
no nodes can see the full path

449
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,690
it's it's it's it just works i mean

450
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:44,959
[Music]

451
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,160
now

452
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,759
to tackle the problem of the end to end

453
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,680
latency

454
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,160
we are introducing stop and go mix node

455
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,040
so basically now you don't wait

456
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,399
for a certain number of message to

457
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,720
arrive you just delay them

458
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,600
watch out it's gonna be fast

459
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,079
did you catch it

460
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,280
let's do that one more time

461
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,160
look that the message are not waiting

462
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,520
they are just

463
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,439
delayed this way you are guaranteed to

464
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,640
have like

465
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440
a um an upper bound on your ent2 and

466
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,840
latency

467
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,559
and how does these delays work

468
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,600
it's what we call a poissonic thing

469
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
for those who don't speak french there's

470
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,840
a fish because poisson means fish in

471
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
french in

472
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,400
french

473
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,520
and so basically it's um the delays are

474
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,480
exponentially distributed

475
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,919
that means that

476
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,400
the uh the leaving time in the mixed

477
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
node will not depend on their arrival

478
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,520
time basically each time

479
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,919
a message leave a mix note it's

480
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,919
basically a lottery it's just you pick

481
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,440
one at random

482
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,280
inside the the

483
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,799
among the messages were already in the

484
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
mix nodes it could be one that was just

485
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,080
sent it could be once that was sent

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
maybe not years ago but minutes ago for

487
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
example it could be

488
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
it works you have one message coming in

489
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
the second one there's one message

490
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,880
coming out you don't know which one it

491
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,919
was maybe you have a third message

492
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
coming in

493
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,760
and another message coming out you still

494
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,400
do not know which one it was

495
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
there's still one

496
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,559
message in this mix

497
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,400
but you still do not know which one it

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,200
was

499
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
it's with equal probability one of the

500
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,280
three that were that were there before

501
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,600
and now

502
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,080
we still have patterns to hide

503
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,440
like here we have alice that is

504
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,600
talking on the internet

505
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
we have another user that is maybe take

506
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
uh talking a little bit less and we have

507
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,919
a user user that maybe

508
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,840
he he does nothing it's just he's just

509
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,160
idling so basically what we do is we

510
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
inject

511
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,720
cover traffic

512
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,600
right

513
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,200
after the client

514
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,039
so the client is this

515
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,200
this box there they are on the same

516
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
machine as the user you cannot observe

517
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,360
this part

518
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,960
that's really important

519
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,360
and basically it works as

520
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,280
a buffer mechanism

521
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,039
there's there's an event that

522
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,799
triggers every now and then and

523
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,400
basically he looks into the buffer of

524
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,760
real message

525
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
if there's a message

526
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,039
that is ready he just sends his message

527
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:43,039
if there's not he sends

528
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
a cover traffic

529
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,280
the cover traffic will loop back to the

530
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,600
user

531
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,320
and that's that has consequences that

532
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,080
the traffic looks the same for three

533
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,120
users

534
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,840
and basically maybe

535
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,120
some of these packets are covered

536
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,160
traffic

537
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,039
but you don't know it

538
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
now quick summary about the differences

539
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,320
of an inverse store

540
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,640
name is circuit-based routing every

541
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
communication goes to the same circuit

542
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,960
name is packet-based writing every

543
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,679
packets goes through different circuits

544
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,280
or different set of nodes name heights

545
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,960
communication patterns using um

546
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,720
covered traffic sorry

547
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,320
and it's supposed to be resistant to

548
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,480
timing analysis to to the

549
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,400
nature of the mixed nodes

550
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
when tor is not now name also has

551
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,919
rewards for the nodes

552
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,520
to encourage them to have a good quality

553
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,360
of service where tor

554
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
tor nodes are volunteer

555
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,679
basically

556
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,600
so now we have a system

557
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,559
we're going to attack it

558
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,039
so how does

559
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,240
a website fingerprinting attack works

560
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,919
so basically this is a kind of attack

561
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,720
that can be mounted by a very

562
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,640
adversary with very

563
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,720
limited capability it could be

564
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,799
your isp basically a local passive

565
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,559
adversary

566
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,840
and the setup

567
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
in this case what we call the closed

568
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,559
world setup

569
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:17,600
is that

570
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
the isp is listening between frank and

571
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,400
the anonymous communication system

572
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,880
and frank can can go to

573
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
a certain set of

574
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,480
web pages

575
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,559
it could go netflix he could go on

576
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
wikipedia whatever

577
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,039
but this set is known in advance as the

578
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,120
goal of the local passive adversary is

579
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,919
to determine on which websites does he

580
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,760
go

581
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,559
now

582
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,919
since there's a closed world setup

583
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:44,880
there's

584
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
obviously an open world setup

585
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,919
this one might be more realistic

586
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,520
in maybe um

587
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
showing how censorship works

588
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,360
so basically frank can now go anywhere

589
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
on the internet

590
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,640
but the not so friendly isp

591
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
he's monitoring a certain set of web

592
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,799
pages

593
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
and his goal now is to determine

594
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,880
does frank go to a monitor webpage or

595
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,000
not

596
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,880
like do we need to shut down

597
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,480
his communication or

598
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,039
is it okay

599
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
now a little bit of history of this

600
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,120
attack it started in

601
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,120
in 22

602
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,000
no sorry 2002.

603
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,840
by andrew hintz he worked on an

604
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,520
encrypted proxy what we now call vpn

605
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,240
and this attack used the particularity

606
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,039
of http 1.0 which was that in a web page

607
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,480
each object had one connection

608
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,159
so basically what he would do is to

609
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,520
count

610
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,080
the number of packets of each connection

611
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
like you collect data you go to various

612
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,000
websites just

613
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,520
build a histogram of the connection you

614
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,280
have and the number of packets in each

615
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,159
connection and build your data set your

616
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,200
your training data sets if you want

617
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
and then

618
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,120
collect your data on your targets

619
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,520
and just build the same histogram

620
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
matching match it again your data sets

621
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,280
and voila you have your attack

622
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,840
so let's see how this works

623
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,640
by putting up a fight round one websites

624
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,880
firing printing versus store

625
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,200
fight

626
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,000
so

627
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,679
in 2011 panchenko and ital proposed a

628
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:36,799
paper

629
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
they reached 55 percent accuracy on the

630
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000
closed world and 73 percent accuracy on

631
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,240
the open world which is quite good but

632
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,000
it can do better

633
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,200
in 2018 bats it's out proposed another

634
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,919
paper which was based on

635
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:52,640
a

636
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,679
convolutional neural network that was

637
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
made for image processing but

638
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,159
hey it still works right

639
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,120
and they reached a whopping 97.8 percent

640
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,279
in closed worlds and eighty nine point

641
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,320
two percent in open world

642
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,720
that's scary that's scary numbers right

643
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,880
there

644
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
so results of the round

645
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,960
website fingerprinting

646
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,840
win

647
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,799
now moving on to round two website

648
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,279
fingerprinting versus mixnet

649
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,600
fight

650
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,039
well

651
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:30,960
we have a problem here

652
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,760
we do not have any results yet

653
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,360
problem is that mixed nets for as of

654
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,799
today are not

655
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,880
optimized or were not made for low

656
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
latency app

657
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,960
like i said with the charmian mixnet you

658
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,919
have

659
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,520
high end-to-end latency you cannot

660
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
really realistically go web browsing

661
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,919
well now

662
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,400
we can try it with nim

663
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,200
now

664
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,080
remember it's still not optimized for

665
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
websites browsing it works

666
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,039
but it's it's not optimized and as long

667
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,240
as it works

668
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
somebody will do it

669
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,400
so we might better know how it works

670
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,400
so we first need to to capture some data

671
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,080
so here's how it works we have our

672
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,880
mixnet we have a gateway

673
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,919
on both uh both end of the mixnet

674
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,200
then we have a firefox who's hooked to a

675
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,720
an msox5 proxy to to transmit the

676
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,559
the traffic to the gateway and on the

677
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,559
other side we have

678
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,240
an implant with the name requester which

679
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,200
is

680
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,960
the component that

681
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
does the request for us in the world

682
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,480
wide web

683
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,000
and we have

684
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,640
the capture point right here would which

685
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
would be a capture point a realistic

686
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,640
capture point for um

687
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,120
a local passive adversary

688
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,399
an isp for example

689
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,120
now what we did we we took um a url list

690
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,440
from panchenko ital the same panchenko

691
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,840
that did the paper in 2011.

692
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
and so we crawled

693
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,840
through almost 700 websites 40 times

694
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,880
that's a lot of websites and that's

695
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,640
that's our

696
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,679
foreground that's a monitored

697
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,679
set of webpage in the open world and

698
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,159
that's also our closed world

699
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,799
for the background

700
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,159
we went through 100k web pages to

701
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,279
represent like the the background

702
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,200
the rest of the internet

703
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,760
we extracted various features and we've

704
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,159
fed it into a random forest which is a

705
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,559
machine learning algorithm more on that

706
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,879
later

707
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,159
now the features that we extracted

708
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,240
are based on metadata

709
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,679
basically like

710
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,440
you can see in blue we have

711
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
features that are related to the inter

712
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,919
packet timing when we see like is it a

713
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,679
long time between two packets is a short

714
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,679
time between two packets

715
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,279
based on the packet timing did the

716
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,760
communication take long did it not

717
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,600
on the number of packets

718
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,799
basically a whole lot of features that

719
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
we could extract from

720
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,960
from our capture data

721
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,480
and already now

722
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,320
you can see the difference visually

723
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,879
between two websites

724
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,080
in blue we have an example of a youtube

725
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,039
page

726
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,279
in orange it's the features of another

727
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,399
page

728
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,559
so even now even visually

729
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,840
you can tell that

730
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
only based on the metadata

731
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,399
these two web pages are different

732
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,159
so now that we have features

733
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,240
within a machine learning algorithm this

734
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
one is called the random forest

735
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,000
because it's a

736
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
not technically a real forest it's still

737
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,440
a forest but it's it is random though

738
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,520
so as probably everyone knows forest is

739
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,120
made of three

740
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,719
in our case decision tree

741
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,799
so let's say that i'm

742
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,200
i'm trying to determine if

743
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,600
what what's um what is it that is flying

744
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,640
in the sky

745
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,720
well maybe it's human

746
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,120
who knows in that case yes maybe it's

747
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,520
superman

748
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,600
maybe it's not human so it could be big

749
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,039
or it could be not

750
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,120
if it's not maybe it's a bird

751
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,799
if it's if it is maybe it's a plane

752
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,880
so basically that that's

753
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,200
that's really basic and that's how the

754
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,159
decision tree works

755
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,480
so now a forest is is made of trees like

756
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
i said you have many trees in that case

757
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,919
four

758
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,320
and you can at the end each trees will

759
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
give you a class you can take the

760
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,039
majority

761
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,000
and

762
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
it's done

763
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,840
i mean it could be as simple as that

764
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,720
unless

765
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,960
the trees are big

766
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,600
like you see this thin line on the top

767
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,480
this is an actual tree of one of our

768
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,080
algorithm

769
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,600
and there are 500 of them

770
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,120
can do a little close-up on that

771
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,600
so that's our tree a part at least a

772
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,960
part of our tree

773
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,760
and each each box is a is a note each

774
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,480
arrows each arrow is um

775
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,919
is a question asked to one of the

776
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,440
features

777
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
and

778
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,679
basically when when you reach a leaf

779
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,120
you know in which class you are

780
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,039
so quick summary it's a number of

781
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,039
decision trees it's a majority vote you

782
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,200
can take a majority votes at the end

783
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,039
and it's a multi-class algorithm you are

784
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,520
not limited to two class as some

785
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,320
algorithm are

786
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
now i'm not done

787
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,919
with the

788
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:38,840
trees

789
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,320
yet because

790
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
the first part works for the closed

791
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
world and we're going to use that for

792
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,159
the close one for the open world we're

793
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,440
going to add

794
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,360
a little bit of spice on top and that

795
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,799
spice is called a knn layer

796
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,840
so to have a key nn layer it means k

797
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
nearest neighbors

798
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,159
you have to have a fingerprint so

799
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,279
instead of just taking the majority

800
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,200
you're gonna pick

801
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,840
the the leaf index on which lift it

802
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,919
it landed so in that case the first one

803
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,159
gives three the second one is four etc

804
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,679
etc

805
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,840
now you also need a distance we're going

806
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,360
to use the hamming distance basically

807
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,960
number of different values between two

808
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
lists in that case the two and the ones

809
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,840
are different the three and the five the

810
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,360
eight and the one we have a hamming

811
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
distance of three

812
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,480
that's

813
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,120
pretty easy

814
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,799
now so basically what you're going to do

815
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,200
is when you have a test instance

816
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,000
you're going to look at the

817
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
classification of some of the closest

818
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,399
number using the hamming distance

819
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,799
and your if they all are foreground

820
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:47,520
samples just says okay so i'm testing a

821
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,480
for a foreground sample if they are not

822
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,440
just say

823
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
says that it's a background sample

824
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,600
and you can tune the number of neighbors

825
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,399
k

826
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:58,320
to adjust if you want like more for

827
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,240
false positive or more more false

828
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,200
negative

829
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
and basically we're doing it that way

830
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,640
because we have

831
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,440
way more background samples so it should

832
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,279
be a

833
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,360
it is amazing a major point if it's a

834
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,600
foreground it's

835
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,919
it's important

836
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,360
so now we're coming to the actual

837
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,039
results

838
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,480
how does nim compare to tor

839
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,440
so we have name on the left or on the

840
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,600
right in the closed world

841
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,080
we we we scored what we call the attack

842
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,320
effectiveness effectiveness basically

843
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,000
zero is

844
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
a really bad attack one is a really good

845
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,880
attack

846
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,840
so for

847
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,919
from a network perspective

848
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,240
the closest to zero the better

849
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,600
so basically for touring the closed

850
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,200
world we we are 0.5 and for name we were

851
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,679
at 0.1 which is

852
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,120
much better now

853
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,880
remember tor is really made for web

854
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,159
browsing nim just barely works with name

855
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,799
with web browsing it works

856
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,760
it's not just not optimized for that

857
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,080
and the airport world again tor

858
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,640
is around 0.5 name is a little bit

859
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,440
higher at 0.28 but we're still lower

860
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,440
than tor

861
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,600
now those results are all fancy and that

862
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,039
but

863
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,279
what do they mean i mean how can we

864
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:19,279
interpret this well the good thing is

865
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,080
that

866
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,880
with random forest we actually can

867
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,880
using feature analysis basically at each

868
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,440
step of the decision tree one feature

869
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,840
will be picked in addition a decision

870
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,320
will be made on that features

871
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,960
now if the feature

872
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
did split the data set really well it

873
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,559
will become more important so we can

874
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,600
graph

875
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,719
this feature importance

876
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,640
again we have name on the left tor on

877
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
the right you can see overall that

878
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,519
the tool features

879
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,120
the the first group of features is a

880
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,880
little bit higher

881
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,519
where name it's more like everything is

882
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,240
more squished down

883
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,919
everything should add up to should add

884
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,240
up to one so it's normal that

885
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,320
some other features in nema are higher

886
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,440
in tor i mean it just it looks more flat

887
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
than tor

888
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,080
now what we have our results we have

889
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,960
analysis it's still preliminary results

890
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
this is an ongoing research

891
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,799
but still

892
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,559
we can maybe try

893
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
other cover traffic parameters

894
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
we can

895
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,720
try to compute the overhead costs we can

896
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,159
try with a different covered traffic

897
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:31,440
strategy

898
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
and then we can try to improve the

899
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
resistance of the

900
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,760
of the network

901
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,080
so we're coming to the end of this talk

902
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,039
uh basically the takeaways are um it is

903
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,480
important to have privacy on the

904
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,640
internet so we we need to have

905
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,799
an anonymous communication system in

906
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:53,600
place website fingerprinting attack is a

907
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,880
real threat

908
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,200
on this communication system

909
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,440
and right now namesmixnet looks more

910
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,039
resilient than tor

911
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,919
now once again thanks to exoskill to

912
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,840
helping and helping us set up this

913
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
endeavor

914
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,599
if you know if you want to ask questions

915
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,239
you can do it now or contact me by email

916
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,520
or on twitter

917
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,850
thank you

918
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:21,119
[Applause]

919
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,440
thank you simon that was an awesome talk

920
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,639
have any questions for him

921
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,560
okay

922
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,639
i i start he has one then i have another

923
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,199
one so just a first question so you said

924
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,159
that um it is not very useful yet for

925
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,879
low latency applications so what is the

926
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,079
current use case that you are saying nim

927
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,480
is much better than everything else yeah

928
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,359
so right now nim is

929
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,679
is um maybe not optimized but it does

930
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,760
work with low latency app

931
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,119
the the

932
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:59,359
the main usage would be like um mail

933
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,520
maybe instant messaging cryptocurrency

934
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,800
transaction

935
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,119
all this kind of communication that are

936
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,800
um

937
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,000
that are

938
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,240
that do have a low latency requirement

939
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,320
but maybe not

940
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,160
are not that big

941
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,280
so something like zoom would not work

942
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,880
it might be hard to have a zoom call on

943
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,359
nim right now yeah okay and what is if i

944
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,760
want to surf the web with niem

945
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,560
um

946
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,440
is it i mean tour is sometimes already a

947
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,040
little bit slow because you have to wait

948
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,520
for 800 milliseconds to have your page

949
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,599
what is it with nim

950
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,480
it will be higher but we you can imagine

951
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,440
like um some sort of setup where you

952
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,280
would maybe on the mornings set up some

953
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
script to to to grab some

954
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,599
news website because you're in a heavily

955
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,280
censored country

956
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,000
and when we come back just uh go through

957
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
the pages that you don't uh download

958
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,240
some sort of web fetching and not web

959
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,599
browsing

960
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,320
that could be a use case

961
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,520
hi thanks for the talk um i have a

962
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,520
question which is sort of two questions

963
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,440
on the security guarantees i was

964
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,119
honoring so the threat model that you

965
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,839
consider is a global passive adversary

966
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,920
and i was wondering whether you could is

967
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,240
it possible that you could maybe say if

968
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,400
neem gives some guarantees if we were to

969
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,640
consider an active uh adversary

970
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,280
yeah there there are some kind of attack

971
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,599
um active attack on the mixed node

972
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,760
one of the most famous could be like the

973
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,400
n minus one attack basically just

974
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,640
um think of the the batches of the in

975
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,560
the charming mixnet if the attacker

976
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,599
controls

977
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,640
every one of them but one and the one is

978
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,440
the

979
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,280
the target messages when they come out

980
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
the attacker will be able to spot okay

981
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
this is not my message this is one from

982
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
the target

983
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,880
and this kind of attack is counter

984
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
countered by the the

985
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,480
cover traffic as well

986
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,240
because then the attacker cannot be in

987
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
control of any messages but one there

988
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,640
there are there is covered traffic

989
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,720
so my second question or sort of the

990
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,960
follow up on this will be on the mixnet

991
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
do you i wasn't sure but do you actually

992
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
provide any verifiability of the

993
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,160
functionality of the mixmet as in so i

994
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,560
was my i think it would be as a user for

995
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,920
example i may want to know where the

996
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,000
name is actually sort of doing what it

997
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,240
should be doing and it's not the passive

998
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,760
adversary that it should be protecting

999
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,960
against

1000
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
the the code is open source

1001
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,960
yeah so basically you can verify on that

1002
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,960
and the idea is that

1003
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:31,920
um

1004
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,160
we are not running

1005
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,800
the nodes of the mixnets peoples are

1006
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,200
running the note of the mixnet

1007
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,560
i guess the question is more like on the

1008
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,880
cryptographic side so i guess you're not

1009
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,960
like maybe providing a zero knowledge

1010
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,400
proof because that would probably make

1011
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,480
it super slow or

1012
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,720
yeah we will do you uh for the

1013
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
cryptographic side we have the the

1014
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,079
sphinx packet that is

1015
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
probably secure

1016
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,920
and um

1017
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,599
like i said the code is open source so

1018
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,079
you can check that we are doing what we

1019
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,839
say say we are doing okay yeah thank you

1020
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,839
i have another question yeah go ahead

1021
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,599
sorry uh so still usability uh you said

1022
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,440
there's chaff traffic so the thing is

1023
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
always sending so if i want to use it

1024
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,760
with a mobile device it will be using up

1025
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,359
my data plan is that correct or

1026
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,160
if you have if you have um

1027
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,480
your thing on yeah but you could see it

1028
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,640
like some sort of vpn that you would

1029
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,839
fire up

1030
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:30,640
uh

1031
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,480
when you want to use it then you lose

1032
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,040
the an observable an observability side

1033
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,000
of the

1034
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,320
of the idea of the cover traffic but

1035
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,160
you have to pay a price some somewhere

1036
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,079
there's no free lunch

1037
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,720
oh thanks

1038
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,400
any more questions

1039
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,760
thank you thank you for the talk my

1040
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,640
question is regarding the

1041
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,160
cover traffic so i understood how

1042
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,920
covered traffic is generated from the

1043
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,520
sender's perspective but what i'm

1044
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,599
wondering is when we send

1045
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,920
real packets right to an entity we might

1046
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,960
receive something right and thus do we

1047
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,119
have cover traffic from the the entities

1048
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:14,960
that we're sending data to because maybe

1049
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,040
there could be some correlation between

1050
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,560
like if we see packets coming back to

1051
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,839
our uh

1052
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,520
initial user then i mean that could mean

1053
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,040
that it's no longer covered traffic

1054
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,320
right yeah the cover traffic is also

1055
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,720
every user generates cover traffic so

1056
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,079
basically the guy you're sending

1057
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:32,000
messages to will be

1058
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,200
uh generating cover traffic so your your

1059
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,359
messages will be covered by his cover

1060
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:39,680
traffic

1061
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,200
that answer your question

1062
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,480
sort of but what i'm wondering is what

1063
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,200
if we see messages coming back right

1064
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,640
coming back to you coming back to us

1065
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,760
that means that

1066
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,200
essentially it wasn't covered traffic at

1067
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,560
this point right or do we have cover

1068
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,240
traffic that also goes back to like

1069
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,720
users and then it just gets ignored

1070
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
well technically you're sending like one

1071
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,640
message to one guy and then he's gonna

1072
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,000
answer back

1073
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
and so that would fill your hole

1074
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,839
the hole that you had in the the loop

1075
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,319
coming back

1076
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,200
does that answer your question no

1077
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,040
oh it's more like do we receive cover

1078
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,280
traffic well yeah our cover traffic

1079
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,280
comes back to us okay that's the the

1080
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,760
idea of the loop okay oh okay yeah okay

1081
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,359
thank you it's like you're sending a

1082
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,400
message to yourself basically

1083
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,240
thank you for the talk uh i have a

1084
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,079
question if i want to connect to one of

1085
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,200
the nime node how do i know the address

1086
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,319
who maintain a directory or how does it

1087
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,640
work yeah the address would be published

1088
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,960
in the blockchain to have

1089
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,240
a decentralized fashion where you

1090
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,400
does have some directory but you have to

1091
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,079
connect to one of them and retrieve your

1092
00:40:58,079 --> 00:40:59,040
address

1093
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,200
there you have the blockchain it's

1094
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
public you can ask the validators there

1095
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,319
are many of them

1096
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,760
all works everything works in a

1097
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,440
decentralized fashion

1098
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,520
and how do i know the address of the

1099
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,240
notes of the blockchain

1100
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
well you

1101
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
just ask the file the validators i mean

1102
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,319
there's there will be a set of

1103
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,800
validators for um

1104
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,240
for the the network that will be

1105
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,319
publicly available and then they will

1106
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,560
provide every information you need to

1107
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,760
have a gateway and then to to forward um

1108
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,240
your traffic in the in the mix net

1109
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,160
okay and second question

1110
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,319
you show us how the message go from the

1111
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:35,760
client to the server

1112
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,119
but how does

1113
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,960
how does it work for the message to come

1114
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,319
back from the server to the client how

1115
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,560
does it know how it is routed

1116
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,079
back to the client

1117
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,599
yeah so right now um

1118
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,520
the idea is to use serb

1119
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,920
so like i said uh it's like you your

1120
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,920
your computed header

1121
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,680
uh from the sphinx package you just send

1122
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,680
it along with the payload and he just

1123
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,319
used it to send back

1124
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,800
now in the version that we used

1125
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,480
um to allowing a multiple responses

1126
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
so in the version that we use to to run

1127
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,440
this attack we just give the ip address

1128
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,680
to the to the other nim client so he

1129
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
knows where to send back

1130
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,119
but the the end idea is to use serps

1131
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,760
okay thank you

1132
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,920
what's the anymore questions

1133
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,319
thanks

1134
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,359
uh thanks for the

1135
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,200
presentation i have a question you

1136
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,560
mentioned that the node have a

1137
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:43,359
kicker kickback they have a

1138
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,280
their recompense

1139
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,160
they have a gift reward reward thanks

1140
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
what kind of reward is that for them

1141
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,680
running in the network what can you

1142
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,880
offer to them

1143
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,200
we do have

1144
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,440
tokens in the blockchain that can be

1145
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,839
later used to access the network

1146
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,760
okay and so we have um

1147
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,240
proof the nodes can generate proof that

1148
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,960
they actually did good work

1149
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,119
and they will get a small um amount of

1150
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:10,319
token to

1151
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,640
as rewards to cover the cost of the the

1152
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,480
server and everything do they get to use

1153
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,000
the traffic for the tour for free right

1154
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,400
they they do get token to then use the

1155
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,359
um

1156
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,160
the network yeah okay

1157
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,000
any last questions

1158
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,240
thanks again simon please give him

1159
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,410
another round of applause

1160
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,589
[Applause]
