12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,640
head of cloud infrastructure from uh

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,160
from telstra so that telstra is a

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,280
partner

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
of aws

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,000
in in switzerland and what we would like

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,879
to

18
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,320
talk about today uh is is really um like

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,960
first of all what is uh oh

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,199
aws is approaching security in in

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,399
general

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,920
a little bit of um

23
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,000
of news about what we are doing in

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
switzerland uh because that's a big year

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,199
2022 for aws in switzerland because we

26
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,600
are opening uh a region i will talk a

27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,240
little bit more about that uh and then

28
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,040
um

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,240
going to talk about the security

30
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,479
approach and then i will end over to to

31
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,759
caller

32
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,759
explaining you how telsys can can help

33
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,840
you with your migration in the cloud and

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,600
and all topics that are linked to

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,880
security and disaster recovery

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,759
yes it's working

37
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,680
um okay so

38
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,640
first of all about aws as such for maybe

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,479
like some of you know already quite a

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,960
bit about about aws and and what we are

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,400
doing um

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,159
we have what is very important we have a

43
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,320
global global infrastructure all over

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
the world and and everything on aws is

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
based on the concept of region

46
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,280
which are uh local uh infrastructure

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,840
that we have in in many countries and we

48
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,040
have now uh like 26 region in the in the

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,399
world

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,159
and we have announced eight new uh

51
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,320
region uh that will open in the coming

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,000
months and and years

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,920
um and uh in 2022 we will have the swiss

54
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,160
region which will be uh based in the

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,120
zurich

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,239
area

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,319
that will open in second half of the of

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
the year so pretty close now

59
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,480
so

60
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
the business is uh is really um we are

61
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,599
investing a lot in in switzerland so the

62
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
region is is obviously uh one of the of

63
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,840
the important topics but also all the

64
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
the functions which are coming with it

65
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,480
um which are uh really like to support

66
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
our customers uh in in all aspects and

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,720
also uh in our partners ecosystem

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
like with with telses

69
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,080
um

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,879
yeah

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,440
so that's the plan for this year very

72
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,160
important here for for switzerland just

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,280
to give you um an idea um because that's

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,519
a question we we get asked very often is

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,680
like how how big are you in switzerland

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,519
or how much like customers do we have so

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,200
we have more than 10 000 customers in

78
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,840
switzerland from from all sides some

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,920
very famous names that you can see here

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,120
but but many but many customers in in

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,200
various areas really starting from the

82
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
big enterprise we have many startups we

83
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,599
have many isvs as well

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
and and in different

85
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,879
in different verticals

86
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,640
all right

87
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,080
so

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,560
why is a region in switzerland

89
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,480
so

90
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
there is a specificity about about

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,239
switzerland for sure it's based on this

92
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,640
on this market on its market and on the

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,159
type of customer we have and what we

94
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,000
have heard in the in the in the recent

95
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,599
years is for for many customers um to

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,480
host their data in another country um

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,840
was a problem sometimes it was a

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,599
regulatory problem like in the in the

99
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
finance industry

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,440
sometimes it was just um a wish like

101
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,879
people will we're not so keen to um to

102
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,959
host their data in the closest region

103
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,360
which is frankfurt or in uh in other

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,879
regions we have in europe like dublin

105
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,400
for for instance

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
so we have identified really this need

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
and we thought it will it would really

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,959
make sense to um to uh to build this

109
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:08,560
region for the local market in

110
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,799
switzerland

111
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,159
the key

112
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,239
benefits of having a region because it

113
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,560
will be a very standard region like

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
everything we are building all over the

115
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,238
world i will come back on that

116
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,400
but the key benefits that you get uh by

117
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,600
hosting your workloads in switzerland um

118
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,680
are like the one you get from other

119
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,600
regions but more specifically also the

120
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,680
first of all is reduced latency

121
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,440
sometimes it's not a problem if we talk

122
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,880
about latency in general from

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,320
switzerland to frankfurt it's usually

124
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
between 10 and 20 milligrams

125
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,000
milliseconds so that's for most of the

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,759
workload it's not an issue for some of

127
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,759
the workload it could be so that's

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,040
that's something to take into

129
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,560
consideration

130
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,759
the second

131
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
benefit which is very important i

132
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
mentioned it in the in the introduction

133
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,240
is data residency so as i said there are

134
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,120
some

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,199
industries some sectors like banking

136
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,320
insurance

137
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,240
but telco as well

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,160
where it's important by law by

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,240
regulation to keep some

140
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,840
of the data

141
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,600
in in the country

142
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,759
so this will be possible now of course

143
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,479
with with the opening of the region

144
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,880
and of course we have customers who just

145
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,639
prefer to keep their data in switzerland

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,080
and they will be able to do that as well

147
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,880
um

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
and then like the the benefits you you

149
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
get from like using aws all over the

150
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
world in every region um and that's

151
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
automatically from the new region

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,600
everything related to security and

153
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,759
compliance and i will come back on what

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,080
that means in particular you will get it

155
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,919
from the swiss region so it will it will

156
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
look like the other one uh in terms of

157
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,160
compliance as well and of security

158
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
features um it will be a multiple

159
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,400
availability zone region from day one um

160
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,000
i will i will explain what it what it

161
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,039
means

162
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,600
and we will have also some uh

163
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,000
some local connectivities that will be

164
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,319
in place in order for customers who have

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,400
a hybrid infrastructure for example

166
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,880
between their on-prem data center and

167
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,440
the region switzerland to be connected

168
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,440
in the most

169
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,280
secure and efficient way

170
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,479
so just

171
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,560
what is the region and and i'm sure many

172
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,479
of you are familiar with that concept

173
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,680
already

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,560
but

175
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,479
it's it's really like a concept we are

176
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,080
using all over the world all of our

177
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,360
regions are

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,840
composed of three uh so-called

179
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
availability zones three or more but all

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
the new ones are coming with three

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,639
which are basically imagine them as

182
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,800
independent data centers

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
um so

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
they are located um in

185
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,319
in different area in in the location in

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,479
that case it will be around zurich

187
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
by minimum 20 kilometers

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,360
of distance between each other with

189
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,840
different risk profiles so for example

190
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,919
we have different energy providers and

191
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,880
so on and so forth

192
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,440
they are connected in dark fiber

193
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,280
so sub millisecond

194
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,960
between them uh in a secured way and for

195
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,680
each region we have two transit

196
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,960
centers

197
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
redundant in terms of connectivity to

198
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,639
the aws backbone

199
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,000
worldwide

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,560
so all traffic is encrypted between the

201
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,599
availability zone and also on the aws

202
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:24,639
backbone

203
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,160
we have all over the world

204
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
yeah

205
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,800
that's

206
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
what i can say about the structure of a

207
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,680
region and of course the swiss region

208
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
will be exactly on the same

209
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,240
framework

210
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,960
now

211
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
this was just like to to give you a

212
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,879
heads up of of of what is coming to

213
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,520
switzerland uh and and what we are

214
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,280
deploying all over the world in many

215
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,680
more places in the coming months uh in

216
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,160
terms of infrastructure and now i wanted

217
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,400
to um to give you a summary of our

218
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,878
security approach at lws in general

219
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,199
so

220
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,240
of course

221
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
what is what is really challenging when

222
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
you when you manage an infrastructure or

223
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,919
data center or classical light

224
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,080
infrastructure in terms of security

225
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,960
and that's no mystery there are many

226
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
things which are challenging of course

227
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
but two things are really what we hear

228
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,280
from our customers are really really

229
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,639
difficult to address when you are

230
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,560
building an infrastructure over time

231
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
when you are you have created your own

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,039
data centers and the different layers

233
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
and the different

234
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,000
services and systems on top of it after

235
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,240
sometimes it's getting really difficult

236
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,159
to to get the full visibility on

237
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,000
everything which is happening so not

238
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,440
only um the um let's say like the the

239
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,680
physical infrastructure but also what is

240
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,320
happening on the on the network uh what

241
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
is happening on the servers who has

242
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,240
access to what and and so on and so

243
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,200
forth

244
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
so that's the first challenge and then

245
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,440
the second challenge is um usually

246
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
because it's not designed for that like

247
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,519
by by essence is the low level of

248
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,720
automation

249
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,200
that most of the of the companies have

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,360
in terms of how they manage their data

251
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,720
center

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,839
and that's really the two things we are

253
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
addressing um

254
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,160
much better i would say in the cloud by

255
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,480
providing like like really visibility on

256
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,880
everything that you are running

257
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,200
and providing also this capability of

258
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
integrating like automation um on on in

259
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,480
terms of operation in general that's a

260
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,200
benefit in of the cloud in general but

261
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
also

262
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,080
in terms of security in terms of

263
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,399
incidence response for example

264
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,360
and so on and so forth

265
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,320
so

266
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
basically

267
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,040
what

268
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,920
what we have in um in in in what the

269
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,880
service we are we are providing um is uh

270
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,160
is is really um like

271
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,560
allowing you um this uh this possibility

272
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,920
of first of all uh getting like like

273
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,640
global compliance and security controls

274
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,279
um like we have in all our region and

275
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,640
you get that out of the box when you're

276
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,760
using aws services um you you get this

277
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
these benefits with the workload you are

278
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,839
deploying on it i will come back on that

279
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,519
it addressed another challenge is when

280
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,839
you scale and when you you are growing

281
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,079
the more services the more systems you

282
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,200
are deploying

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,680
you will get like the same level of

284
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,480
visibility and of control on your system

285
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
just by deploying them on on the cloud

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,200
what we have as well is like the scale

287
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,079
of

288
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:41,760
where we are applying compliance and

289
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,120
security

290
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
is very high we have millions of

291
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,519
customers all over the world you can

292
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,440
imagine we have a lot of

293
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,920
a lot of requirements we have we have a

294
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,000
lot of security incidents as well and a

295
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
lot of security discussions and we are

296
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
learning really at scale a lot

297
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
about like all these topics and

298
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,120
improving over time and this is

299
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,120
something we are giving back to all our

300
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
customers by implementing new control

301
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,880
new systems new process in terms of um

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,399
of security of privacy and compliance

303
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,720
so that means also every

304
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,519
small customer starting with

305
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,680
like i don't know a few a few workloads

306
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,079
will get the same security standards as

307
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,199
the very big ones

308
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,920
automation i mentioned it already and i

309
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
will come back on that is a very

310
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
important topic that you that you will

311
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,399
get uh because everything is based on

312
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,959
api and you have a full visibility on on

313
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,440
everything you are you are doing

314
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
and in addition to that and that's very

315
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,600
important for our largest

316
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,839
customers for big enterprise

317
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,320
we have a very big ecosystem of partners

318
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,880
so that means not only partners that can

319
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,639
help you to implement

320
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,040
security in general or implement

321
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,279
workloads in the cloud but also

322
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,440
the typical partners that you are using

323
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
on-premise

324
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,360
in terms of security so that could be

325
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
your classical sim partners or

326
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
firewalls or you name them

327
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
so

328
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,680
with security comes also

329
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,079
compliance and and controls

330
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,200
our approach to compliance is really

331
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,680
to get third party audits so you can

332
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,079
imagine that at that scale with 26

333
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,760
regions all over the world millions of

334
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,880
customers and i don't know how many like

335
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,120
like millions or or thousands of

336
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,959
millions of servers and and workloads

337
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,519
and everything um this is not something

338
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,320
that can be done at doc and that we

339
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,279
can

340
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,000
basically uh do uh redo each time we

341
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
have a new customer um deploying their

342
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,959
workload on aws so our approach for

343
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,600
scaling is really to have third-party

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,760
audits and our approach as well is to

345
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,920
get like all the certifications our

346
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,959
customers are needed for their business

347
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,279
so that's just a fraction of them we

348
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,360
have more than 100 i think we have the

349
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,519
largest number of certifications from

350
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
all the cloud providers and that's

351
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,040
really uh in all areas so that can be

352
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,399
like like industry standards

353
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,680
like fisma for example or pci dcs or

354
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,839
this kind of certification uh it can be

355
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,120
local uh certifications as well like c5

356
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,560
in germany um and so on and so forth

357
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,120
so really that's important and again the

358
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,279
swiss region when it will be deployed

359
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,440
will enter also this cycle of

360
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,839
certification and we'll get over time of

361
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,000
course not from day one

362
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
will get audited and we'll get all the

363
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:48,279
certification we have all over

364
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,959
okay so we talked about the

365
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,959
visibility and control already but

366
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,600
that's okay what does that mean how is

367
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,920
it how is it implemented

368
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,720
so

369
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
one of the very important

370
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,079
aspects of of of control is really to

371
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,560
know who has access to what and um and i

372
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,600
think that sounds like obvious uh but

373
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,079
but it's not so always so so easy to to

374
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,560
know and to and to control it so

375
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,920
again

376
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,720
on

377
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,600
aws everything is is controlled with

378
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
with like identity and access management

379
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,079
uh and we have a very

380
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,320
strong and granular

381
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,639
system or set of services that allows

382
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,720
you to control your your identity and

383
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,000
your access uh from everything for

384
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,800
everything you you deploy uh on on aws

385
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
so that's users of course who are using

386
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,199
the platform but that's every resource

387
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,279
every principles every role you can

388
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:48,480
define

389
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
and we have also something which is very

390
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,440
important uh which is

391
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
really like per default when you deploy

392
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,760
something on aws it has a resource

393
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,279
whatever it has access to nothing so

394
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
it's really

395
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
like

396
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,320
a whitelisting approach

397
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,560
that you are basically forced to do when

398
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,000
you when you use aws

399
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,440
what is very important for visibility is

400
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
um is the monitoring and the access to

401
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,440
um to to what's going on so you per

402
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,120
default and that's coming out of the box

403
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,120
you get all the logs of all the api

404
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,760
calls uh which are like done on the on

405
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,720
the platform and also on um for example

406
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,680
network flow logs so that's really just

407
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,600
i remember back in the days when i was

408
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,880
uh working for as a customer and at the

409
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,199
on-prem data center it was so difficult

410
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,000
to get the network flow logs because of

411
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,079
scaling because of performance issue and

412
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,199
so on

413
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,440
literally with aws it's one checkbox

414
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,199
that you have to click and you get all

415
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,639
the flow logs

416
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,440
and then of course based on this

417
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,360
logs based on these events you can

418
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,839
trigger api calls because everything is

419
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,440
based on apis and that means you can

420
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,279
automate things based on

421
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,800
different types of events

422
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,639
and last but not least

423
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,920
you can integrate address services with

424
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,399
all your existing solutions because

425
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,639
that's a request we get from

426
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,800
many customers

427
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,480
it's very rare that we have customers

428
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,160
which are 100

429
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,240
on aws that happens we have like the

430
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,199
netflix

431
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,720
and some other customers but the vast

432
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,240
majority of our customers they already

433
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,040
have an on-prem infrastructure uh they

434
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,880
already are using maybe some other cloud

435
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,800
provider and they already are using some

436
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,720
security providers they have their own

437
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,279
firewalls for example or or stuff like

438
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,199
this and they want to manage that in a

439
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,800
in a central way

440
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,560
and to automate that all over the place

441
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,560
not only in the cloud but also on-prem

442
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,199
and to be able to control that

443
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,360
centrally so this is also

444
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,480
possible as well

445
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
so in terms of standard for privacy and

446
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,240
data security um we talked about that a

447
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,519
little bit

448
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,279
but we have we have a few a few key

449
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,640
points here you have to you have to keep

450
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,640
in mind first of all

451
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,760
when your data are in a region like

452
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
switzerland we will not move your your

453
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,919
data of course unless you want you want

454
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,480
to move them so you can really have you

455
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,079
really have the possibility to meet this

456
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,400
data residency requirement and that's

457
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
including

458
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,400
all the metadata which are um also

459
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,480
around your your workloads that means

460
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,559
for example the logs and and stuff like

461
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,520
this

462
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,799
that are staying in the region we also

463
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,320
have the procedure to implement some

464
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,480
guardrails and some

465
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,799
some compliance monitoring about like is

466
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,919
it really true that it's not moving

467
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,360
the second thing which is super

468
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,000
important is we

469
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
say to our customers like they should

470
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,160
encrypt everything because you never

471
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,880
know

472
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,600
uh and we also provide tools in order to

473
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,919
do that because encryption can be quite

474
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,640
um quite a challenge again in a in an

475
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,400
infrastructure you manage and which

476
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,240
strive at providing like

477
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
the easiest tool possible and the most

478
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,919
flexible one in order to encrypt

479
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,240
everything at rest and in transit

480
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,480
just to give you some example

481
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,559
uh we have for example kms which is a

482
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,000
key management system where you can

483
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,120
manage

484
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
your keys for all your api calls

485
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,080
and you can either use like keys which

486
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,760
has managed for you

487
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,160
or you can manage or use your your own

488
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,240
keys and we have also for example a

489
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,720
cloud hsm service which is

490
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,760
really

491
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,440
an hsm running in the with the full uh

492
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,120
with a full set of features of an hsn

493
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,559
but running in the cloud for you where

494
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,120
you can manage your keys

495
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,120
again we talked about

496
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,600
the the privacy laws in in general and

497
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,679
this is done really through

498
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,160
compliance and and certification so we

499
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,960
will

500
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,360
help our customers to comply with the

501
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,960
local laws and and

502
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,679
any regulations they are submitted to

503
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:58,640
and

504
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,960
yeah and and we provide some some tools

505
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,240
in order for you to do that

506
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
automation

507
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,440
i talked about it a little bit this is

508
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,280
really a key aspect

509
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,600
which is helping which is helping a lot

510
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,640
as as you know i'm sure about security

511
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
the less you have manual intervention or

512
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,400
the more you can focus on the really

513
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,640
serious stuff and the less time you in

514
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
resource you spend on on the i would say

515
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,760
the the day-to-day operation uh the more

516
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,600
efficient you are

517
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
so the idea is really to provide this

518
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
efficiency in terms of of operation by

519
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,360
uh

520
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,480
basically providing you some ways to

521
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,559
manage like you know in a very nice way

522
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,559
an automated way things which are super

523
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,000
important for security but which are

524
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,240
painful and resource consuming like

525
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,679
patching updating getting audit reports

526
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,960
identifying uh uh like like problems

527
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,679
very early uh and and and taking action

528
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,679
based on on that

529
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:56,559
um

530
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,080
and this is based of course on on

531
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
continuous monitoring as i said um and

532
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
uh being able to automate as much as

533
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,480
possible through a set of api and that

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,799
includes basically like i would say the

535
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,640
day-to-day operational compliance and

536
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
security baseline but also how do you

537
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,720
address threats and how do you

538
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
remediate like like security issues and

539
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,640
how do you do incidence response

540
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,679
okay so if we look at and i will not

541
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,520
detail all of them because we have we

542
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,200
are in total at address we have more

543
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,280
than 200 services

544
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,440
and it's growing every year

545
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,640
it's so it's can be a little bit

546
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,320
overwhelming so i just put on one slide

547
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,320
all the security related specific

548
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,640
services that's quite a lot already

549
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,520
here

550
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,960
you you don't have to remember all the

551
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
names but it's just to to illustrate

552
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,679
also our approach to it we have what we

553
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,000
call the well architecture architecture

554
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,360
framework which is a framework where we

555
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,360
collected a set of best practices for

556
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
customers in different

557
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,440
areas and one of this area is a security

558
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,919
we call it a security pillar and in this

559
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
security pillar we address all the

560
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,679
domains you are familiar with

561
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,840
like identity and access management

562
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,840
providing as i said like a full set of

563
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,960
services to manage your identities

564
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,799
and that goes really from managing the

565
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,159
roles uh putting the policies in place

566
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,840
et cetera et cetera

567
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,799
to a single sign-on

568
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,440
like federation with directory services

569
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,120
you may have in place already or with

570
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,559
external tools or with ad for example um

571
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,159
etc

572
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,799
we also have a set of detective controls

573
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,960
which are helping you really to

574
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
to understand what's going on and to

575
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
identify problems um so it comes from

576
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,320
like like it goes from very basic stuff

577
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,000
like one service like cloudtrail which

578
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,840
is really a log where you have all api

579
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,400
calls uh but it we have more advanced

580
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,880
services even some services like amazon

581
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
go out duty which is using

582
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,919
aiml in order to identify anomalies in

583
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,559
the logs and to help you to detect

584
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,159
really threats

585
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,320
that would take a lot of time to detect

586
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,159
otherwise

587
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,000
infrastructure protection in general

588
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,760
very classical stuff but in the cloud

589
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
like managing firewalls again

590
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,559
adwords firewall manager is a service

591
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,880
that that you can use

592
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,400
and and integrate with partners with

593
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,240
firewalls like coming from from

594
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,240
firewalls vendor or security vendors for

595
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,120
example or you can have like like manage

596
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
firewall provided by us

597
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,440
we have web application firewalls etc

598
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
etc

599
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,640
data protection

600
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,320
as i said

601
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,559
it's mainly about encryption

602
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,640
and managing secrets

603
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,880
incident response

604
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,600
and

605
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,760
that's really about services which are

606
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,840
connected to security but what happened

607
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,240
if there is a problem typically

608
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,120
backup disaster recovery

609
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,799
and and so on

610
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,559
and everything related to compliance so

611
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,400
in compliance that means

612
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,840
the report you can get from

613
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,520
from like the the stock report for

614
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,360
example or certification from external

615
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,720
party and also some capabilities for you

616
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,520
to set up some kind of real-time

617
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,000
compliance with with audit manager and

618
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,080
to define your own controls and to check

619
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,280
like they are

620
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,440
they are compliant all the time

621
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,400
as i said

622
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,240
we have the largest ecosystem of

623
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,240
security partners in solutions in

624
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,000
general many

625
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,480
known names here some are i think are

626
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,960
here even like in the in the conference

627
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,679
uh this is just to to to show you again

628
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,159
that it's not because

629
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,440
you are going in the cloud that you have

630
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,919
to change everything especially in terms

631
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,120
of um

632
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,600
of how you manage your security in a

633
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
hybrid environment

634
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,000
so that's uh that's very important and

635
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,200
and integration with these tools with

636
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,760
these services uh whether it's really

637
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,520
like on the network layer like i

638
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,840
mentioned already firewall uh

639
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,360
application security uh or even like

640
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,640
encryption uh and and and the sim part

641
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,640
of things or logging part of things

642
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
super important and also the identity

643
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,840
and

644
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,000
access control this is something we are

645
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,480
doing almost with every big customer

646
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,320
it's how to federate identities with

647
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,240
what's what they have in place

648
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,480
at the moment

649
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,679
okay and um

650
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,520
i want i wanted to conclude a little bit

651
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,640
with just to give you an overview of

652
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,400
what we call the shared responsibility

653
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,240
model that's important to understand

654
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,400
where we basically put the the border

655
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,720
between what is our responsibility as

656
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,640
aws as a cloud provider and the

657
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,559
responsibility of the customer so this

658
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,840
is called the shared responsibility

659
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,120
model because it's a shared

660
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,679
responsibility between between the two

661
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:02,640
um

662
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,320
we have what we call the security of the

663
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,720
cloud that's our responsibility we we

664
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,960
take like full ownership for it and that

665
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,120
starts with the physical security in the

666
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,440
data center as you can imagine

667
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,600
up to the level of the hypervisor for

668
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,400
for

669
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
for virtual machines

670
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,279
and but also for more and more for

671
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:23,039
managed services

672
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,919
which

673
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:25,679
which are serverless

674
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,880
where we

675
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,559
manage the security of

676
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,080
of course of the managed services for

677
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,960
you

678
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,120
and then there is security in the cloud

679
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,440
it's what the customers are implementing

680
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,279
with us and and of course you can

681
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,440
implement something very insecure on aws

682
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,480
so no problem

683
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,799
uh and uh and you can do crazy stuff you

684
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,799
can you can share your your your secret

685
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,720
keys on on github for example or things

686
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,480
like this it's quite interesting

687
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,960
some people tried it takes like i think

688
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,760
below 30 seconds until the

689
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,320
they are used by by some boats

690
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,000
so um so you

691
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,320
you you can do crazy stuff but of course

692
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,720
we provide first of all tools and

693
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
services as i mentioned in order for

694
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
customers to implement secure

695
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,559
architectures on aws

696
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,360
and

697
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,679
we provide them best practices also of

698
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,520
course that we have learned from these

699
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
millions of customers we have all over

700
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,360
the world and we provide support as well

701
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,919
whether it's through architecture

702
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,080
support or professional services or

703
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,640
partners that can help you with with

704
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,360
building secure architecture on aws

705
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,480
and

706
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,640
yeah that was it on on my side what i

707
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
wanted to share with you

708
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,960
so thank you very much and i end over to

709
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
cola

710
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,480
[Applause]

711
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,919
thank you joffrey

712
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,919
so

713
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,600
hello everyone my name is konashikovsky

714
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
and i'm the head of cloud infrastructure

715
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,039
telesis as joffrey said at the beginning

716
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,880
of the presentation

717
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,960
and i will talk to you about our cloud

718
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,520
services at telstra for the year 2022

719
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,279
first of all we will start with who are

720
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,880
we that's this because

721
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,000
i think

722
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,520
there is a lot of people who don't know

723
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,679
you don't know us

724
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,279
our services

725
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,840
the cloud migration how do you do we see

726
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,080
your cloud migration and how can we

727
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
assist you on it

728
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,520
and then we finish with a quick review

729
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,840
on backup on the cloud and with a little

730
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,320
focus on the vm on aws

731
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,720
so who are we

732
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,480
telsis

733
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,039
we are swiss cyber specialists

734
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,720
we are the sister company of scrt who is

735
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,640
the company that organized that event

736
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
insomniac

737
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,320
so we were about by scrt in july 2020

738
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,640
and we decided to create an alliance of

739
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,200
the two companies a crt more for the

740
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,520
security side and taxes for the data

741
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,039
center and infrastructure side

742
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,520
together we are more than 90 employees

743
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,679
all basing emerge in a common office

744
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,520
near the train station

745
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,279
and all our reconnect specialists in

746
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,919
their own fields

747
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,159
so for tesses more specifically it's

748
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,159
it's more than centuries of services in

749
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,559
a french part and french-speaking part

750
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
of the switzerland

751
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,640
before we were bought by a crt we were

752
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,679
known a telecom system and we were

753
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,520
renamed at telstra last year so we offer

754
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,039
proximity and

755
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,080
quality of service for our customers

756
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,480
for the integration of

757
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,559
hardware software and cloud solution

758
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,120
our ceo is a nikola lutz and our cto is

759
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,559
adriano paletso

760
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,320
unfortunately both of them are not here

761
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,000
today but

762
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,120
we have a thought for them

763
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,399
so what are today's challenges for you

764
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,320
usually it's cost optimization time to

765
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,159
market and

766
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,480
reactivity and of course cloud computing

767
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,039
is key to face this challenge

768
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:09,600
so with the implementation of a workload

769
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,840
in a new cloud

770
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,279
infrastructure from on-prem to public or

771
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,279
private cloud

772
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,039
with the automation and the devops

773
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,440
approach to facilitate development of

774
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,520
your workload and the application

775
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,559
validation tests and the implementations

776
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,440
of the solution in the cloud

777
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,399
and of course to reduce the cost

778
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:33,840
and with the paper user feels the fee of

779
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,879
of the cloud providers

780
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,880
so our service

781
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,679
for us what we can do to assist you we

782
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,120
can assist you to migrate your

783
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
application quickly and securely to the

784
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,640
cloud

785
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,039
of course

786
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,279
by switching your business need we can

787
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,080
help you to transform your your workload

788
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,120
by

789
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,720
following a

790
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,960
certain regression path that we will

791
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,399
decide on the assessment

792
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
but optimize

793
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,640
the workload once they are in the cloud

794
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,799
by ensuring the cloud scalability and

795
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,639
optimizing performance and cost

796
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:15,200
and innovate by using the latest

797
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,760
innovation service from aws for example

798
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,919
so during the clone migration we can

799
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,000
divide it in a six point uh the

800
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
assessment which uh for us is the most

801
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,520
important part of the clone migration i

802
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,640
will define the destination architecture

803
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,840
the migration strategy

804
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,520
then after that but we will make a

805
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,880
quicker

806
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,679
focus on the assessment just after

807
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,039
once the assessment is done and the

808
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,520
migration strategy is defined we will

809
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,399
set in place a pilot a sort of poc that

810
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,240
you

811
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,720
where you will be able to to validate

812
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,519
that everything is work as you want

813
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,799
then we will

814
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,799
do the migration following the migration

815
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:05,600
path

816
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,159
and the transformation if need if needed

817
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:10,240
the optimization

818
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,840
and finally the operation and

819
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,320
administration of the deployed services

820
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,840
and we also provide a

821
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,919
support for for deployed services and

822
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,000
finally automate automation with a

823
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,440
containerization orchestration

824
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,760
for backup in cloud

825
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
or

826
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,120
in a hybrid cloud we can provide you

827
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,200
some delegation monitoring

828
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,000
you can delegate your backup to us

829
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,720
to

830
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,360
to delegate your backup strategy

831
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,519
we can assist you for your migration

832
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,000
from on-premise to cloud or even for

833
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,880
doing a copy to the cloud for

834
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,240
for respecting the three to one rule

835
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,399
we can assist you by setting your full

836
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,000
cloud backup also and for office 365 and

837
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,840
an external line for example

838
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:06,399
and finally different cloud services

839
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,960
like storage as a service more

840
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,120
specifically with a netapp technology in

841
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,360
the cloud netapp cloud

842
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,760
like the type cloud we have a cloud

843
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,120
volume and tab

844
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,519
which allows you to use enterprise snap

845
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,519
mirror snap snap volt to the cloner

846
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,960
or

847
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,720
fs6 or other cloud technology

848
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,600
even video and virtual apps with syntax

849
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,559
cloud

850
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,279
which can be either on-prem or ibrahim

851
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,039
too if you want your star phone to be in

852
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,399
the cloud and your delivery controller

853
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
on premise

854
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,279
you can mix your architecture

855
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,600
and on-demand apps based on

856
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,120
the future assessments that we make

857
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,719
based on your requirement

858
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,720
so the cloud migration however we see it

859
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,240
and how can we assist you on your clone

860
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,919
migration

861
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,640
first of all the assessment

862
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,039
uh during the assessment we will

863
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,080
review every part of your workload

864
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,360
beginning with the business goal and

865
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
objective why do you want to migrate to

866
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,279
the cloud or what is the purpose of your

867
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,440
migration is it for cost

868
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,880
cost optimization or to reduce rpo or

869
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,039
something else

870
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,559
when we have the goal we have the

871
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,039
leading pass for all the migration so we

872
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,200
will begin with inventory

873
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,559
by uh doing an inventory all your

874
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,840
application

875
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,720
with the

876
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,399
identification and segmentation of the

877
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,600
workloads

878
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,679
for the migration we'll do an inventory

879
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,120
of the

880
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,039
physical

881
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,960
and software in place with storage

882
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:43,200
server databases

883
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,279
and we are this year

884
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,399
with these inventories i will create a

885
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,000
technology catalog

886
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,600
by listing all the technologies that are

887
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,519
used in your cloud to define our

888
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,600
potentially dependencies and

889
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,120
a breaking point breaking point

890
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,360
with the inventory we can create the

891
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,480
mapping

892
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,200
which is a schematic of the workload and

893
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,799
we will define application manager with

894
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,879
a meeting with each application manager

895
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:09,679
to

896
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,520
identify all the specificity you can

897
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
have in your company

898
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,679
once the mapping is done we can

899
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,599
we can define the validation of the

900
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,760
application and the migration path

901
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,839
so it's uh

902
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,320
it's based on the sixer rule refactor we

903
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,280
platform repurchase we host retire and

904
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,280
retainer so the refactor is if

905
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,079
we have access to the source code

906
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,000
and of course the skills internally we

907
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,760
can really

908
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,520
refactor your application if needed for

909
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,440
the cloud

910
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,679
replatform it's a

911
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,760
lift and shape

912
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,719
so it's uh you're changing your hosting

913
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,199
platform

914
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,239
repurchase it's a drop-in shop if you

915
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,520
want to replace an in-place solution or

916
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,839
buy your services from the marketplace

917
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,640
rios it's a lift and cheap retire if if

918
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,320
you want to

919
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
use the workload in question or the

920
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
application using the workload is not

921
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,920
needed anymore we can retire it

922
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,240
definitely or retain we have to keep it

923
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,720
on premise

924
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,920
and with this

925
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,440
this six-hour rule we define the

926
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,599
migration paths for your application by

927
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,520
using the best practice

928
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,079
practices for

929
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,040
different

930
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,040
providers

931
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
and finally we can define the the

932
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,079
migration strategy with a definition of

933
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,960
clinician workflow the target

934
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,359
networking software infrastructure

935
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,599
target apps target services and the

936
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,760
definition and mapping of services and

937
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,320
the instances that we will need

938
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,760
to define the migration plan which

939
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,440
which is a plan that will be followed

940
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,119
step by step during the migration

941
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,760
optimization part

942
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,640
so we saw the assessment

943
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,560
just after the assessment there is a

944
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,160
pilot park

945
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,839
when we deploy the workload and give you

946
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,320
access to it

947
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,640
then the migration optimization

948
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
so we follow the migration plan step by

949
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,960
step defined in the assessment part

950
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,119
then we create a client service

951
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,760
and configure it scaling if necessary

952
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,440
and then we execute the test and

953
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,240
validation plan

954
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,599
to verify everything is okay for you

955
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,119
and finally we provide you some

956
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,040
monitoring and support for deployed apps

957
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,400
in the cloud

958
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,760
with a different

959
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,839
sla depending of your super contract

960
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,720
so that's how we can assist you during

961
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,598
your clan migration

962
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,000
i speak a little quickly

963
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,440
for the backups

964
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,160
what we what we propose are

965
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:01,200
backup on-prem full cloud hybrid cloud

966
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,680
or even cloud apps

967
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,359
which can be uh

968
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,440
exchange online sharepoint teams when

969
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,520
driver

970
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,280
and some

971
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,200
integrated services from different crowd

972
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,400
providers

973
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,599
that are supported by our

974
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,599
backup in a

975
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,000
backup editor

976
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,800
so for the backup

977
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,320
we propose you

978
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,480
we have three main solutions

979
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,960
depending of your

980
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,200
require

981
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,040
if for a larger scope of our customers

982
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,160
they need to have their data

983
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,599
local in switzerland and on a specific

984
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,160
provider so we can propose a backup as a

985
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,920
service offer with implode connect

986
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,520
technology

987
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
in this solution we

988
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,680
manage all your backup and your backup

989
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,160
have a backup copy in

990
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,480
our private cloud

991
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,240
or if you don't have specific

992
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,560
requirements from your company policy or

993
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,680
something else we usually propose veeam

994
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,079
on aws or convol metallic on aws

995
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,240
we will see after why veeam and aws are

996
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,000
specific because it's my favorite but

997
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,040
if you have on-prem

998
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,200
it can be vmware or hyper-v

999
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,440
infrastructure that you need to backup

1000
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,640
and to

1001
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,400
to do a copy or

1002
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,640
something else in the cloud

1003
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,800
we strongly recommend veeam

1004
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,480
for all the functionality

1005
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,000
it comes with

1006
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,920
but if you have only office 365

1007
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,760
we push more metallic because it's

1008
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,680
really easier to deploy and to manage

1009
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,480
and

1010
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,000
and it's really um

1011
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,280
for uh

1012
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,720
user friendly sorry

1013
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
so why vmware dws

1014
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,520
first of all because it's directly

1015
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,079
integrated on aws marketplace you didn't

1016
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:00,640
have to deploy anything

1017
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,320
just three click and uh

1018
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,760
and then you have your backup solution

1019
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,680
in place

1020
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,800
you can bring your own nissan so it's uh

1021
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,880
or there is some virtual or free uh

1022
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,280
orange directly on the marketplace

1023
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,640
and moreover it's because vim supports

1024
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,800
capacity and archive chair in extra

1025
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,680
bucket s3 bucket sorry

1026
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,119
capacity here

1027
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,839
in s3 classic aircraft here and a s5

1028
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:29,599
sierra and by using this solution you

1029
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,079
can save up to 20 time costs

1030
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,040
of your backup lifecycle management

1031
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,599
because uh when you're writing this year

1032
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:39,760
you don't have to consult too too much

1033
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,720
time the the backup foiler itself

1034
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,879
actually cost nearly nothing

1035
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,079
so when you have to when you set the

1036
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,000
capacitor to your crafter so you have to

1037
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
know that you must have a scaled backup

1038
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,280
repository

1039
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,680
to define the capacity

1040
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,560
and

1041
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,400
because on the classic repository you

1042
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
don't have the possibility to

1043
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
to define a capacity

1044
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,040
and then when you do that

1045
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,440
and you are setting your capacitor and

1046
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,400
aircraft here to type after uh

1047
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,079
your veeam will deploy temporary proxy

1048
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,240
appliance to do the conversion

1049
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,480
so it's a transparent for the customer

1050
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,240
you don't have to to deploy another

1051
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,000
another

1052
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,599
peripheral

1053
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,079
services

1054
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,200
and

1055
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,480
from start to finish so

1056
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,839
this is really appreciate for our

1057
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,160
customers especially actually with all

1058
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,760
the crypto locker attack and somewhere

1059
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
so you can uh you can have a hard and

1060
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,000
replicated repository on premise or in

1061
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
the cloud and

1062
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,000
from the capacitor to the performance

1063
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,480
tear to the capacitor to the rftr you

1064
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,040
will have immutability on your backup

1065
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,480
file so you guarantee that no one can

1066
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,720
can corrupt it if you

1067
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,960
need one day to install your

1068
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,839
your backup

1069
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,960
also vim can help you to to migrate your

1070
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,839
infrastructure from a private cloud to

1071
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,359
public cloud

1072
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:35,359
on the other way from public to private

1073
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,280
with a complete review backup

1074
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,359
application integration if you have

1075
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,680
a server on private

1076
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,680
and the command file format

1077
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,920
not like you is a vendor if

1078
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,800
one day you want to change your

1079
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,560
your backup provider or your backup

1080
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,720
editor you can always consult and use

1081
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,680
your backup file

1082
00:41:58,319 --> 00:41:59,920
so will support snowball edge for your

1083
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,880
migration if you need

1084
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,280
if you need to use the snowball to to

1085
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,680
process a large amount of data

1086
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,240
aws itself boundaries and time of course

1087
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,119
and

1088
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,839
snowball edge can be

1089
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,119
clustered in multiple at the box

1090
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,760
so as we see there are backup on s3 with

1091
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,440
the capacity and archive chair the

1092
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,520
encryption and humidity immutability

1093
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:28,480
from start to finish

1094
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,599
backup from office 365's application and

1095
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:34,480
uh on premise and in the cloud two local

1096
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,800
r2 and object storage

1097
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,440
name is called latif vim is agentless

1098
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,200
because he uses elastic block style

1099
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,640
snapshot

1100
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,880
and he choose a simplex knife shot for

1101
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,400
cost effective

1102
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,880
on a on a because three

1103
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,680
repository

1104
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,160
so okay so that's it for me

1105
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,839
thank you for your attention if you have

1106
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,960
any question feel free to ask who to

1107
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,520
to come and see us at our stand neither

1108
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:06,960
scrt

1109
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,680
to downstair

1110
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,200
thank you very much for your

1111
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,320
presentation

1112
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:16,800
[Applause]

1113
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,119
i think we've got a few minutes for for

1114
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,119
questions so uh are there any questions

1115
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,400
for either draw free or color

1116
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,640
thank you um so it's a question for

1117
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,319
jeffrey

1118
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,079
um

1119
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,839
a lot of people are talking now about

1120
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,599
confidential computing

1121
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,240
and uh about the the the fact of putting

1122
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:41,119
uh

1123
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,040
intel uh gpx uh cpus in uh in the data

1124
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,079
centers

1125
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,480
on your side you have nitro like i think

1126
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,760
that uh

1127
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
is there for this

1128
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,520
well at least to answer this issue

1129
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,400
uh

1130
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:56,400
how well does nitro

1131
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,640
answers the confidential computing and

1132
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,680
do you

1133
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,880
anticipate that uh you'll have

1134
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,400
intel cpus

1135
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,880
with gpx enabled soon in your data

1136
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,520
centers or you don't need them

1137
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,599
yeah that's a that's a very interesting

1138
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,560
topic so yeah nitro is our uh is our

1139
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,200
architecture uh and for for confidential

1140
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,200
computing and we we started many years

1141
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,680
ago it's like by changing completely the

1142
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,079
way the hypervisor was was working and

1143
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:26,480
we and we know of um i've put that

1144
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,280
together in parallel with our own uh

1145
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,720
cheap pro

1146
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,599
like

1147
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,920
building and and now everything is is

1148
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,240
really uh is really in line um you know

1149
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,599
more and more customers are interested

1150
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,319
in in in that using nitro and using a

1151
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:42,319
gravity graviton processor that we are

1152
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,319
building on our own exactly for the for

1153
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:46,160
that reason there is another reason is

1154
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,240
like also performances like uh versus

1155
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,000
costs because you can you can really

1156
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,319
also save uh cost with that because it's

1157
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,720
very efficient uh now regarding a

1158
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,560
question about like more specifically

1159
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,839
intel um i don't have the answer uh but

1160
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,720
that's a very good point um that

1161
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,119
that you know we are at aws we are

1162
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,880
always saying we are working backwards

1163
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,200
from customers so uh what i can tell you

1164
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
is for sure if this is a demand coming

1165
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,880
from customer um this is something we

1166
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,640
will we will certainly consider but

1167
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,000
today i don't i don't know what is the

1168
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
plan to be honest maybe there is one

1169
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,599
does not mean there is none but i'm not

1170
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,079
aware of it

1171
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,760
any more questions

1172
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
all right thank you very much

1173
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,319
thank you
